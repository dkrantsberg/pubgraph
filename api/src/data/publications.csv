28767178,2018,Chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7) deficiency leads to delayed development of joint damage and functional deficits in a murine model of osteoarthritis.,"Elevated chemokine receptor Ccr7 is observed in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and associated with severity of symptoms. In this study, we confirmed that CCR7 protein expression is elevated in synovial tissue from OA patients by immunohistochemical staining. We then investigated whether Ccr7 deficiency impacted structural and functional joint degeneration utilizing a murine model of OA. OA-like disease was induced in male C57BL/6 and Ccr7-deficient (Ccr7-/- ) mice by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Functional deficits were measured by computer integrated monitoring of spontaneous activity every 4 weeks after DMM surgery up 16 weeks. Joint degeneration was evaluated at 6 and 19 weeks post-surgery by histopathology, and subchondral bone changes analyzed by microCT. Results showed reduction in locomotor activities in DMM-operated C57BL/6 mice by 8 weeks, while activity decreases in Ccr7-/- mice were delayed until 16 weeks. Histopathologic evaluation showed minimal protection from early cartilage degeneration (p = 0.06) and osteophytosis (p = 0.04) in Ccr7-/- mice 6 weeks post-DMM compared to C57BL/6 controls, but not at 19 weeks. However, subchondral bone mineral density (p = 0.03) and histologic sclerosis (p = 0.02) increased in response to surgery in C57BL/6 mice at 6 weeks, while Ccr7-/- mice were protected from these changes. Our results are the first to demonstrate a role for Ccr7 in early development of functional deficits and subchondral bone changes in the DMM model. Understanding the mechanism of Ccr7 receptor signaling in the initiation of joint pathology and disability will inform the development of innovative therapies to slow symptomatic OA development after injury.

29361112,2018,What is new in pain modification in osteoarthritis?,"There is a big need for the development of novel therapies for the safe management of chronic pain associated with OA. Here we reviewed PubMed (2015 onward) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and recently completed trials where pain in OA is the primary outcome measure. Three broad categories were identified: biological therapies, small molecules and cryoneurolysis. The most promising new strategy is blockade of nerve growth factor with antibodies. Two anti-nerve growth factor antibodies, tanuzemab and fasinumab, are in active development after the 2010 hold on trials was lifted in 2015. In addition, several active clinical trials are testing distinct mechanism-based interventions, including cytokine inhibition, selective μ, δ or κ opioid receptor agonists, zoledronate and intra-articular capsaicin. In addition to pharmacological approaches, cryoneurolytic strategies that directly target peripheral nerves may play a role in OA pain management, but efficacy profiles and long-term effects of such treatments need more study. Clearly, the therapeutic landscape for OA pain is rapidly expanding. Since symptomatic OA is a heterogeneous disease, the challenge will be to identify patients that will benefit the most from specific approaches.","Antibodies;Arthralgia;Biological Therapy;Capsaicin;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Cytokines;Disease;Humans;Longterm Effects;Needs;Nerve Growth Factor;News;Osteoarthritis;Outcome Measures;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Patients;Peripheral Nerves;Play;PubMed;Receptors, Opioid;Role;Therapeutics;Zoledronate",Arthralgia;Chronic Pain;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Rheumatology (Oxford),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29480410,2018,Peripheral Mechanisms Contributing to Osteoarthritis Pain.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a major source of pain and disability worldwide. OA-associated pain is usually refractory to classically used analgesics, and disease-modifying therapies are still lacking. Therefore, a better understanding of mechanisms and mediators contributing to the generation and maintenance of OA pain is critical for the development of efficient and safe pain-relieving therapies. Both peripheral and central mechanisms contribute to OA pain. Clinical evidence suggests that a strong peripheral nociceptive drive from the affected joint maintains pain and central sensitization associated with OA. Mediators present in the OA joint, including nerve growth factor, chemokines, cytokines, and inflammatory cells can contribute to sensitization. Furthermore, structural alterations in joint innervation and nerve damage occur in the course of OA. Several interrelated pathological processes, including joint damage, structural reorganization of joint afferents, low-grade inflammation, neuroplasticity, and nerve damage all contribute to the pain observed in OA. It can be anticipated that elucidating exactly how these mechanisms are operational in the course of progressive OA may lead to the identification of novel targets for intervention.","Analgesics;Animals;Arthritis;Arthritis, Experimental;Cells;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chemokines;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Cytokines;Disease;Drive;Form;Generations;Humans;Immunity, Innate;Inflammation;Joints;Lead;Maintenance;Nerve Growth Factor;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons, Afferent;Nociception;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Pathologic Processes;Therapeutics","Arthritis;Arthritis, Experimental;Chronic Pain;Inflammation;Osteoarthritis;Pain",Curr Rheumatol Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29563338,2018,An aggrecan fragment drives osteoarthritis pain through Toll-like receptor 2.,"Pain is the predominant symptom of osteoarthritis, but the connection between joint damage and the genesis of pain is not well understood. Loss of articular cartilage is a hallmark of osteoarthritis, and it occurs through enzymatic degradation of aggrecan by cleavage mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 4 (ADAMTS-4) or ADAMTS-5 in the interglobular domain (E373-374A). Further cleavage by MMPs (N341-342F) releases a 32-amino-acid aggrecan fragment (32-mer). We investigated the role of this 32-mer in driving joint pain. We found that the 32-mer excites dorsal root ganglion nociceptive neurons, both in culture and in intact explants. Treatment of cultured sensory neurons with the 32-mer induced expression of the proalgesic chemokine CCL2. These effects were mediated through TLR2, which we demonstrated was expressed by nociceptive neurons. In addition, intra-articular injection of the 32-mer fragment provoked knee hyperalgesia in WT but not Tlr2-null mice. Blocking the production or action of the 32-mer in transgenic mice prevented the development of knee hyperalgesia in a murine model of osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that the aggrecan 32-mer fragment directly activates TLR2 on joint nociceptors and is an important mediator of the development of osteoarthritis-associated joint pain.","ADAMTS4 Protein;ADAMTS5 Protein;Aggrecans;Amino Acids;Animals;Arthralgia;Biology;Bones;Calcium;Cartilage, Articular;Chemokine CCL2;Culture;Disease Models, Animal;Disintegrins;Drive;Extracellular Matrix;Ganglia, Spinal;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Injections, Intra-Articular;Joints;Knee;Matrix Metalloproteinases;Metalloproteases;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Mice, Transgenic;Neurosciences;Nociceptors;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Production;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Therapeutics;Thrombospondins;Toll-Like Receptor 2",Arthralgia;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Osteoarthritis;Pain,JCI Insight,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31351964,2019,The nociceptive innervation of the normal and osteoarthritic mouse knee.,"To document the nociceptive innervation of the normal and osteoarthritic murine knee. Knees were collected from naïve male C57BL/6 NaV1.8-tdTomato reporter mice aged 10, 26, and 52 weeks (n = 5/group). Destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) or sham surgeries (n = 5/group) were performed in the right knee of 10-week old male NaV1.8-tdTomato mice, and knees were harvested 16 weeks later. Twenty 20-μm frozen sections from a 400-μm mid-joint region were collected for confocal microscopy. Integrated density of the tdTomato signal was calculated using Image J by two independent observers blinded to the groups. Consecutive sections were stained with hematoxylin &amp; eosin. C57BL/6-Pirt-GCaMP3 mice (n = 5/group) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) immunostaining of C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice (n = 5/group) were used to confirm innervation patterns. In naive 10-week old mice, nociceptive innervation was most dense in bone marrow cavities, lateral synovium and at the insertions of the cruciate ligaments. By age 26 weeks, unoperated knees showed a marked decline in nociceptors in the lateral synovium and cruciate ligament insertions. No further decline was observed by age 1 year. Sixteen weeks after DMM, the medial compartment of OA knees exhibited striking changes in NaV1.8+ innervation, including increased innervation of the medial synovium and meniscus, and nociceptors in subchondral bone channels. All results were confirmed through quantification, also in Pirt-GCaMP3 and PGP9.5-immunostained WT mice. Nociceptive innervation of the mouse knee markedly declines by age 26 weeks, before onset of spontaneous OA. Late-stage surgically induced OA is associated with striking plasticity of joint afferents in the medial compartment of the knee.","Aged;Animals;Bone Marrow;Bones;Disease Models, Animal;Eosine Yellowish-(YS);Frozen Sections;Gene Products, Protein;General Surgery;Hematoxylin;Joints;Knee;Knee Joint;Ligaments;Male;Medial Menisci;Meniscus;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microscopy, Confocal;Nociception;Nociceptors;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Range of Motion, Articular;Synovial Membrane;Tomatoes","Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee",Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31612243,2019,An emerging role for Toll-like receptors at the neuroimmune interface in osteoarthritis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive, painful disease of synovial joints, characterized by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovitis. It is now widely appreciated that the innate immune system, and in particular Toll-like receptors (TLRs), contributes to pathological changes in OA joint tissues. Furthermore, it is now also increasingly recognized that TLR signaling plays a key role in initiating and maintaining pain. Here, we reviewed the literature of the past 5 years with a focus on how TLRs may contribute to joint damage and pain in OA. We discuss biological effects of specific damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which act as TLR ligands in vitro, including direct effects on pain-sensing neurons. We then discuss the phenotype of transgenic mice that target TLR pathways, and provide evidence for a complex balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by OA DAMPs. Finally, we summarize clinical evidence implicating TLRs in OA pathogenesis, including polymorphisms and surrogate markers of disease activity. Our review of the literature led us to propose a model where multi-directional crosstalk between connective tissue cells (chondrocytes, fibroblasts), innate immune cells, and sensory neurons in the affected joint may promote OA pathology and pain.","Alarmins;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Biomarkers;Biopharmaceuticals;Bone Remodeling;Cartilage;Cells;Chondrocytes;Chronic Pain;Connective Tissue Cells;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease Susceptibility;Fibroblasts;Humans;Immune System;Immunity, Innate;In Vitro;Joints;Ligands;Literature;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neurons;Osteoarthritis;Osteophyte;Pain;Pathology;Phenotype;Play;Review;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Surrogate Markers;Synovitis;Tissues;Toll-Like Receptors",Chronic Pain;Disease Progression;Disease Susceptibility;Osteoarthritis;Osteophyte;Pain;Synovitis,Semin Immunopathol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31862470,2020,The innate immune response as a mediator of osteoarthritis pain.,"In this narrative review, we discuss the emerging role of innate immunity in osteoarthritis (OA) joint pain. First, we give a brief description of the pain pathway in the context of OA. Then we consider how neuro-immune signaling pathways may promote OA pain. First, activation of neuronal Pattern Recognition Receptors by mediators released in a damaged joint can result in direct excitation of nociceptors, as well as in production of chemokines and cytokines. Secondly, indirect neuro-immune signaling may occur when innate immune cells produce algogenic factors, including chemokines and cytokines, that act on the pain pathway. Neuro-immune crosstalk occurs at different levels of the pathway, starting in the joint but also in the innervating dorsal root ganglia and in the dorsal horn. Synovitis is characterized by recruitment of immune cells, including macrophages, mast cells, and CD4+ lymphocytes, which may contribute to nociceptor sensitization and OA pain through production of algogenic factors that amplify the activation of sensory neurons. We discuss examples where this scenario has been suggested by findings in human OA and in animal models. Overall, increasing evidence suggests that innate immune pathways play an initiating as well as facilitating role in pain, but information on how these pathways operate in OA remains limited. Since these innate pathways are eminently targetable, future studies in this area may provide fruitful leads towards a better management of symptomatic OA.","Animals;Arthralgia;Cells;Chemokines;Cytokines;Future;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Immunity, Innate;Joints;Lead;Lymphocytes;Macrophages;Mast Cells;Models, Animal;Neuroimmunomodulation;Nociceptors;Osteoarthritis;Overall;Pain;Play;Production;Receptors, Pattern Recognition;Review;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Synovitis;Toll-Like Receptors",Arthralgia;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Synovitis,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31982564,2020,Microarray analyses of the dorsal root ganglia support a role for innate neuro-immune pathways in persistent pain in experimental osteoarthritis.,"Following destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), mice develop experimental osteoarthritis (OA) and associated pain behaviors that are dependent on the stage of disease. We aimed to describe changes in gene expression in knee-innervating dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after surgery, in order to identify molecular pathways associated with three pre-defined pain phenotypes: ""post-surgical pain"", ""early-stage OA pain"", and ""persistent OA pain"". We performed DMM or sham surgery in 10-week old male C57BL/6 mice and harvested L3-L5 DRG 4, 8, and 16 weeks after surgery or from age-matched naïve mice (n = 3/group). RNA was extracted and an Affymetrix Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0 was performed. Three pain phenotypes were defined: ""post-surgical pain"" (sham and DMM 4-week vs 14-week old naïve), ""early OA pain"" (DMM 4-week vs sham 4-week), and ""persistent OA pain"" (DMM 8- and 16-week vs naïve and sham 8- and 16-week). 'Top hit' genes were defined as P &lt; 0.001. Pathway analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) was conducted using differentially expressed genes defined as P &lt; 0.05. In addition, we performed qPCR for Ngf and immunohistochemistry for F4/80+ macrophages in the DRG. For each phenotype, top hit genes identified a small number of differentially expressed genes, some of which have been previously associated with pain (7/67 for ""post-surgical pain""; 2/14 for ""early OA pain""; 8/37 for ""persistent OA pain""). Overlap between groups was limited, with 8 genes differentially regulated (P &lt; 0.05) in all three phenotypes. Pathway analysis showed that in the persistent OA pain phase many of the functions of differentially regulated genes are related to immune cell recruitment and activation. Genes previously linked to OA pain (CX3CL1, CCL2, TLR1, and NGF) were upregulated in this phenotype and contributed to activation of the neuroinflammation canonical pathway. In separate sets of mice, we confirmed that Ngf was elevated in the DRG 8 weeks after DMM (P = 0.03), and numbers of F4/80+ macrophages were increased 16 weeks after DMM (P = 0.002 vs Sham). These transcriptomics findings support the idea that distinct molecular pathways discriminate early from persistent OA pain. Pathway analysis suggests neuroimmune interactions in the DRG contribute to initiation and maintenance of pain in OA.","Animals;Arthralgia;Arthritis, Experimental;Behavior;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease;Disease Progression;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;General Surgery;Genes;Immunity, Innate;Immunohistochemistry;Knee;Macrophages;Maintenance;Male;Medial Menisci;Menisci, Tibial;Mice;Microarray Analysis;Nerve Growth Factor;Neuroimmunomodulation;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Phenotype;Polymerase Chain Reaction;RNA;RNA, Messenger;Role;Toll-Like Receptors;Transcriptome","Arthralgia;Arthritis, Experimental;Disease Progression;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32694383,2021,Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in a dish: dorsal root ganglion cells treated in vitro with paclitaxel show biochemical and physiological responses parallel to that seen in vivo.,"The mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy have yet to be fully elucidated, but primary afferent neurons have emerged as an especially vulnerable initiating pathophysiological target. An important recent study has also shown that the initial toxicity produced by paclitaxel in patients was highly predictive of long-term outcome. In this study, we therefore focused on defining the mechanisms of acute toxicity produced by paclitaxel treatment on primary sensory neurons under in vitro conditions. In primary rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture with paclitaxel, an increase of pERK and pp38 was observed at 2 hours, and this was accompanied by an increase in expression and release of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). There was no change in pJNK. The increase in pERK was sustained at 48 hours of exposure when the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and IL-6 was also increased. IL-6 and CCL2 were colocalized to TLR4-positive cells, and all these responses were prevented by coincubation with a TLR4 antagonist (LPS-RS). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that DRG neurons developed spontaneous depolarizing fluctuations (DSFs) in membrane potential and hyperexcitability to current injection but no ectopic action potential activity at 24 and 48 hours of paclitaxel incubation. However, CCL2 applied to cultured neurons not only induced DSFs but also evoked action potentials. Evidence of oxidative stress and mitotoxicity was observed at 48 hours of exposure. These results closely parallel the responses measured in the DRG with paclitaxel exposure in vivo and so indicate that acute toxicity of paclitaxel on the DRG can be modelled using an in vitro approach.","Action Potentials;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Cells;Chemokines, CC;Culture;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;In Vitro;Injections;Interleukin-6;Ligands;Membrane Potentials;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Oxidative Stress;Paclitaxel;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Sensory Receptor Cells;Therapeutics",Ganglion Cysts;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33128175,2021,"Blockers of Wnt3a, Wnt10a, or β-Catenin Prevent Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain In Vivo.","Although chemotherapy is a key cancer treatment, many chemotherapeutic drugs produce chronic neuropathic pain, called chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP), which is a dose-limiting adverse effect. To date, there is no medicine that prevents CINP in cancer patients and survivors. We determined whether blockers of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway prevent CINP. Neuropathic pain was induced by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (PAC) on four alternate days in male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Axin2-LacZ knock-in mice. XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14, Wnt/β-catenin blockers, were administered intraperitoneally as a single or multiple doses before or after injury. Mechanical allodynia, phosphoproteome profiling, Wnt ligands, and inflammatory mediators were measured by von Frey filament, phosphoproteomics, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. Localization of β-catenin was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) in rats and human. Our phosphoproteome profiling of CINP rats revealed significant phosphorylation changes in Wnt signaling components. Importantly, repeated systemic injections of XAV-939 or LGK-974 prevented the development of CINP in rats. In addition, XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14 ameliorated CINP. PAC increased Wnt3a and Wnt10a, activated β-catenin in DRG, and increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1β in DRG. PAC also upregulated rAxin2 in mice. Furthermore, β-catenin was expressed in neurons, including calcitonin gene-related protein-expressing neurons and satellite cells in rat and human DRG. In conclusion, chemotherapy increases Wnt3a, Wnt10a, and β-catenin in DRG and their pharmacological blockers prevent and ameliorate CINP, suggesting a target for the prevention and treatment of CINP.","Animals;Blot, Western;Blotting, Western;Calcitonin;Cancer;Cells;Chemokine CCL2;Dates;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Injections;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Injuries;Interleukin-1beta;Ligands;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Medicine;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Neuralgia;Neurons;Paclitaxel;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphorylation;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Proteins;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Reverse Transcription;Signal Transduction;Survivors;Therapeutics;Wnt Proteins;Wnt Signaling;Wnt Signaling Pathway;Wnt3A Protein;beta Catenin",Cancer;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia,Neurotherapeutics,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33550628,2021,Convergence of peptidergic and non-peptidergic protein markers in the human dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn.,"Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non-peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long-standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non-peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co-expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1-2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.","Adult;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Comprehension;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Eosine Yellowish-(YS);Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Hematoxylin;Humans;Lamina I;Male;Mice;Middle Aged;Nature;Neurons;Nociceptors;Organ Donors;Organizations;Posterior Horn Cells;Primates;Projection;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Purinergic P2X3;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Staining;Substantia Gelatinosa",Ganglion Cysts,J Comp Neurol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33753496,2021,The CysLT2R receptor mediates leukotriene C4-driven acute and chronic itch.,"Acute and chronic itch are burdensome manifestations of skin pathologies including allergic skin diseases and atopic dermatitis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), comprising LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are produced by immune cells during type 2 inflammation. Here, we uncover a role for LTC4 and its signaling through the CysLT receptor 2 (CysLT2R) in itch. Cysltr2 transcript is highly expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons linked to itch in mice. We also detected CYSLTR2 in a broad population of human DRG neurons. Injection of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) or its nonhydrolyzable form NMLTC4, but neither LTD4 nor LTE4, induced dose-dependent itch but not pain behaviors in mice. LTC4-mediated itch differed in bout duration and kinetics from pruritogens histamine, compound 48/80, and chloroquine. NMLTC4-induced itch was abrogated in mice deficient for Cysltr2 or when deficiency was restricted to radioresistant cells. Itch was unaffected in mice deficient for Cysltr1, Trpv1, or mast cells (WSh mice). CysLT2R played a role in itch in the MC903 mouse model of chronic itch and dermatitis, but not in models of dry skin or compound 48/80- or Alternaria-induced itch. In MC903-treated mice, CysLT levels increased in skin over time, and Cysltr2 -/- mice showed decreased itch in the chronic phase of inflammation. Collectively, our study reveals that LTC4 acts through CysLT2R as its physiological receptor to induce itch, and CysLT2R contributes to itch in a model of dermatitis. Therefore, targeting CysLT signaling may be a promising approach to treat inflammatory itch.","Alternaria;Animals;Behavior;Cells;Chloroquine;Chronic Disease;Compound 48-80;Dermatitis;Dermatitis, Atopic;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Form;Ganglia, Spinal;Histamine;Humans;Inflammation;Injections;Kinetics;Leukotriene C4;Leukotriene D4;Leukotriene E4;Leukotrienes;Mast Cells;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Neurons;Pain;Pathology;Population;Pruritus;Receptors, Leukotriene;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Skin;Skin Diseases;Time","Chronic Disease;Dermatitis;Dermatitis, Atopic;Inflammation;Pain;Pruritus;Skin Diseases",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

33981927,2021,Neuroimmune interactions and osteoarthritis pain: focus on macrophages.,"Bidirectional interactions between the immune system and the nervous system are increasingly appreciated as playing a pathogenic role in chronic pain. Unraveling the mechanisms by which inflammatory pain is mediated through communication between nerves and immune cells may lead to exciting new strategies for therapeutic intervention. In this narrative review, we focus on the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) pain. From regulating homeostasis to conducting phagocytosis, and from inducing inflammation to resolving it, macrophages are plastic cells that are highly adaptable to their environment. They rely on communicating with the environment through cytokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, and other signals to respond to inflammation or injury. The contribution of macrophages to OA joint damage has garnered much attention in recent years. Here, we discuss how macrophages may participate in the initiation and maintenance of pain in OA. We aim to summarize what is currently known about macrophages in OA pain and identify important gaps in the field to fuel future investigations.","Attention;Cells;Chronic Pain;Communication;Cytokines;Environment;Future;Growth Factors;Homeostasis;Immune System;Inflammation;Injuries;Joints;Lead;Macrophages;Maintenance;Models, Animal;Nervous System;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neuropeptides;News;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Phagocytosis;Plastics;Review;Role;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Inflammation;Injuries;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Pain Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34128530,2021,Studying human nociceptors: from fundamentals to clinic.,"Chronic pain affects one in five of the general population and is the third most important cause of disability-adjusted life-years globally. Unfortunately, treatment remains inadequate due to poor efficacy and tolerability. There has been a failure in translating promising preclinical drug targets into clinic use. This reflects challenges across the whole drug development pathway, from preclinical models to trial design. Nociceptors remain an attractive therapeutic target: their sensitization makes an important contribution to many chronic pain states, they are located outside the blood-brain barrier, and they are relatively specific. The past decade has seen significant advances in the techniques available to study human nociceptors, including: the use of corneal confocal microscopy and biopsy samples to observe nociceptor morphology, the culture of human nociceptors (either from surgical or post-mortem tissue or using human induced pluripotent stem cell derived nociceptors), the application of high throughput technologies such as transcriptomics, the in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological characterization through microneurography, and the correlation with pain percepts provided by quantitative sensory testing. Genome editing in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived nociceptors enables the interrogation of the causal role of genes in the regulation of nociceptor function. Both human and rodent nociceptors are more heterogeneous at a molecular level than previously appreciated, and while we find that there are broad similarities between human and rodent nociceptors there are also important differences involving ion channel function, expression, and cellular excitability. These technological advances have emphasized the maladaptive plastic changes occurring in human nociceptors following injury that contribute to chronic pain. Studying human nociceptors has revealed new therapeutic targets for the suppression of chronic pain and enhanced repair. Cellular models of human nociceptors have enabled the screening of small molecule and gene therapy approaches on nociceptor function, and in some cases have enabled correlation with clinical outcomes. Undoubtedly, challenges remain. Many of these techniques are difficult to implement at scale, current induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols do not generate the full diversity of nociceptor populations, and we still have a relatively poor understanding of inter-individual variation in nociceptors due to factors such as age, sex, or ethnicity. We hope our ability to directly investigate human nociceptors will not only aid our understanding of the fundamental neurobiology underlying acute and chronic pain but also help bridge the translational gap.","Ability;Adjusted Life Years;Affect;Animals;Biopsy;Blood-Brain Barrier;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Culture;Drug Development;Ethnic Groups;Gene Therapy;Genes;Genome Editing;Hope;Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Humans;In Vitro;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Injuries;Ion Channels;Microscopy, Confocal;Neurobiology;News;Nociceptors;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plastics;Population;Regulation;Rodentia;Role;Scales;Screening;Sex;Technology;Therapeutics;Tissues;Translating;Translational Research",Chronic Pain;Injuries;Pain,Brain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34931070,2022,Anthrax toxins regulate pain signaling and can deliver molecular cargoes into ANTXR2+ DRG sensory neurons.,"Bacterial products can act on neurons to alter signaling and function. In the present study, we found that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons are enriched for ANTXR2, the high-affinity receptor for anthrax toxins. Anthrax toxins are composed of protective antigen (PA), which binds to ANTXR2, and the protein cargoes edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). Intrathecal administration of edema toxin (ET (PA + EF)) targeted DRG neurons and induced analgesia in mice. ET inhibited mechanical and thermal sensation, and pain caused by formalin, carrageenan or nerve injury. Analgesia depended on ANTXR2 expressed by Nav1.8+ or Advillin+ neurons. ET modulated protein kinase A signaling in mouse sensory and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons, and attenuated spinal cord neurotransmission. We further engineered anthrax toxins to introduce exogenous protein cargoes, including botulinum toxin, into DRG neurons to silence pain. Our study highlights interactions between a bacterial toxin and nociceptors, which may lead to the development of new pain therapeutics.","Administration;Analgesia;Animals;Anthrax;Antigens;Bacillus anthracis;Bacterial Toxins;Botulinum Toxins;Carrageenan;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Edema;Formalin;Ganglia, Spinal;Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Injuries;Lead;Mice;Neurons;News;Nociceptors;Pain;Proteins;Receptors, Peptide;Sensation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;Synaptic Transmission;Therapeutics",Anthrax;Edema;Ganglion Cysts;Injuries;Pain,Nat Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35171654,2022,Spatial transcriptomics of dorsal root ganglia identifies molecular signatures of human nociceptors.,"Nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that detect damaging or potentially damaging stimuli and are found in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia. These neurons are critical for the generation of neuronal signals that ultimately create the perception of pain. Nociceptors are also primary targets for treating acute and chronic pain. Single-cell transcriptomics on mouse nociceptors has transformed our understanding of pain mechanisms. We sought to generate equivalent information for human nociceptors with the goal of identifying transcriptomic signatures of nociceptors, identifying species differences and potential drug targets. We used spatial transcriptomics to molecularly characterize transcriptomes of single DRG neurons from eight organ donors. We identified 12 clusters of human sensory neurons, 5 of which are C nociceptors, as well as 1 C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), 1 Aβ nociceptor, 2 Aδ, 2 Aβ, and 1 proprioceptor subtypes. By focusing on expression profiles for ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other pharmacological targets, we provided a rich map of potential drug targets in the human DRG with direct comparison to mouse sensory neuron transcriptomes. We also compared human DRG neuronal subtypes to nonhuman primates showing conserved patterns of gene expression among many cell types but divergence among specific nociceptor subsets. Last, we identified sex differences in human DRG subpopulation transcriptomes, including a marked increase in calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha (CALCA) expression in female pruritogen receptor-enriched nociceptors. This comprehensive spatial characterization of human nociceptors might open the door to development of better treatments for acute and chronic pain disorders.","Animals;Cells;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Generations;Goals;Humans;Ion Channels;Male;Map;Mechanoreceptors;Mice;Neurons;Nociceptors;Organ Donors;Pain;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Primates;Procalcitonin;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics;Transcriptome;Trigeminal Ganglion",Chronic Pain;Pain,Sci Transl Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35292377,2022,Electrophysiological Alterations Driving Pain-Associated Spontaneous Activity in Human Sensory Neuron Somata Parallel Alterations Described in Spontaneously Active Rodent Nociceptors.,"Neuropathic pain in rodents can be driven by ectopic spontaneous activity (SA) generated by sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The recent demonstration that SA in dissociated human DRG neurons is associated with reported neuropathic pain in patients enables a detailed comparison of pain-linked electrophysiological alterations driving SA in human DRG neurons to alterations that distinguish SA in nociceptors from SA in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in rodent neuropathy models. Analysis of recordings from dissociated somata of patient-derived DRG neurons showed that SA and corresponding pain in both sexes were significantly associated with the three functional electrophysiological alterations sufficient to generate SA in the absence of extrinsic depolarizing inputs. These include enhancement of depolarizing spontaneous fluctuations of membrane potential (DSFs), which were analyzed quantitatively for the first time in human DRG neurons. The functional alterations were indistinguishable from SA-driving alterations reported for nociceptors in rodent chronic pain models. Irregular, low-frequency DSFs in human DRG neurons closely resemble DSFs described in rodent nociceptors while differing substantially from the high-frequency sinusoidal oscillations described in rodent LTMRs. These findings suggest that conserved physiological mechanisms of SA in human nociceptor somata can drive neuropathic pain despite documented cellular differences between human and rodent DRG neurons. PERSPECTIVE: Electrophysiological alterations in human sensory neurons associated with patient-reported neuropathic pain include all three of the functional alterations that logically can promote spontaneous activity. The similarity of distinctively altered spontaneous depolarizations in human DRG neurons and rodent nociceptors suggests that spontaneously active human nociceptors can persistently promote neuropathic pain in patients.","Action Potentials;Animals;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drive;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Male;Mechanoreceptors;Membrane Potentials;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Patients;Rodentia;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex;Soma;Time",Chronic Pain;Neuralgia;Pain,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35304484,2022,Transcriptomic analysis of human sensory neurons in painful diabetic neuropathy reveals inflammation and neuronal loss.,"Pathological sensations caused by peripheral painful neuropathy occurring in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often described as 'sharp' and 'burning' and are commonly spontaneous in origin. Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic ""glove and stocking"" pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls. Transcriptome analyses identified 844 differentially expressed genes. We observed increases in levels of inflammation-associated transcripts from macrophages in DPN patients that may contribute to pain hypersensitivity and, conversely, there were frequent decreases in neuronally-related genes. The elevated inflammatory gene profile and the accompanying downregulation of multiple neuronal genes provide new insights into intraganglionic pathology and mechanisms causing neuropathic pain in DPN patients with T2DM.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Down-Regulation;Extremities;Foot;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genes;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Macrophages;NAD;Neuralgia;Neurons, Afferent;News;Pain;Pathologic Processes;Pathology;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regeneration;Sensation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Transcriptome","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases",Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35410677,2022,The Genesis of Pain in Osteoarthritis: Inflammation as a Mediator of Osteoarthritis Pain.,"Chronic pain is a substantial personal and societal burden worldwide. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and is increasing in prevalence in accordance with a global aging population. In addition to affecting patients' physical lives, chronic pain also adversely affects patients' mental wellbeing. However, there remain no pharmacologic interventions to slow down the progression of OA and pain-alleviating therapies are largely unsuccessful. The presence of low-level inflammation in OA has been recognized for many years as a major pathogenic driver of joint damage. Inflammatory mechanisms can occur locally in joint tissues, such as the synovium, within the sensory nervous system, as well as systemically, caused by modifiable and unmodifiable factors. Understanding how inflammation may contribute to, and modify pain in OA will be instrumental in identifying new druggable targets for analgesic therapies. In this narrative review, we discuss recent insights into inflammatory mechanisms in OA pain. We discuss how local inflammation in the joint can contribute to mechanical sensitization and to the structural neuroplasticity of joint nociceptors, through pro-inflammatory factors such as nerve growth factor, cytokines, and chemokines. We consider the role of synovitis, and the amplifying mechanisms of neuroimmune interactions. We then explore emerging evidence around the role of neuroinflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horn. Finally, we discuss how systemic inflammation associated with obesity may modify OA pain and suggest future research directions.","Affect;Aged;Aging;Analgesics;Chemokines;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Cytokines;Future;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Inflammation;Joints;Nerve Growth Factors;Nervous System;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neuronal Plasticity;News;Nociceptors;Obesity;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Patients;Population;Prevalence;Research;Review;Role;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Synovial Membrane;Synovitis;Therapeutics;Tissues",Chronic Pain;Inflammation;Obesity;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Synovitis,Clin Geriatr Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36223199,2022,Metabolites of Cannabigerol Generated by Human Cytochrome P450s Are Bioactive.,"The phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG) is the central biosynthetic precursor to many cannabinoids, including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Though the use of CBG has recently witnessed a widespread surge because of its beneficial health effects and lack of psychoactivity, its metabolism by human cytochrome P450s is largely unknown. Herein, we describe comprehensive in vitro and in vivo cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolic studies of CBG, ranging from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based primary metabolic site determination, synthetic validation, and kinetic behavior using targeted mass spectrometry. These investigations revealed that cyclo-CBG, a recently isolated phytocannabinoid, is the major metabolite that is rapidly formed by selected human cytochrome P450s (CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9). Additionally, in vivo studies with mice administered with CBG supported these studies, where cyclo-CBG is the major metabolite as well. Spectroscopic binding studies along with docking and modeling of the CBG molecule near the heme in the active site of P450s confirmed these observations, pointing at the preferred site selectivity of CBG metabolism at the prenyl chain over other positions. Importantly, we found out that CBG and its oxidized CBG metabolites reduced inflammation in BV2 microglial cells stimulated with LPS. Overall, combining enzymological studies, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis, we showcase that CBG is rapidly metabolized by human P450s to form oxidized metabolites that are bioactive.","Active Site;Animals;Behavior;CBG;Cannabidiol;Cannabinoids;Chromatography, Liquid;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Dronabinol;Form;Health;Heme;Humans;In Vitro;Inflammation;Kinetics;Mass Spectrometry;Metabolism;Mice;Microglia;Observation;Overall;Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Inflammation,Biochemistry,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

The objective of this manuscript is to describe the Wakȟáŋyeža (Little Holy One) intervention and evaluation protocol, that is designed to break cycles of intergenerational trauma, suicide, and substance use among Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux parents and their children. A randomized controlled trial with an embedded single-case experimental design will be used to determine effectiveness of the modular prevention intervention on parent-child outcomes and the added impact of unique cultural lesson-components. Participants include 1) Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux parents who have had adverse childhood experiences, and 2) their children (3-5 years). Parent-child dyads are randomized (1:1) to Little Holy One or a control group that consists of 12 lessons taught by Indigenous community health workers. Lessons were developed from elements of 1) the Common Elements Treatment Approach and Family Spirit, both evidence-based interventions, and 2) newly created cultural (intervention) and nutrition (control group only) lessons. Primary outcomes are parent (primary caregiver) trauma symptoms and stress. Secondary outcomes include: Parent depression symptoms, parenting practices, parental control, family routines, substance use, historical loss, communal mastery, tribal identity, historical trauma. Child outcomes include, externalizing and internalizing behavior and school attendance. Primary analysis will follow an intent-to-treat approach, and secondary analysis will include examination of change trajectories to determine impact of cultural lessons and exploration of overall effect moderation by age and gender of child and type of caregiver (e.g., parent, grandparent). Many Native American parents have endured adverse childhood experiences and traumas that can negatively impact capacity for positive parenting. Study results will provide insights about the potential of a culturally-based intervention to reduce parental distress - an upstream approach to reducing risk for childrens' later substance misuse and suicidality. Intervention design features, including use of community health workers, cultural grounding, and administration in Head Start settings lend potential for feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, and scalability.

35189881,2022,"A trend analysis of the prevalence of opioid misuse, social support, and suicide attempt among American Indian/Alaska native high school students in New Mexico: 2009-2019 Youth Risk Resiliency Survey (YRRS).","American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth face stark inequities in opioid misuse, social support, and suicide attempt. This study examined trends in these behavioral measures among AI/AN students in New Mexico (NM). Using the NM oversampled Youth Resiliency and Risk Survey (NM-YRRS, 2009 - 2019: odd years), prevalence estimates of opioid misuse, social support (SS), and suicide attempt for AI/AN high school students were generated. Trends over time were assessed via linear regression of weighted proportions according to Peter Armitage. Stratified trends by demographics were also employed. While the prevalence of suicide attempt did not change significantly over time, it was consistently higher among females (2011-2019), those who misused opioids, received low social support, had a mother with less than high school education, had a C, D, or F for academic performance, and non-straight students relative to their counterparts. In particular, the prevalence of suicide attempt among AI/AN students who reported opioid misuse in 2009 was significantly higher by 25.4% than their counterparts who did not report opioid misuse (35.8% vs. 10.4%.) A significant decreasing trend over time (2009-2017) was observed for opioid misuse (16.1%↓8.8%, p-value = 0.0033), including when stratifying by sex (males: 15.9%↓9%, p-value = 0.002; females: 16.2%↓8.6%, p-value = 0.012). Youth with high maternal education exhibited significant decline in opioid misuse (13.5%↓6.7%, p-value = 0.019; 2011-2017.) Opioid misuse increased significantly from 2017 to 2019 (8.8%↑12.9%, p-value &lt; 0.0001.) For instance, in 2019 among AI/AN students who reported low social support, opioid misuse was roughly doubled (18.9% vs. 8.5%, p &lt; 0.0001), and suicide attempt was tripled (21.3% vs. 7.0%, p &lt; 0.0001) compared to students with high social support. No significant trend was observed for suicide attempt. We observed a significant decreasing trend in opioid misuse between 2009 through 2017 but a significant increase from 2017 to 2019. A higher level of maternal education (college or above), and an A or B school grade performance were protective against both opioid misuse and suicide attempt.","Academic Performance;Adolescent;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Demography;Education;Face;Female;Humans;Indians, North American;Linear Regression;Male;Measures;Mothers;New Mexico;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Prevalence;Relatives;Report;Risk;Schools;Sex;Social Support;Students;Suicide;Suicide, Attempted;Surveys;Time;Youth",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,BMC Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35382787,2022,The mediation and moderation effect of social support on the relationship between opioid misuse and suicide attempts among native American youth in New Mexico: 2009-2019 Youth Risk Resiliency Survey (NM-YRRS).,"Suicide attempt and opioid misuse continue to be major behavioral health challenges among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The aim of the study is to evaluate the mediating and moderating role that social support (SS) plays in their association among AI/AN high-school students in New Mexico (NM). An aggregated NM Youth Resiliency and Risk Survey (NM-YRRS, 2009-2019: odd years) dataset was used. Multivariable logistic regression modeling and mediation analysis were conducted while adjusting for confounding variables. Overall, 12.0 and 14.0% of AI/AN students reported opioid misuse and suicide attempt, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of suicide attempt in students with high SS relative to low SS who misused opioids was 0.43 (p-value = 0.007). The effect of high SS relative to low SS among males who misused opioids was more pronounced (AOR = 0.24, p-value &lt; 0.0001) compared to females (AOR = 0.43, p-value = 0.007). Relative to low SS, high SS was protective for suicide attempt among AI/AN students who misused opioids and attended school in off-reservation (AOR = 0.42, p-value = 0.012) communities, rural communities (AOR = 0.44, p = 0.040), and in communities that are both rural and off-reservation (AOR = 0.39, p = 0.035). Overall, 23.64, and 41.05% of the association between opioid misuse, and suicide attempt was mediated and moderated by SS, respectively. The mediation effect of SS was lowest for rural, on-reservation schools. More resources need to be allocated to rural on-reservation schools to enhance social support. The study highlights key insights into the significant role SS plays in promoting health and mitigating the association between opioid misuse and suicide attempt.","Adolescent;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Association;Community;Confounding Variables;Dataset;Female;Health;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Mediating;Mediation Analysis;Needs;Negotiating;New Mexico;Odds Ratio;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Play;Relatives;Resources;Risk;Role;Rural Communities;Schools;Social Support;Students;Suicide;Suicide, Attempted;Surveys;Youth",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,BMC Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34565444,2021,Integrating traditional practices and social network visualization to prevent substance use: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial among urban Native American emerging adults.,"Nonmedical use of prescription opioids (defined as taking opioid medications for hedonic effects or in a manner other than prescribed) and the use of heroin have emerged in recent years as major public health concerns in the United States. Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults (ages 18-25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging adults. In a randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year old urban AI/AN emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n = 185), which comprises three virtual workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally sensitive opioid education workshop (n = 185). We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of frequency of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use, as well as secondary outcomes of social network characteristics and cultural connectedness, over a 12-month period. This project has the potential to expand the range and effectiveness of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis services for urban AI/AN emerging adults by addressing the opioid epidemic and use of other substances at both the community and individual level. In addition, it provides important culturally grounded conceptual and practical information to advance the field of substance use interventions and enhance resiliency among this population.

35118610,2022,Risk and Resilience Among Families in Urban AI/AN Communities: the Role of Young Adults.,"Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) young adults and their families are often geographically or socially distant from tribal networks and traditional social support. Young adults can be especially vulnerable to cultural and social disconnection, so understanding how AI/AN family functioning can augment resilience and protect against risk is important. This research precedes a preventive substance use intervention study and explores urban Native family functioning, emphasizing the role of young adults by analyzing data from 13 focus groups with urban AI/AN young adults (n = 32), parents (n = 25), and health providers (n = 33).

The study team conducted this study to develop Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA), a new opioid prevention intervention for urban AI/AN emerging adults ages 18-25. TACUNA comprises three 2-hour virtual workshops. We conducted thirteen focus groups in three urban communities in northern, central, and southern California (six with urban AI/AN emerging adults ages 18-25 [n = 32], four with parents [n = 26], and three with providers [n = 33]) to identify relevant intervention domains. We then incorporated the results of a rapid analysis of the focus groups to develop intervention workshops followed by a pilot test (n = 15) to further refine the intervention and assess feasibility. Four major domains emerged from focus groups: 1) historical trauma/cultural identity, 2) AI/AN traditional practices, 3) social networks, and 4) substance use. We incorporated all feedback relating to each theme to enhance content of the TACUNA intervention. Pilot test participants felt that TACUNA content was interesting, addressed their issues and concerns as urban AI/AN emerging adults, and believed that the program could help them to establish cultural and social connections to live healthier lives. Research activities demonstrate how a community-informed and culturally grounded opioid prevention intervention can be developed for urban AI/AN emerging adults. Addressing issues and challenges with culturally and developmentally relevant intervention content can help to build resilience and hopefully decrease opioid use among this underserved population.","Adolescent;Adult;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Analgesics, Opioid;California;Community;Feedback;Focus Groups;Historical Trauma;Humans;Indians, North American;News;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Parents;Persons;Pilots;Populations, Underserved;Program;Research Activities;Social Networks;Substance Use;Workshops;Young Adult",Historical Trauma;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35756141,2022,"Cultural Dynamics, Substance Use, and Resilience Among American Indian/Alaska Native Emerging Adults in Urban Areas.","Identity development during emerging adulthood helps lay down the structure of values, social bonds, and decision-making patterns that help determine adult outcomes, including patterns of substance use. Managing cultural identity may pose unique challenges for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) emerging adults in ""urban"" areas (away from tribal lands or reservations), who are relatively isolated from social and cultural connections. This isolation is in turn a product of cultural genocide and oppression, both historically and in the present day. This paper uses qualitative data from 13 focus groups with urban AI/AN emerging adults, parents, and providers to explore how cultural dynamics are related to substance use outcomes for urban AI/AN emerging adults. We found that cultural isolation as well as ongoing discrimination presents challenges to negotiating cultural identity, and that the AI/AN social and cultural context sometimes presented risk exposures and pathways for substance use. However, we also found that culture provided a source of strength and resilience for urban AI/AN emerging adults, and that specific cultural values and traditions - such as mindfulness, connection to nature, and a deep historical and cosmological perspective - offer ""binding pathways"" for positive behavioral health. We conclude with two suggestions for substance use prevention and intervention for this population: (1) incorporate these ""binding pathways"" for health and resilience explicitly into intervention materials; (2) emphasize and celebrate emerging adulthood itself as a sacred cultural transition.

36180896,2022,Feasibility and acceptability of incorporating social network visualizations into a culturally centered motivational network intervention to prevent substance use among urban Native American emerging adults: a qualitative study.,"Coupling social network visualizations with Motivational Interviewing in substance use interventions has been shown to be acceptable and feasible in several pilot tests, and has been associated with changes in participants' substance use and social networks. The objective of this study was to assess acceptability and feasibility of an adaptation of this behavior change approach into a culturally centered behavior change intervention for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) emerging adults living in urban areas. AI/AN populations experience high rates of health disparities and substance use. Although 70% of AI/AN people live outside of tribal lands, there are few culturally tailored health interventions for these AI/AN populations. Social networks can both increase and discourage substance use. Leveraging healthy social networks and increasing protective factors among urban AI/AN emerging adults may help increase resilience. We conducted thirteen focus groups with 91 male and female participants (32 urban AI/AN emerging adults ages 18-25, 26 parents, and 33 providers) and one pilot test of the three workshop sessions with 15 AI/AN emerging adults. Focus group participants provided feedback on a proposed workshop-based intervention curriculum that combined group Motivational Interviewing (MI) and social network visualizations. Pilot workshop participants viewed their own social networks during group MI sessions focused on substance use and traditional practices and discussed their reactions to viewing and discussing their networks during these sessions. We used a combination of open coding of focus group and workshop session transcripts to identify themes across the group sessions and content analysis of comments entered into an online social network interview platform to assess the extent that participants had an intuitive understanding of the information conveyed through network diagrams. Focus group and pilot test participants reacted positively to the intervention content and approach and provided constructive feedback on components that should be changed. Themes that emerged included feasibility, acceptability, relevance, understandability, and usefulness of viewing personal network visualizations and discussing social networks during group MI workshops. Workshop participants demonstrated an intuitive understanding of network concepts (network composition and structure) when viewing their diagrams for the first time. Social network visualizations are a promising tool for increasing awareness of social challenges and sources of resilience for urban AI/AN emerging adults. Coupled with Motivational Interviewing in a group context, social network visualizations may enhance discussions of network influences on substance use and engagement in traditional practices.

28315125,2018,Evidence of Non-Linear Associations between Frustration-Related Prefrontal Cortex Activation and the Normal:Abnormal Spectrum of Irritability in Young Children.,"Burgeoning interest in early childhood irritability has recently turned toward neuroimaging techniques to better understand normal versus abnormal irritability using dimensional methods. Current accounts largely assume a linear relationship between poor frustration management, an expression of irritability, and its underlying neural circuitry. However, the relationship between these constructs may not be linear (i.e., operate differently at varying points across the irritability spectrum), with implications for how early atypical irritability is identified and treated. Our goal was to examine how the association between frustration-related lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) activation and irritability differs across the dimensional spectrum of irritability by testing for non-linear associations. Children (N = 92; ages 3-7) ranging from virtually no irritability to the upper end of the clinical range completed a frustration induction task while we recorded LPFC hemoglobin levels using fNIRS. Children self-rated their emotions during the task and parents rated their child's level of irritability. Whereas a linear model showed no relationship between frustration-related LPFC activation and irritability, a quadratic model revealed frustration-related LPFC activation increased as parent-reported irritability scores increased within the normative range of irritability but decreased with increasing irritability in the severe range, with an apex at the 91st percentile. Complementarily, we found children's self-ratings of emotion during frustration related to concurrent LPFC activation as an inverted U function, such that children who reported mild distress had greater activation than peers reporting no or high distress. Results suggest children with relatively higher irritability who are unimpaired may possess well-developed LPFC support, a mechanism that drops out in the severe end of the irritability dimension. Findings suggest novel avenues for understanding the heterogeneity of early irritability and its clinical sequelae.","Association;Child;Child, Preschool;Comprehension;Emotional Regulation;Emotions;Female;Frustration;Functional Neuroimaging;Goals;Hemoglobins;Humans;Irritable Mood;Linear Models;Male;Methods;Neuroimaging;Parents;Prefrontal Cortex;Self;Self Report;Self-Control;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,J Abnorm Child Psychol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
28525629,2018,The Association of Perceived Memory Loss with Osteoarthritis and Related Joint Pain in a Large Appalachian Population.,"Previous studies have documented memory impairment in several chronic pain syndromes. However, the potential link between memory loss and osteoarthritis (OA), the second most common cause of chronic pain, remains little explored. In this cross-sectional study, we examine the association of perceived memory loss to OA and assess the potential mediating influence of sleep and mood disturbance in a large Appalachian population. Cross-sectional. US Ohio Valley. A total of 21,982 Appalachian adults age 40 years or older drawn from the C8 Health Project (N = 19,004 adults without and 2,478 adults with OA). All participants completed a comprehensive health survey between 2005 and 2006. Medical history, including physician diagnosis of OA, lifestyle factors, short- and long-term memory loss, sleep quality, and mood were assessed via self-report. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, health-related, and other factors, participants with OA were almost three times as likely to report frequent memory loss (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] for short- and long-term memory loss, respectively = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-3.3, and 2.6, 95% CI = 2.0-3.3). The magnitude of these associations increased significantly with rising frequency of reported joint pain (adjusted OR for OA with frequent joint pain vs no OA = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.6-4.1, Ptrend &lt; 0.00001). Including measures of mood and sleep impairment attenuated but did not eliminate these associations (ORs for any memory loss = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6-2.4, and 2.1, 95% CI = 1.7-2.8, adjusted for sleep and mood impairment, respectively; OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4-2.2, adjusted for both factors). In this large cross-sectional study, OA and related joint pain were strongly associated with perceived memory loss; these associations may be partially mediated by sleep and mood disturbance.","Adjustment;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Appalachian Region;Arthralgia;Association;Chronic Pain;Confidence Intervals;Cross-Sectional Studies;Demography;Diagnosis;Female;Health;Health Surveys;History;Humans;Life Style;Lifestyle Factors;Male;Measures;Mediating;Memory;Memory Disorders;Memory Loss;Memory, Long-Term;Middle Aged;Mood;Odds Ratio;Ohio;Osteoarthritis;Perception;Physicians;Population;Population Surveillance;Report;Self Report;Sleep;Syndrome;Time",Arthralgia;Chronic Pain;Memory Disorders;Memory Loss;Osteoarthritis;Syndrome,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
28594744,2018,Probability of Opioid Prescription Refilling After Surgery: Does Initial Prescription Dose Matter?,"We sought to determine the correlation between the probability of postoperative opioid prescription refills and the amount of opioid prescribed, hypothesizing that a greater initial prescription yields a lower probability of refill. Although current guidelines regarding opioid prescribing largely address chronic opioid use, little is known regarding best practices and postoperative care. We analyzed Optum Insight claims data from 2013 to 2014 for opioid-naïve patients aged 18 to 64 years who underwent major or minor surgical procedures (N = 26,520). Our primary outcome was the occurrence of an opioid refill within 30 postoperative days. Our primary explanatory variable was the total oral morphine equivalents provided in the initial postoperative prescription. We used logistic regression to examine the probability of an additional refill by initial prescription strength, adjusting for patient factors. We observed that 8.67% of opioid-naïve patients refilled their prescriptions. Across procedures, the probability of a single postoperative refill did not change with an increase with initial oral morphine equivalents prescribed. Instead, patient factors were correlated with the probability of refill, including tobacco use [odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.57], anxiety (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.15-1.47), mood disorders (OR 1.28. 95% CI 1.13-1.44), alcohol or substance abuse disorders (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12-1.84), and arthritis (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34). The probability of refilling prescription opioids after surgery was not correlated with initial prescription strength, suggesting surgeons could prescribe smaller prescriptions without influencing refill requests. Future research that examines the interplay between pain, substance abuse, and mental health could inform strategies to tailor opioid prescribing for patients.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Arthritis;Best Practices;Confidence Intervals;Drug Prescriptions;Female;Future;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Minor Surgical Procedures;Mood Disorders;Morphine;Multivariate Analysis;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Postoperative Care;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Probability;Procedures;Research;Substance Abuse;Surgeons;Tobacco Use;Young Adult","Arthritis;Mood Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Substance Abuse",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
28901776,2018,Liposomal Delivery of Diacylglycerol Lipase-Beta Inhibitors to Macrophages Dramatically Enhances Selectivity and Efficacy in Vivo.,"Diacylglycerol lipase-beta (DAGLβ) hydrolyzes arachidonic acid (AA)-containing diacylglycerols to produce bioactive lipids including endocannabinoids and AA-derived eicosanoids involved in regulation of inflammatory signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that DAGLβ inactivation using the triazole urea inhibitor KT109 blocked macrophage inflammatory signaling and reversed allodynic responses of mice in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Here, we tested whether we could exploit the phagocytic capacity of macrophages to localize delivery of DAGLβ inhibitors to these cells in vivo using liposome encapsulated KT109. We used DAGLβ-tailored activity-based probes and chemical proteomic methods to measure potency and selectivity of liposomal KT109 in macrophages and tissues from treated mice. Surprisingly, delivery of ∼5 μg of liposomal KT109 was sufficient to achieve ∼80% inactivation of DAGLβ in macrophages with no apparent activity in other tissues in vivo. Our macrophage-targeted delivery resulted in a &gt;100-fold enhancement in antinociceptive potency compared with free compound in a mouse inflammatory pain model. Our studies describe a novel anti-inflammatory strategy that is achieved by targeted in vivo delivery of DAGLβ inhibitors to macrophages.","Analgesics;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Arachidonic Acids;Behavior, Animal;Cells;Chronic Pain;Diglycerides;Disease Models, Animal;Eicosanoids;Endocannabinoids;Enzyme Inhibitors;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Lipids;Lipopolysaccharides;Lipoprotein Lipase;Liposomes;Macrophages;Male;Measures;Methods;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neuralgia;Pain;Phagocytosis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prostaglandins;Proteins;Proteomics;Regulation;Tissues;Treatment Outcome;Triazoles;Urea",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Pain,Mol Pharm,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29077871,2018,From Mechanism to Cure: Renewing the Goal to Eliminate the Disease of Pain.,"Persistent pain causes untold misery worldwide and is a leading cause of disability. Despite its astonishing prevalence, pain is undertreated, at least in part because existing therapeutics are ineffective or cause intolerable side effects. In this review, we cover new findings about the neurobiology of pain and argue that all but the most transient forms of pain needed to avoid tissue damage should be approached as a disease where a cure can be the goal of all treatment plans, even if attaining this goal is not yet always possible. We reviewed the literature to highlight recent advances in the area of the neurobiology of pain. We discuss barriers that are currently hindering the achievement of this goal, as well as the development of new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss innovations in the field that are creating new opportunities to treat and even reverse persistent pain, some of which are in late-phase clinical trials. We conclude that the confluence of new basic science discoveries and development of new technologies are creating a path toward pain therapeutics that should offer significant hope of a cure for patients and practitioners alike.

29108734,2018,Altered anterior cingulate cortex to hippocampus effective connectivity in response to drug cues in men with cocaine use disorder.,"Drug-related attentional bias may have significant implications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CocUD). However, the neurobiology of attentional bias is not completely understood. This study employed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to conduct an analysis of effective (directional) connectivity involved in drug-related attentional bias in treatment-seeking CocUD subjects. The DCM analysis was conducted based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from fifteen CocUD subjects while performing a cocaine-word Stroop task, during which blocks of Cocaine Words (CW) and Neutral Words (NW) alternated. There was no significant attentional bias at group level. Although no significant brain activation was found, the DCM analysis found that, relative to the NW, the CW caused a significant increase in the strength of the right (R) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to R hippocampus effective connectivity. Greater increase of this connectivity was associated with greater CW reaction time (relative to NW reaction time). The increased strength of R ACC to R hippocampus connectivity may reflect ACC activation of hippocampal memories related to drug use, which was triggered by the drug cues. This circuit could be a potential target for therapeutics in CocUD patients. No significant change was found in the other modeled connectivities.",Adult;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Attentional Bias;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cocaine;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Cognition;Cues;Female;Gyrus Cinguli;Hippocampus;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Memory;Men;Middle Aged;Nerve Net;Neurobiology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Photic Stimulation;Random Allocation;Reaction Time;Relatives;Stroop Test;Therapeutics;fMRI,Cocaine-Related Disorders,Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
29249459,2018,Translational Control Mechanisms in Persistent Pain.,"Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world's population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain. In this review, we highlight recent advances in translational regulation of gene expression in nociceptive circuits, with a focus on key signaling pathways and mRNA targets that may be tractable for the creation of next-generation pain therapeutics.","Animals;Chronic Pain;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Humans;Injuries;Maintenance;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Population;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Proteome;RNA, Messenger;Regulation;Review;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics;Tissues;Work",Chronic Pain;Injuries;Pain,Trends Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29473258,2018,Treating women with opioid use disorder during pregnancy in Appalachia: Initial neonatal outcomes following buprenorphine + naloxone exposure.,"Rising concerns regarding diversion and misuse of mono-buprenorphine for treatment of pregnant women with opioid use disorders have sparked interest in the use of buprenorphine + naloxone to reduce misuse and diversion rates. Examined the relationship of prenatal buprenorphine + naloxone exposure to neonatal outcomes. This is a retrospective chart review of 26 mother infant dyads in comprehensive medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine + naloxone during pregnancy. All neonatal birth outcome parameters were within normal ranges, albeit on the lower side of normal for gestational age and birth weight. Only 19% of neonates required morphine pharmacology for NAS. Use of buprenorphine + naloxone shows relative safety in pregnancy. These findings can help better guide prescribing practices for pregnant patients at risk for misuse or diversion of buprenorphine.

29540562,2018,Monoacylglycerol Lipase Inhibitors Reverse Paclitaxel-Induced Nociceptive Behavior and Proinflammatory Markers in a Mouse Model of Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy.,"Although paclitaxel effectively treats various cancers, its debilitating peripheral neuropathic pain side effects often persist long after treatment has ended. Therefore, a compelling need exists for the identification of novel pharmacologic strategies to mitigate this condition. As inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary hydrolytic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid, 2-arachidonyolglycerol, produces antinociceptive effects in numerous rodent models of pain, we investigated whether inhibitors of this enzyme (i.e., JZL184 and MJN110) would reverse paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. These drugs dose dependently reversed allodynia with respective ED50 values (95% confidence limit) of 8.4 (5.2-13.6) and 1.8 (1.0-3.3) mg/kg. Complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches revealed that the antiallodynic effects of each drug require both cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2 MJN110 reduced paclitaxel-mediated increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) and phospho-p38 MAPK in dorsal root ganglia as well as MCP-1 in spinal dorsal horn. Whereas the antinociceptive effects of high dose JZL184 (40 mg/kg) underwent tolerance following 6 days of repeated dosing, repeated administration of a threshold dose (i.e., 4 mg/kg) completely reversed paclitaxel-induced allodynia. In addition, we found that the administration of MJN110 to control mice lacked intrinsic rewarding effects in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. However, it produced a CPP in paclitaxel-treated animals, suggesting a reduced paclitaxel-induced aversive state. Importantly, JZL184 did not alter the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of paclitaxel in A549 and H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Taken together, these data indicate that MAGL inhibitors reverse paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain without interfering with chemotherapeutic efficacy.","Administration;Aftercare;Allodynia;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Apoptosis;Behavior;Benzodioxoles;Biomarkers;Cancer;Cannabinoids;Carbamates;Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Chemokine CCL2;Disease Models, Animal;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Therapy;Enzyme Inhibitors;Enzymes;Ganglia, Spinal;Genetics;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Monoacylglycerol Lipases;Needs;Neuralgia;Nociception;Paclitaxel;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphoproteins;Piperidines;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2;Rodentia;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Succinimides;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Allodynia;Cancer;Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Neoplasms;Neuralgia;Pain",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29590553,2018,Targeting pain at its source in sickle cell disease.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder associated with hemolytic anemia, end-organ damage, reduced survival, and pain. One of the unique features of SCD is recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vasoocclusive crisis requiring hospitalization. Additionally, patients with SCD often develop chronic persistent pain. Currently, sickle cell pain is treated with opioids, an approach limited by adverse effects. Because pain can start at infancy and continue throughout life, preventing the genesis of pain may be relatively better than treating the pain once it has been evoked. Therefore, we provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sickle cell pain that contribute to the activation of the somatosensory system in the peripheral and central nervous systems. These mechanisms include mast cell activation and neurogenic inflammation, peripheral nociceptor sensitization, maladaptation of spinal signals, central sensitization, and modulation of neural circuits in the brain. In this review, we describe potential preventive/therapeutic targets and their targeting with novel pharmacologic and/or integrative approaches to ameliorate sickle cell pain.","Acute Pain;Analgesia;Analgesics;Anemia, Hemolytic;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Brain;Cells;Central Nervous System;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Hereditary Diseases;Hospitalization;Humans;Life;Mast Cells;Molecular Targeted Therapy;Neurogenic Inflammation;Nociceptors;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Perception;Pain Threshold;Patients;Review;Risk Factors;Signal Transduction;Substance P;Survival;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome","Acute Pain;Anemia, Hemolytic;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hereditary Diseases;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain",Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
29601219,2018,An examination of the perceived impact of a continuing interprofessional education experience on opiate prescribing practices.,"Chronic pain is increasingly recognized as a public health problem. We assessed the effectiveness of a multi-modal, interprofessional educational approach aimed at empowering healthcare professionals to make deliberative changes, especially in opiate prescribing practices. Education activities included enduring webcasts, regional interprofessional roundtable events, and state-level conference presentations within targeted Kentucky and West Virginia regions of the United States. Over 1,000 participants accessed the various activities. For the live events, the largest groups reached included nurses (38.1%), nurse practitioners (31.2%), and physicians (22.1%). In addition to our reach, higher levels of educational effectiveness were measured, specifically, learner's intentions to change practice patterns, confidence in meeting patient's needs, and knowledge of pain management guidelines. The majority of the conference (58%) and roundtable (69%) participants stated they intend to make a practice change in one or more areas of chronic pain patient management in post-event evaluation. Differences in pre- and post-activity responses on the measures of confidence and knowledge, with additional comparison to a control population who were not in attendance, were analyzed using non-parametric tests of significance. While neither activity produced significant changes in confidence from pre-activity, participants were more confident post-activity than their control group peers. There were significant changes in knowledge for both live event and webcast participants. Impactful chronic pain continuing the education that emphasizes collaborative care is greatly needed; these results show that the approaches taken here can impact learner's knowledge and confidence, and hold potential for creating change in how opioid prescribing is managed.","Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude of Health Personnel;Chronic Pain;Clinical Competence;Conferences;Control Groups;Curriculum;Education;Education, Medical, Continuing;Guideline;Health Care;Humans;Intention;Interprofessional Education;Kentucky;Knowledge;Learning;Measures;Needs;Nurse Practitioners;Nurses;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Pain Management;Patients;Physicians;Population Control;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Program;Public Health;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;Webcast;West Virginia",Chronic Pain;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Interprof Care,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29623639,2018,Pharmacogenetics of Opioid Use Disorder Treatment.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant health problem in the United States and many other countries. A combination of issues, most notably increased prescription of opioid analgesics, has resulted in climbing rates of opioid abuse and overdose over the last decade. This ongoing epidemic has produced a growing population of patients requiring treatment for OUD. Medications such as methadone and buprenorphine have well documented success rates in treating the disorder compared with placebo. However, significant percentages of the population still fail to maintain abstinence or reduce illicit opioid use while using such medications. Genetic variation may play a role in this variability in outcome through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects on OUD medications, or by affecting the rate of negative side effects and adverse events. This review focuses on the existing literature on the pharmacogenetics of OUD treatment, with specific focus on medication metabolism, treatment outcomes, and adverse events.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Epidemics;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Variation;Health;Humans;Literature;Metabolism;Methadone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Variants;Pharmacokinetics;Placebos;Play;Population;Prescriptions;Review;Role;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States",Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,CNS Drugs,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29637436,2018,Opioid Prescribing After Curative-Intent Surgery: A Qualitative Study Using the Theoretical Domains Framework.,"Excessive opioid prescribing is common after curative-intent surgery, but little is known about what factors influence prescribing behaviors among surgeons. To identify targets for intervention, we performed a qualitative study of opioid prescribing after curative-intent surgery using the Theoretical Domains Framework, a well-established implementation science method for identifying factors influencing healthcare provider behavior. Prior to data collection, we constructed a semi-structured interview guide to explore decision making for opioid prescribing. We then conducted interviews with surgical oncology providers at a single comprehensive cancer center. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, then independently coded by two investigators using the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify theoretical domains relevant to opioid prescribing. Relevant domains were then linked to behavior models to select targeted interventions likely to improve opioid prescribing. Twenty-one subjects were interviewed from November 2016 to May 2017, including attending surgeons, resident surgeons, physician assistants, and nurses. Five theoretical domains emerged as relevant to opioid prescribing: environmental context and resources; social influences; beliefs about consequences; social/professional role and identity; and goals. Using these domains, three interventions were identified as likely to change opioid prescribing behavior: (1) enablement (deploy nurses during preoperative visits to counsel patients on opioid use); (2) environmental restructuring (provide on-screen prompts with normative data on the quantity of opioid prescribed); and (3) education (provide prescribing guidelines). Key determinants of opioid prescribing behavior after curative-intent surgery include environmental and social factors. Interventions targeting these factors are likely to improve opioid prescribing in surgical oncology.","Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude of Health Personnel;Behavior;Beliefs;Cancer;Clinical Competence;Data Collection;Decision Making;Drug Prescriptions;Education;Elective Surgical Procedures;Female;General Surgery;Goals;Guideline;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Health Personnel;Humans;Implementation Science;Intention;Interview;Male;Methods;Models, Theoretical;Nurses;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Physician Assistants;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Professional Role;Qualitative Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Social Factors;Surgeons;Surgical Oncology","Cancer;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg Oncol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29718951,2018,The Complementary Health Approaches for Pain Survey (CHAPS): Validity testing and characteristics of a rural population with pain.,"Little is known about patterns and correlates of Complementary Health Approaches (CHAs) in chronic pain populations, particularly in rural, underserved communities. This article details the development and implementation of a new survey instrument designed to address this gap, the Complementary Health Approaches for Pain Survey (CHAPS). Following pilot-testing using pre-specified criteria to assess quality and comprehension in our target population, and after feedback regarding face-validity from content experts and stakeholders, the final cross-sectional self-report survey required 10-12 minutes to complete. It contained 69 demographic, lifestyle and health-related factors, and utilized a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) underpinning to assess short- and long-term use of 12 CHAs for pain management. Twenty additional items on pain severity, feelings, clinical outcomes, and activities were assessed using the Short-Form Global Pain Scale (SF-GPS); Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Investigators conducted consecutive sampling in four West Virginia pain management and rheumatology practices. 301 Appalachian adult patients seeking conventional care for pain management. Response rates were high (88% ± 4.1%). High quality and comprehension deemed the CHAPS an appropriate measurement tool in a rural population with pain. Missing data were unrelated to patient characteristics. Participants predominantly experienced chronic pain (93%), had five or more health conditions (56%, Mean = 5.4±3.1), were white (92%), female (57%), and middle-aged (Mean = 55.6 (SD = 13.6) years). Over 40% were disabled (43%) and/or obese (44%, Mean BMI = 33.4±31.5). Additionally, 44% used opioids, 31% used other prescription medications, and 66% used at least one CHA for pain, with 48% using CHAs for greater than 6 months. There was high internal reliability of the SF-GPS (alpha = .93) and satisfactory internal reliability for each of the five TTM stages across (all) twelve CHAs: precontemplation (0.89), contemplation (0.72), preparation (0.75), action (0.70), and maintenance (0.70). The CHAPS is the first comprehensive measurement tool to assess CHA use specifically for pain management.

29733454,2018,Severe pain during wound care procedures: A cross-sectional study protocol.,"The aim of this study is to: (a) develop and evaluate a model to predict severe pain during wound care procedures (WCPs) so that high-risk patients can be targeted for specialized dressings and preventive pain control; and (b) identify biological factors associated with severe pain during WCPs so that novel pain control strategies can be developed. Wound care procedures such as dressing changes can cause moderate to severe pain in 74% of patients, with nearly half (36%) of all patients experiencing severe pain (rated as 8-10 on a 10-point numeric rating scale) during dressing change. Additionally, clinicians have little direction with current guidelines regarding pain control during WCPs including the selection of the appropriate advanced wound dressings and the appropriate use of analgesics. This is a cross-sectional study. The National Institute of Nursing Research approved and funded the study June of 2015 and the appropriate Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols prior to funding. Study enrolment is underway at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with a target of 525 participants. Potential participants must be adults (21+ years) and have a nonburn, nondiabetic foot, full-thickness wound. The research team performs a one-time study dressing change on enrolled participants and collects all study data.

29848111,2019,Protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) activation causes migraine-like pain behaviors in mice.,"Pain is the most debilitating symptom of migraine. The cause of migraine pain likely requires activation of meningeal nociceptors. Mast cell degranulation, with subsequent meningeal nociceptor activation, has been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Degranulating mast cells release serine proteases that can cleave and activate protease activated receptors. The purpose of these studies was to investigate whether protease activated receptor 2 is a potential generator of nociceptive input from the meninges by using selective pharmacological agents and knockout mice. Ratiometric Ca++ imaging was performed on primary trigeminal and dural cell cultures after application of 2at-LIGRL-NH2, a specific protease activated receptor 2 agonist. Cutaneous hypersensitivity and facial grimace was measured in wild-type and protease activated receptor 2-/- mice after dural application of 2at-LIGRL-NH2 or compound 48-80, a mast cell degranulator. Behavioral experiments were also conducted in mice after dural application of 2at-LIGRL-NH2 (2AT) in the presence of either C391, a selective protease activated receptor 2 antagonist, or sumatriptan. 2at-LIGRL-NH2 evoked Ca2+ signaling in mouse trigeminal neurons, dural fibroblasts and in meningeal afferents. Dural application of 2at-LIGRL-NH2 or 48-80 caused dose-dependent grimace behavior and mechanical allodynia that were attenuated by either local or systemic application of C391 as well as in protease activated receptor 2-/- mice. Nociceptive behavior after dural injection of 2at-LIGRL-NH2 was also attenuated by sumatriptan. Functional protease activated receptor 2 receptors are expressed on both dural afferents and fibroblasts and activation of dural protease activated receptor 2 produces migraine-like behavioral responses. Protease activated receptor 2 may link resident immune cells to meningeal nociceptor activation, driving migraine-like pain and implicating protease activated receptor 2 as a therapeutic target for migraine in humans.","Animals;Behavior;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Degranulation;Cells;Compound 48-80;Fibroblasts;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Injections;Male;Mast Cells;Mechanical Allodynia;Meninges;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Inbred ICR;Mice, Knockout;Migraine Disorders;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Receptor, PAR-2;Receptors, Proteinase-Activated;Serine Proteases;Sumatriptan;Therapeutics;Trigeminal Nerve",Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Migraine Disorders;Pain,Cephalalgia,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Enhancing the effects of SMT requires an understanding of underlying mechanisms and a systematic approach to leverage understanding of mechanisms to create more effective treatment protocols that are scalable in clinical practice. Prior work has identified effects on spinal stiffness and lumbar multifidus activation as possible mechanisms. This project represents a refinement phase study within the context of a multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. Our goal is to identify an optimized SMT treatment protocol by examining the impact of using co-intervention exercise strategies that are proposed to accentuate SMT mechanisms. The optimized protocol can then be evaluated in confirmation phase clinical trials and implementation studies. A phased, factorial randomized trial design will be used to evaluate the effects of three intervention components provided in eight combinations on mechanistic (spinal stiffness and multifidus muscle activation) and patient-reported outcomes (pain and disability). All participants will receive two sessions then will be randomly assigned to receive six additional sessions (or no additional treatment) over the next three weeks with factorial combinations of additional SMT and exercise co-interventions (spine mobilizing and multifidus activating). Outcome assessments occur at baseline, and one week, four weeks, and three months after enrollment. Pre-specified analyses will evaluate main effects for treatment components as well as interaction effects. Building on preliminary findings identifying possible mechanisms of effects for SMT, this trial represents the next phase in a multiphase strategy towards the ultimate goal of developing an optimized protocol for providing SMT to patients with LBP. If successful, the results of this trial can be tested in future clinical trials in an effort to produce larger treatment benefits and improve patient-centered outcomes for individuals with LBP.

29945931,2018,Differential Tolerance to FTY720-Induced Antinociception in Acute Thermal and Nerve Injury Mouse Pain Models: Role of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor Adaptation.,"The immunomodulatory prodrug 2-amino-2-(2-[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-propanediol (FTY720), which acts as an agonist for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors (S1PR) when phosphorylated, is proposed as a novel pain therapeutic. In this study, we assessed FTY720-mediated antinociception in the radiant heat tail-flick test and in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. FTY720 produced antinociception and antiallodynia, respectively, and these effects were dose-dependent and mimicked by the S1PR1-selective agonist CYM-5442. Repeated administration of FTY720 for 1 week produced tolerance to acute thermal antinociception, but not to antiallodynia in the CCI model. S1PR-stimulated [35S]GTPγS autoradiography revealed apparent desensitization of G protein activation by S1P or the S1PR1 agonist 5-[4-phenyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-thienyl]-3-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (SEW-2871) throughout the brain. Similar results were seen in spinal cord membranes, whereby the Emax value of S1PR-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was greatly reduced in repeated FTY720-treated mice. These results suggest that S1PR1 is a primary target of FTY720 in alleviating both acute thermal nociception and chronic neuropathic nociception. Furthermore, the finding that tolerance develops to antinociception in the tail-flick test but not in chronic neuropathic pain suggests a differential mechanism of FTY720 action between these models. The observation that repeated FTY720 administration led to desensitized S1PR1 signaling throughout the central nervous system suggests the possibility that S1PR1 activation drives the acute thermal antinociceptive effects, whereas S1PR1 desensitization mediates the following: 1) tolerance to thermal antinociceptive actions of FTY720 and 2) the persistent antiallodynic effects of FTY720 in neuropathic pain by producing functional antagonism of pronociceptive S1PR1 signaling.","Administration;Animals;Autoradiography;Brain;Central Nervous System;Constriction;Disease Models, Animal;Drive;FTY-720;Fingolimod Hydrochloride;GTP-Binding Proteins;Heat;Injuries;Male;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Inbred ICR;Neuralgia;Nociception;Observation;Opioid Peptides;Oxadiazoles;Pain;Phosphates;Prodrugs;Propylene Glycols;Receptors, Lysosphingolipid;Role;Sphingosine;Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors;Spinal Cord;Tail;Temperature;Therapeutics",Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
29948809,2018,Transitions of Care for Postoperative Opioid Prescribing in Previously Opioid-Naïve Patients in the USA: a Retrospective Review.,"New persistent opioid use is a common postoperative complication, with 6% of previously opioid-naïve patients continuing to fill opioid prescriptions 3-6 months after surgery. Despite these risks, it is unknown which specialties prescribe opioids to these vulnerable patients. To identify specialties prescribing opioids to surgical patients who develop new persistent opioid use. Using a national dataset of insurance claims, we identified opioid-naïve patients aged 18-64 years undergoing surgical procedures (2008-2014) who continued filling opioid prescriptions 3 to 6 months after surgery. We then examined opioid prescriptions claims during the 12 months after surgery, and identified prescribing physician specialty using National Provider Identifier codes. Percentage of opioid prescriptions provided by each specialty evaluated at 90-day intervals during the 12 months after surgery. We identified 5276 opioid-naïve patients who developed new persistent opioid use. During the first 3 months after surgery, surgeons accounted for 69% of opioid prescriptions, primary care physicians accounted for 13%, Emergency Medicine accounted for 2%, Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R)/Pain Medicine accounted for 1%, and all other specialties accounted for 15%. In contrast, 9 to 12 months after surgery, surgeons accounted for only 11% of opioid prescriptions, primary care physicians accounted for 53%, Emergency Medicine accounted for 5%, PM&amp;R/Pain Medicine accounted for 6%, and all other specialties provided 25%. Among surgical patients who developed new persistent opioid use, surgeons provide the majority of opioid prescriptions during the first 3 months after surgery. By 9 to 12 months after surgery, however, the majority of opioid prescriptions were provided by primary care physicians. Enhanced care coordination between surgeons and primary care physicians could allow earlier identification of patients at risk for new persistent opioid use to prevent misuse and dependence.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Comorbidity;Dataset;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Prescriptions;Emergency Medicine;Female;General Surgery;Health Services Research;Humans;Insurance;Male;Medicine;Middle Aged;News;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Outcome Assessment;Patient Transition;Patients;Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Postoperative Care;Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Review;Risk;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative;United States;Young Adult","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications",J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30021714,2018,Toward Increasing Engagement in Substance Use Data Collection: Development of the Substance Abuse Research Assistant App and Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial Using Adolescents and Emerging Adults.,"Substance use is an alarming public health issue associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Adolescents and emerging adults are at particularly high risk because substance use typically initiates and peaks during this developmental period. Mobile health apps are a promising data collection and intervention delivery tool for substance-using youth as most teens and young adults own a mobile phone. However, engagement with data collection for most mobile health applications is low, and often, large fractions of users stop providing data after a week of use. Substance Abuse Research Assistant (SARA) is a mobile application to increase or sustain engagement of substance data collection overtime. SARA provides a variety of engagement strategies to incentivize data collection: a virtual aquarium in the app grows with fish and aquatic resources; occasionally, funny or inspirational contents (eg, memes or text messages) are provided to generate positive emotions. We plan to assess the efficacy of SARA's engagement strategies over time by conducting a micro-randomized trial, where the engagement strategies will be sequentially manipulated. We aim to recruit participants (aged 14-24 years), who report any binge drinking or marijuana use in the past month. Participants are instructed to use SARA for 1 month. During this period, participants are asked to complete one survey and two active tasks every day between 6 pm and midnight. Through the survey, we assess participants' daily mood, stress levels, loneliness, and hopefulness, while through the active tasks, we measure reaction time and spatial memory. To incentivize and support the data collection, a variety of engagement strategies are used. First, predata collection strategies include the following: (1) at 4 pm, a push notification may be issued with an inspirational message from a contemporary celebrity; or (2) at 6 pm, a push notification may be issued reminding about data collection and incentives. Second, postdata collection strategies include various rewards such as points which can be used to grow a virtual aquarium with fishes and other treasures and modest monetary rewards (up to US $12; US $1 for each 3-day streak); also, participants may receive funny or inspirational content as memes or gifs or visualizations of prior data. During the study, the participants will be randomized every day to receive different engagement strategies. In the primary analysis, we will assess whether issuing 4 pm push-notifications or memes or gifs, respectively, increases self-reporting on the current or the following day. The microrandomized trial started on August 21, 2017 and the trial ended on February 28, 2018. Seventy-three participants were recruited. Data analysis is currently underway. To the best of our knowledge, SARA is the first mobile phone app that systematically manipulates engagement strategies in order to identify the best sequence of strategies that keep participants engaged in data collection. Once the optimal strategies to collect data are identified, future versions of SARA will use this data to provide just-in-time adaptive interventions to reduce substance use among youth.

30048311,2020,Patterns of Initial Opioid Prescribing to Opioid-Naive Patients.,"To determine the proportion of initial opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients prescribed by surgeons, dentists, and emergency physicians. We hypothesized that the percentage of such prescriptions grew as scrutiny of primary care and pain medicine opioid prescribing increased and guidelines were developed. Data regarding the types of care for which opioid-naive patients are provided initial opioid prescriptions are limited. A retrospective cross-sectional study using a nationwide insurance claims dataset to study US adults aged 18 to 64 years. Our primary outcome was a change in opioid prescription share for opioid-naive patients undergoing surgical, emergency, and dental care from 2010 to 2016; we also examined the type and amounts of opioid filled. From 87,941,718 analyzed lives, we identified 16,292,018 opioid prescriptions filled by opioid-naive patients. The proportion of prescriptions for patients receiving surgery, emergency, and dental care increased by 15.8% from 2010 to 2016 (P &lt; 0.001), with the greatest increases related to surgical (18.1%) and dental (67.8%) prescribing. In 2016, surgery patients filled 22.0% of initial prescriptions, emergency medicine patients 13.0%, and dental patients 4.2%. Surgical patients' mean total oral morphine equivalents per prescription increased from 240 mg (SD 509) in 2010 to 403 mg (SD 1369) in 2016 (P &lt; 0.001). Over the study period, surgical patients received the highest proportion of potent opioids (90.2% received hydrocodone or oxycodone). Initial opioid prescribing attributable to surgical and dental care is increasing relative to primary and chronic pain care. Evidence-based guideline development for surgical and dental prescribing is warranted in order to curb iatrogenic opioid morbidity and mortality.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dataset;Dental Care;Dentists;Emergencies;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Hydrocodone;Insurance;Male;Medicine;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Morphine;Mortality;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain;Patients;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Dentists';Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Relatives;Retrospective Studies;Surgeons;United States",Chronic Pain;Pain,Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30056059,2018,Spillover Effect of Evidence-Based Postoperative Opioid Prescribing.,"Opioid prescribing after operations is often excessive, resulting in leftover pills in the community available for diversion. Procedure-specific postoperative prescribing guidelines can reduce excessive prescribing, however, it is unclear whether such guidelines are associated with reductions in opioid prescribing for other procedures. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, and thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy between January 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017. Postoperative opioid prescription size (in oral morphine equivalents [OME]) was compared before and after November 1, 2016, when prescribing guidelines were introduced for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in opioid prescribing after this intervention. A total of 1,158 patients were included in the cohort (558 pre-intervention, 600 post-intervention). Opioid prescription size was significantly reduced for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (447.6 ± 74.3 OME vs 291.9 ± 104.3 OME; p &lt; 0.001), laparoscopic appendectomy (173.7 ± 101.6 OME vs 85.8 ± 52.7 OME; p &lt; 0.001), laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (185.0 ± 101.8 OME vs 107.9 ± 57.9 OME; p &lt; 0.001), and thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy (81.5 ± 52.8 OME vs 42.6 ± 22.5 OME; p &lt; 0.001). Interrupted time series analysis revealed that this reduction was attributable to intervention for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (-24.5 ± 5.3 OME; p = 0.001), laparoscopic appendectomy (-50.2 ± 28.7 OME; p = 0.04), and thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy (-28.8 ± 9.4 OME; p = 0.001). For laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, the immediate decrease in prescription size was not statistically significant (-38.8 ± 33.1 OME; p = 0.24). There was a significant increase in requests for refills after laparoscopic appendectomy (0.8% vs 6.6%; p = 0.01) but not for other procedures. After implementing evidence-based opioid prescribing recommendations for a single surgical procedure, opioid prescribing decreased for 4 other surgical procedures. Requests for refills did not increase substantially. This spillover effect demonstrates the potential impact of raising awareness about safe and appropriate opioid prescribing after operations.","Analgesics, Opioid;Appendectomy;Awareness;Chart;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Community;Evidence-Based Medicine;Female;Gastrectomy;Guideline;Hernia, Inguinal;Herniorrhaphy;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Laparoscopy;Male;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Pain, Postoperative;Parathyroidectomy;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Retrospective Studies;Review;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Thyroidectomy;Treatment Outcome","Hernia, Inguinal;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",J Am Coll Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30118972,2019,A review of opioid addiction genetics.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) affects millions of people worldwide and the risk of developing the disorder has a significant genetic component according to twin and family studies. Identification of the genetic variants underlying this inherited risk has focused on two different methods: candidate gene studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The most studied candidate genes have included the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1), the delta-opioid receptor (OPRD1), the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Variants in these genes have been associated with relatively small, but reproducible, effects on OUD risk. More recently, GWAS have identified potential associations with variants in KCNG2, KCNC1, CNIH3, APBB2, and RGMA. In total the genetic associations identified so far explain only a small portion of OUD risk. GWAS of OUD is still in the early stages when compared to studies of other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, which have found many relevant variants with small effect sizes only after large meta-analyses. Substantial increases in cohort sizes will likely be necessary in the OUD field to achieve similar results. In addition, it will be important for future studies of OUD to incorporate rare variants, epigenetics, and gene × environment interactions into models in order to better explain the observed heritability.","Affect;Association;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Epigenetics;Family;Future;Gene-Environment Interaction;Genes;Genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Mental Disorders;Methods;Multifactorial Inheritance;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Receptors, Dopamine D2;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Review;Risk;Schizophrenia;Twins",Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Schizophrenia,Curr Opin Psychol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30140896,2018,Association of Hydrocodone Schedule Change With Opioid Prescriptions Following Surgery.,"In 2014, the US Drug Enforcement Administration moved hydrocodone-containing analgesics from schedule III to the more restrictive schedule II to limit prescribing and decrease nonmedical opioid use. The association of this policy change with postoperative prescribing is not well understood. To examine the hypothesis that the amount of opioids prescribed following surgery is associated with the rescheduling of hydrocodone. An interrupted time series analysis of outpatient opioid prescriptions was conducted to examine the trends in the amount of postoperative opioids filled before and after the schedule change. Opioid prescriptions filled between January 2012 and October 2015 were analyzed using insurance claims data from the Michigan Value Collaborative, which includes data from 75 hospitals across Michigan. A total of 21 955 adult inpatients 18 to 64 years of age who underwent 1 of 19 common elective surgical procedures and filled an opioid prescription within 14 days of discharge to home were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the trends in the mean amount of opioids filled in oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) for the initial postoperative prescriptions before and after the schedule change date of October 6, 2014, compared using interrupted time series and multivariable regression analyses. Secondary outcomes included the total amount of opioids filled and the refill rate for the 30-day postoperative period. Subgroup analyses were performed by hydrocodone prescriptions, nonhydrocodone prescriptions, surgical procedure, and prior opioid use. Data from 21 955 patients undergoing surgical procedures across 75 hospitals and 5120 prescribers were analyzed. Cohorts before and after the schedule change were equivalent with respect to sex (10 197 of 15 791 [64.6%] vs 3966 of 6169 [64.3%] female; P = .69) and mean (SE) age (47.9 [11.2] vs 47.7 [11.3] years; P = .19). After the schedule change, the mean OMEs filled in the initial opioid prescription increased by approximately 35 OMEs (β = 35.1 [13.2]; P &lt; .01), equivalent to 7 tablets of hydrocodone (5 mg). There were no significant differences in the total OMEs filled during the 30-day postoperative period before and after the schedule change (β = 18.3 [30.5]; P = .55), but there was a significant decrease in the refill rate (β = -5.2% [1.3%]; P &lt; .001). Changing hydrocodone from schedule III to schedule II was associated with an increase in the amount of opioids filled in the initial prescription following surgery. Opioid-related policies require close follow-up to identify and address early unintended effects given the multitude of competing factors that influence health care professional prescribing behaviors.","Address;Administration;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Behavior;Dates;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Prescriptions;Elective Surgical Procedures;Female;General Surgery;Health Care Professionals;Hospitals;Humans;Hydrocodone;Inpatients;Insurance;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Postoperative Period;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Diversion;Prescriptions;Regression Analysis;Respect;Retrospective Studies;Schedules;Sex;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Tablets;Young Adult","Pain, Postoperative",JAMA Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30188515,2018,PET imaging reveals lower kappa opioid receptor availability in alcoholics but no effect of age.,"Opioid receptors are implicated in alcoholism, other addictions, withdrawal, and depression, and are considered potential pharmacological targets for treatment. Our goal in the present study was to compare the availability of kappa opioid receptors (KOR) between an alcohol-dependent cohort (AD) and a healthy control cohort (HC). Sixty-four participants-36 AD and 28 HC-underwent PET scans with [11C]LY2795050, a selective kappa antagonist tracer. Partial-volume correction was applied to all PET data to correct for atrophy. Volume of distribution (VT) of the tracer was estimated regionally as a measure of KOR availability. VT values of AD versus HC were compared for 15 defined ROIs. Multivariate analysis showed a main effect of group on VT across these 15 ROIs. Post hoc tests showed that AD had significantly lower VT and thus a lower KOR availability than HC in amygdala and pallidum (corrected for multiple comparisons). Exploratory analysis of change in VT with age was conducted; VT was not found to vary significantly with age in any region. Our findings of lower VT in AD versus HC in multiple regions are in contrast to findings in the mu and delta opioid receptor systems of higher VT in AD versus HC. Although age-related decline in receptors has previously been observed in the mu opioid receptor system, we found that KOR availability does not change with age.","Adult;Age Factors;Alcoholics;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Amygdala;Atrophy;Benzamides;Brain;Carbon Radioisotopes;Cohort Studies;Depression;Female;Globus Pallidus;Goals;Humans;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Pets;Positron-Emission Tomography;Pyrrolidines;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Alcoholism;Atrophy,Neuropsychopharmacology,,Like,
30238243,2019,The Impact of Education and Prescribing Guidelines on Opioid Prescribing for Breast and Melanoma Procedures.,"Excessive opioid prescribing is common in surgical oncology, with 72% of prescribed opioids going unused after curative-intent surgery. In this study, we sought to reduce opioid prescribing after breast and melanoma procedures by designing and implementing an intervention focused on education and prescribing guidelines, and then evaluating the impact of this intervention. In this single-institution study, we designed and implemented an intervention targeting key factors identified in qualitative interviews. This included mandatory education for prescribers, evidence-based prescribing guidelines, and standardized patient instructions. After the intervention, interrupted time-series analysis was used to compare the mean quantity of opioid prescribed before and after the intervention (July 2016-September 2017). We also evaluated the frequency of opioid prescription refills. During the study, 847 patients underwent breast or melanoma procedures and received an opioid prescription. For mastectomy or wide local excision for melanoma, the mean quantity of opioid prescribed immediately decreased by 37% after the intervention (p = 0.03), equivalent to 13 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg. For lumpectomy or breast biopsy, the mean quantity of opioid prescribed decreased by 42%, or 12 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg (p = 0.07). Furthermore, opioid prescription refills did not significantly change for mastectomy/wide local excision (13% vs. 14%, p = 0.8), or lumpectomy/breast biopsy (4% vs. 5%, p = 0.7). Education and prescribing guidelines reduced opioid prescribing for breast and melanoma procedures without increasing the need for refills. This suggests further reductions in opioid prescribing may be possible, and provides rationale for implementing similar interventions for other procedures and practice settings.","Analgesics, Opioid;Biopsy;Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Cohort Studies;Drug Prescriptions;Education;Female;Follow-Up Studies;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Inappropriate Prescribing;Instruction;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Interview;Lumpectomy;Mastectomy;Melanoma;Needs;Oncologists;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Prognosis;Surgical Oncology;Tablets","Breast Neoplasms;Melanoma;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg Oncol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30247321,2020,Provider Characteristics Associated With Outpatient Opioid Prescribing After Surgery.,"To characterize differences in postoperative opioid prescribing across surgical, nonsurgical, and advanced practice providers. There is a critical need to identify best practices around perioperative opioid prescribing. To date, differences in postoperative prescribing among providers are poorly understood. This is a retrospective multicenter analysis of commercial insurance claims from a statewide quality collaborative. We identified 15,657 opioid-naïve patients who underwent a range of surgical procedures between January 2012 and October 2015 and filled an opioid prescription within 30 days postoperatively. Our primary outcome was total amount of opioid filled per prescription within 30 days postoperatively [in oral morphine equivalents (OME)]. Hierarchical linear regression was used to determine the association between provider characteristics [specialty, advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) vs. physician, and gender] and outcome while adjusting for patient factors. Average postoperative opioid prescription amount was 326 ± 285 OME (equivalent: 65 tablets of 5 mg hydrocodone). Advanced practice providers accounted for 19% of all prescriptions, and amount per prescription was 18% larger in this group compared with physicians (315 vs. 268, P &lt; 0.001). Primary care providers accounted for 13% of all prescriptions and prescribed on average 279 OME per prescription. The amount of opioid prescribed varied by surgical specialty and ranged from 178 OME (urology) to 454 OME (neurosurgery). Advanced practice providers account for 1-in-5 postoperative opioid prescriptions and prescribe larger amounts per prescription relative to surgeons. Engaging all providers involved in postoperative care is necessary to understand prescribing practices, identify barriers to reducing prescribing, and tailor interventions accordingly.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Best Practices;Dates;Female;Gender;General Surgery;Humans;Hydrocodone;Insurance;Linear Regression;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Morphine;Needs;Neurosurgery;Nurse Practitioners;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Physician Assistants;Physicians;Postoperative Care;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Relatives;Retrospective Studies;Specialties, Surgical;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Tablets;Urology","Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30287893,2019,Capturing the statewide incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome in real time: the West Virginia experience.,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is one of the consequences at birth affecting the newborn after discontinuation of prenatal drug exposure to mainly opioids. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of the problem in the state of West Virginia (WV) using a real-time statewide surveillance system. Project WATCH is a surveillance tool that since 1998 collects data on all infants born in the state of WV. NAS surveillance item was added to the tool in October 2016. This study examined all births (N = 23,667) in WV from October to December 2017. The data from six WV birthing facilities were audited for 1 month to evaluate how well this tool was capturing NAS data using κ-statistics. The 2017 annual incidence rate of NAS was 51.3 per 1000 live births per year for all births and 50.6 per 1000 live births per year for WV residents only. The κ-coefficient between the hospital medical records and Project WATCH data was 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.82) for NAS.

30316852,2019,Factors Associated With New Persistent Opioid Usage After Lung Resection.,"Opioid dependence, misuse, and abuse in the United States continue to rise. Prior studies indicate an important risk factor for persistent opioid use includes elective surgical procedures, though the probability following thoracic procedures remains unknown. We analyzed the incidence and factors associated with new persistent opioid use after lung resection. We evaluated data from opioid-naïve cancer patients undergoing lung resection between 2010 and 2014 using insurance claims from the Truven Health MarketScan Databases. New persistent opioid usage was defined as continued opioid prescription fills between 90 and 180 days following surgery. Variables with a p value less than 0.10 by univariate analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression performed for risk adjustment. Multivariable results were each reported with odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI). A total of 3,026 patients (44.8% men, 55.2% women) were identified as opioid-naïve undergoing lung resection. Mean age was 64 ± 11 years and mean postoperative length of stay was 5.2 ± 3.3 days. A total of 6.5% underwent neoadjuvant therapy, while 21.7% underwent adjuvant therapy. Among opioid-naïve patients, 14% continued to fill opioid prescriptions following lung resection. Multivariable analysis showed that age less than or equal to 64 years (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.59; p = 0.028), male sex (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.73; p = 0.002), postoperative length of stay (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.65; p = 0.016), thoracotomy (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.02; p &lt; 0.001), and adjuvant therapy (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.75 to 2.75; p &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for persistent opioid usage. The greatest risk factors for persistent opioid use (14%) following lung resection were adjuvant therapy and thoracotomy. Future studies should focus on reducing excess prescribing, perioperative patient education, and safe opioid disposal.","Analgesics, Opioid;Cancer;Confidence Intervals;Database;Databases, Factual;Elective Surgical Procedures;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Future;General Surgery;Health;Humans;Incidence;Insurance;Length of Stay;Logistic Regression;Lung;Male;Men;Middle Aged;Neoadjuvant Therapy;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Pneumonectomy;Prescriptions;Probability;Procedures;Prognosis;Retrospective Studies;Risk Adjustment;Risk Factors;Sex;Therapeutics;Thoracotomy;United States;Women","Cancer;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Thorac Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30368433,2018,Feasibility and Acceptability of Mobile Phone-Based Auto-Personalized Physical Activity Recommendations for Chronic Pain Self-Management: Pilot Study on Adults.,"Chronic pain is a globally prevalent condition. It is closely linked with psychological well-being, and it is often concomitant with anxiety, negative affect, and in some cases even depressive disorders. In the case of musculoskeletal chronic pain, frequent physical activity is beneficial. However, reluctance to engage in physical activity is common due to negative psychological associations (eg, fear) between movement and pain. It is known that encouragement, self-efficacy, and positive beliefs are effective to bolster physical activity. However, given that the majority of time is spent away from personnel who can give such encouragement, there is a great need for an automated ubiquitous solution. MyBehaviorCBP is a mobile phone app that uses machine learning on sensor-based and self-reported physical activity data to find routine behaviors and automatically generate physical activity recommendations that are similar to existing behaviors. Since the recommendations are based on routine behavior, they are likely to be perceived as familiar and therefore likely to be actualized even in the presence of negative beliefs. In this paper, we report the preliminary efficacy of MyBehaviorCBP based on a pilot trial on individuals with chronic back pain. A 5-week pilot study was conducted on people with chronic back pain (N=10). After a week long baseline period with no recommendations, participants received generic recommendations from an expert for 2 weeks, which served as the control condition. Then, in the next 2 weeks, MyBehaviorCBP recommendations were issued. An exit survey was conducted to compare acceptance toward the different forms of recommendations and map out future improvement opportunities. In all, 90% (9/10) of participants felt positive about trying the MyBehaviorCBP recommendations, and no participant found the recommendations unhelpful. Several significant differences were observed in other outcome measures. Participants found MyBehaviorCBP recommendations easier to adopt compared to the control (βint=0.42, P&lt;.001) on a 5-point Likert scale. The MyBehaviorCBP recommendations were actualized more (βint=0.46, P&lt;.001) with an increase in approximately 5 minutes of further walking per day (βint=4.9 minutes, P=.02) compared to the control. For future improvement opportunities, participants wanted push notifications and adaptation for weather, pain level, or weekend/weekday. In the pilot study, MyBehaviorCBP's automated approach was found to have positive effects. Specifically, the recommendations were actualized more, and perceived to be easier to follow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an automated approach has achieved preliminary success to promote physical activity in a chronic pain context. Further studies are needed to examine MyBehaviorCBP's efficacy on a larger cohort and over a longer period of time.",Adult;Affect;Anxiety;Association;Back Pain;Behavior;Beliefs;Cell Phone;Chronic Pain;Depressive Disorder;Exercise;Fear;Feasibility Studies;Female;Form;Future;Humans;Knowledge;Learning;Machine Learning;Male;Map;Mobile Phone;Movement;Needs;Occupational Groups;Outcome Measures;Pain;Paper;Persons;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Report;Scales;Self;Self Efficacy;Self-Management;Solutions;Surveys;Time;Walking;Weather,Back Pain;Chronic Pain;Depressive Disorder;Pain,J Med Internet Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30422239,2019,Association of Opioid Prescribing With Opioid Consumption After Surgery in Michigan.,"There is growing evidence that opioids are overprescribed following surgery. Improving prescribing requires understanding factors associated with opioid consumption. To describe opioid prescribing and consumption for a variety of surgical procedures and determine factors associated with opioid consumption after surgery. A retrospective, population-based analysis of the quantity of opioids prescribed and patient-reported opioid consumption across 33 health systems in Michigan, using a sample of adults 18 years and older undergoing surgery. Patients were included if they were prescribed an opioid after surgery. Surgical procedures took place between January 1, 2017, and September 30, 2017, and were included if they were performed in at least 25 patients. Opioid prescription size in the initial postoperative prescription. Patient-reported opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate risk-adjusted opioid consumption with robust standard errors. In this study, 2392 patients (mean age, 55 years; 1353 women [57%]) underwent 1 of 12 surgical procedures. Overall, the quantity of opioid prescribed was significantly higher than patient-reported opioid consumption (median, 30 pills; IQR, 27-45 pills of hydrocodone/acetaminophen, 5/325 mg, vs 9 pills; IQR, 1-25 pills; P &lt; .001). The quantity of opioid prescribed had the strongest association with patient-reported opioid consumption, with patients using 0.53 more pills (95% CI, 0.40-0.65; P &lt; .001) for every additional pill prescribed. Patient-reported pain in the week after surgery was also significantly associated with consumption but not as strongly as prescription size. Compared with patients reporting no pain, patients used a mean (SD) 9 (1) more pills if they reported moderate pain and 16 (2) more pills if they reported severe pain (P &lt; .001). Other significant risk factors included history of tobacco use, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, age, procedure type, and inpatient surgery status. After adjusting for these risk factors, patients in the lowest quintile of opioid prescribing had significantly lower mean (SD) opioid consumption compared with those in the highest quintile (5 [2] pills vs 37 [3] pills; P &lt; .001). The quantity of opioid prescribed is associated with higher patient-reported opioid consumption. Using patient-reported opioid consumption to develop better prescribing practices is an important step in combating the opioid epidemic.","Acetaminophen;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Anesthesiologists;Association;Comprehension;Consumption;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Health;History;Humans;Hydrocodone;Inpatients;Linear Regression;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcome Measures;Patients;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Prospective Studies;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Societies;Standards;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Tobacco Use;Treatment Outcome;Unnecessary Procedures;Women","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",JAMA Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30497812,2019,A statewide comparison of opioid prescribing in teaching versus nonteaching hospitals.,"Postoperative opioid prescribing is often excessive, but the differences in opioid prescribing between teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals is not well understood. Given the workload of surgical training and frequent turnover of prescribers on surgical services, we hypothesized that postoperative opioid prescribing would be higher among teaching compared with nonteaching hospitals. We used insurance claims from a statewide quality collaborative in Michigan to identify 17,075 opioid-naïve patients who underwent 22 surgical procedures across 76 hospitals from 2012 to 2016. Our outcomes included the following: (1) the amount of opioid prescribed for the initial postoperative prescription in oral morphine equivalents and (2) high-risk prescribing in the 30 days after surgery (high daily dose [≥ 100 oral morphine equivalents], new long-acting/extended-release opioid, overlapping prescriptions, or concurrent benzodiazepine prescription). Teaching hospital status was obtained from the 2014 American Hospital Association survey. Multilevel regression was used to adjust for patient and procedural factors and to perform reliability adjustment. The amount of opioid prescribed per initial opioid prescription varied 4.7-fold across all hospitals from 130 oral morphine equivalents to 616 oral morphine equivalents. Patients discharged from teaching hospitals filled larger initial opioid prescriptions overall compared with nonteaching hospitals (251 oral morphine equivalents versus 232 oral morphine equivalents; P = .026). Teaching hospitals had higher risk-adjusted rates of high-risk prescribing compared with nonteaching hospitals (13.7% vs 10.3%; P = .034). In Michigan, surgical patients discharged from teaching hospitals received significantly larger postoperative opioid prescriptions and had higher rates of high-risk prescribing compared with nonteaching hospitals. All hospitals, and particularly teaching institutions, should ensure that adequate resources are devoted to facilitating safe postoperative opioid prescribing.","Adjustment;Adult;American Hospital Association;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Hospitals;Hospitals, Teaching;Humans;Insurance;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Morphine;News;Opioids;Overall;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Prescriptions;Resources;Risk;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Surveys;Teaching;Workload","Pain, Postoperative",Surgery,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

We used data from the West Virginia University Medicine health care system to examine the trend in opioid overdoses and percentage of patients with a repeat overdose from 2008 to 2016. We obtained the opioid overdose death rate for the state from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) mortality data for 2008 to 2016. The hospitalization rate for opioid overdoses increased (13%) on average each year in a similar fashion to the opioid overdose death rate for the state (12%) between 2008 and 2016. During the same time, the percentage of patients with a repeat opioid overdose increased annually by 13% on average. There continues to be a surge of opioid overdoses in West Virginia. These findings suggest a need to amplify comprehensive prevention and treatment efforts throughout the state. Public health initiatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with overdoses should consider how the changes in potency may be influencing these outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Health Care Systems;Hospitalization;Humans;Indicators;Medicine;Morbidity;Mortality;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Public Health;Research;Retrospective Studies;Therapeutics;Time;Universities;West Virginia",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Am J Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30601256,2020,Classifying Preoperative Opioid Use for Surgical Care.,"We characterized patterns of preoperative opioid use in patients undergoing elective surgery to identify the relationship between preoperative use and subsequent opioid fill after surgery. Preoperative opioid use is common, and varies by dose, recency, duration, and continuity of fills. To date, there is little evidence to guide postoperative prescribing need based on prior opioid use. We analyzed claims data from Clinformatics DataMart Database for patients aged 18 to 64 years undergoing major and minor surgery between 2008 and 2015. Preoperative use was defined as any opioid prescription filled in the year before surgery. We used cluster analysis to group patients by the dose, recency, duration, and continuity of use. Our primary outcome was second postoperative fill within 30 postoperative days. Our primary explanatory variable was opioid use group. We used logistic regression to examine likelihood of second fill by opioid use group. Out of 267,252 patients, 102,748 (38%) filled an opioid prescription in the 12 months before surgery. Cluster analysis yielded 6 groups of preoperative opioid use, ranging from minimal (27.6%) to intermittent (7.7%) to chronic use (2.7%). Preoperative opioid use was the most influential predictor of second fill, with larger effect sizes than other factors even for patients with minimal or intermittent opioid use. Increasing preoperative use was associated with risk-adjusted likelihood of requiring a second opioid fill compared with naive patients [minimal use: odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.45-1.53; recent intermittent use: OR 6.51, 95% CI 6.16-6.88; high chronic use: OR 60.79, 95% CI 27.81-132.92, all P values &lt;0.001). Preoperative opioid use is common among patients who undergo elective surgery. Although the majority of patients infrequently fill opioids before surgery, even minimal use increases the probability of needing additional postoperative prescriptions in the 30 days after surgery when compared with opioid-naive patients. Going forward, identifying preoperative opioid use can inform surgeon prescribing and care coordination for pain management after surgery.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Cluster Analysis;Confidence Intervals;Data Mart;Database;Dates;Female;General Surgery;Humans;Incidence;Influentials;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Minor Surgical Procedures;Needs;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Preoperative Period;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Probability;Risk;Risk Factors;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative;United States;Young Adult","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30658219,2019,Fentanyl and fentanyl-analog involvement in drug-related deaths.,"To describe and analyze the involvement of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (FAs) in drug-related deaths in West Virginia (WV), United States. Retrospective analyses of all WV drug-related deaths from 2005 to 2017 were performed, including comparisons of demographic and toxicological characteristics among total deaths, deaths in which fentanyl/FAs were present, deaths in which they were absent, heroin-related deaths, and prescription opioid-related deaths. Most of the 8813 drug-related deaths were overdoses, with about 11% resulting from transportation/other injuries in which drugs were contributors. Prescription opioid presence (without fentanyl) decreased by 75% from 2005-14 to 2015-17 (3545 deaths to 859 deaths, respectively), while fentanyl involvement in the deaths increased by 122% between these periods (487 to 1082 deaths). Ten FAs were identified (427 instances) after 2015. Alprazolam and ethanol were among the top five most frequently identified substances across years. Fentanyl, heroin and cocaine replaced oxycodone, diazepam and hydrocodone in the top five beginning in 2015. Few decedents had a prescription for fentanyl after 2015, with fewer prescriptions also present for other controlled substances identified. Fentanyl, rapidly emerging FAs, and other illicit drugs in recent years pose a serious health threat even though prescription opioid-related deaths decreased over the same time period.","Adult;Alprazolam;Analgesics, Opioid;Cocaine;Controlled Substances;Databases, Factual;Death;Demography;Diazepam;Drug Overdose;Ethanol;Female;Fentanyl;Health;Heroin;Humans;Hydrocodone;Illicit Drugs;Injuries;Male;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Time;Transportation;United States;West Virginia",Death;Drug Overdose;Injuries,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30688044,2019,Association of Geography and Access to Health Care Providers With Long-Term Prescription Opioid Use in Medicare Patients With Severe Osteoarthritis: A Cohort Study.,"To evaluate the variation in long-term opioid use in osteoarthritis (OA) patients according to geography and health care access. We designed an observational cohort study among OA patients undergoing total joint replacement (TJR) in the Medicare program (2010 through 2014). The independent variables of interest were the state of residence and health care access, which was quantified at the primary care service area (PCSA) level as categories of number of practicing primary care providers (PCPs) and categories of rheumatologists per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The percentage of OA patients taking long-term opioids (≥90 days in the 360-day period immediately preceding TJR) within each PCSA was the outcome variable in a multilevel, generalized linear regression model, adjusting for case-mix at the PCSA level and for policies, including rigor of prescription drug monitoring programs and legalized medical marijuana, at the state level. A total of 358,121 patients with advanced OA, with a mean age of 74 years, were included from 4,080 PCSAs. The unadjusted mean percentage of long-term opioid users varied widely across states, ranging from 8.9% (Minnesota) to 26.4% (Alabama), and this variation persisted in the adjusted models. Access to PCPs was only modestly associated with rates of long-term opioid use between PCSAs with highest (&gt;8.6) versus lowest (&lt;3.6) concentration of PCPs (adjusted mean difference 1.4% [95% confidence interval 0.8%, 2.0%]), while access to rheumatologists was not associated with long-term opioid use. We note a substantial statewide variation in rates of long-term treatment with opioids in OA, which is not fully explained by the differences in access to health care providers, varying case-mix, or state-level policies.","Aged;Alabama;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Association;Back Pain;Case Mix;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Female;Geography;Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Linear Regression;Male;Medical Marijuana;Medicare;Minnesota;Neuralgia;Opioids;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Hip;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain Management;Patients;Physicians, Primary Care;Policy;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Program;Rheumatologists;Severity of Illness Index;Therapeutics;Total Joint Replacement;United States","Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Back Pain;Neuralgia;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Hip;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain",Arthritis Rheumatol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30735622,2019,Risk of Prolonged Opioid Use Among Opioid-Naïve Patients After Common Shoulder Arthroscopy Procedures.,"Opioid-related morbidity and mortality are major public health concerns, and the risk of long-term opioid use after shoulder arthroscopy is not well defined. Substance abuse disorders, pain disorders, and psychiatric conditions increase the risk for prolonged opioid use. Case-control study, Level of evidence, 3. Insurance claims data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases was used to identify patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy between January 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015. Opioid-naïve patients were included. New prolonged opioid use was defined as continued opioid use between 91 and 180 days after the index procedure. The authors used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify patient factors associated with the risk of new prolonged opioid use. In this cohort of 104,154 opioid-naïve adult patients, 8686 (8.3%) developed new prolonged opioid use as defined in this study. A total of 31,768 (30.5%) filled an opioid prescription in the 30 days before surgery. Patients who had limited debridement had the highest prolonged use rate (9.0%), followed by rotator cuff repair (8.5%), anterior labrum lesion repair (8.5%), and extensive debridement (8.2%). Patient characteristics associated with the highest odds ratios (ORs) of prolonged opioid use included those who had a total opioid dose during the perioperative period that was ≥743 oral morphine equivalents (ie, at least 149 tablets of 5-mg hydrocodone) (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.9-2.1), followed by patients with a suicide and self-harm disorder (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), a history of alcohol dependence or abuse (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9), a mood disorder (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), an opioid prescription filled in the 30 days before surgery (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), female sex (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.3), an anxiety disorder (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), and a history of a pain diagnosis (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). The risk of prolonged opioid use after arthroscopic shoulder procedures is 8.3%, and it is higher among women and among those with greater opioid use in the early postoperative period, mental health conditions, substance dependence and abuse, and preexisting pain disorders.

30802984,2019,Increasing incidence of IV-drug use associated endocarditis in southern West Virginia and potential economic impact.,"The opioid crisis has disproportionally affected Appalachia. One of the potentially lethal and costly complications associated with IV drug use is infective endocarditis (IE). The goal of this study was to assess the trend and costs of substance abuse associated IE admissions in Southern West Virginia. This is a retrospective analysis of cost, incidence, and geographic patterns of all patients admitted over the last decade with concomitant drug abuse (cocaine, amphetamine, sedative, and other/mixed drug abuse) and IE in the largest tertiary care center for Southern West Virginia. A time series model was used to investigate the effect of drug use on the incidence of IE. A total of 462 patients were hospitalized with IE and concomitant illicit drug use. IE cases increased from 26 admissions in 2008 to 66 in 2015. Patterns of increases in mixed drug use (DRG most often associated with IV drug use in our center) mirrored increases in IE (P = 0.001). From 2008 to 2015, the total hospital charges were $17 306 464 on 462 cases of illicit drug associated IE. Only a fraction of the billed fees (22%) was collected ($3 829 701). The number of patients hospitalized with IE has dramatically increased over the last decade in a pattern that mirrors the increase in mixed drug use. The majority of payers were from underfunded state programs or private pay and thus, only 22% of the hospital charges were paid, leaving a hospital deficit of over $13 476 763 during the study period.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Amphetamine;Appalachian Region;Cocaine;Cost;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Abuse;Economics;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Fees;Goals;Hospital Charges;Hospital Mortality;Hospitals;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Incidence;Infective Endocarditis;Middle Aged;Opioid Crisis;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Sedatives;Socioeconomic Factors;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Survival Rate;Tertiary Care Centers;Time;West Virginia;Young Adult","Drug Abuse;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Infective Endocarditis;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Clin Cardiol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

30962278,2019,Dural Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Produces Female-Specific Responses in Rodent Migraine Models.,"Migraine is the second leading cause for disability worldwide and the most common neurological disorder. It is also three times more common in women; reasons for this sex difference are not known. Using preclinical behavioral models of migraine, we show that application of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the rat dura mater produces cutaneous periorbital hypersensitivity. Surprisingly, this response was observed only in females; dural CGRP at doses from 1 pg to 3.8 μg produce no responses in males. In females, dural CGRP causes priming to a pH 7.0 solution after animals recover from the initial CGRP-induced allodynia. Dural application of interleukin-6 causes acute responses in males and females but only causes priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Intracisternal application of BDNF also causes similar acute hypersensitivity responses in males and females but only priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Females were additionally primed to a subthreshold dose of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mg/kg) following dural CGRP. Finally, the sexually dimorphic responses to dural CGRP were not specific to rats as similar female-specific hypersensitivity responses were seen in mice, where increased grimace responses were also observed. These data are the first to demonstrate that CGRP-induced headache-like behavioral responses at doses up to 3.8 μg are female-specific both acutely and following central and peripheral priming. These data further implicate dural CGRP signaling in the pathophysiology of migraine and propose a model where dural CGRP-based mechanisms contribute to the sexual disparity of this female-biased disorder.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, and CGRP-based therapeutics are efficacious for the treatment of migraine in humans. However, the location of action for CGRP in migraine remains unclear. We show here that application of CGRP to the cranial meninges causes behavioral responses consistent with headache in preclinical rodent models. Surprisingly, however, these responses are only observed in females. Acute responses to meningeal CGRP are female-specific and sensitization to CGRP after two distinct stimuli are also female-specific. These data implicate the dura mater as a primary location of action for CGRP in migraine and suggest that female-specific mechanisms downstream of CGRP receptor activation contribute to the higher prevalence of migraine in women.","Allodynia;Animals;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Disease Models, Animal;Donors;Dura Mater;Female;Gender;Headache;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Interleukin-6;Male;Meninges;Mice;Mice, Inbred ICR;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;Pain;Prevalence;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Rodentia;Sex Characteristics;Sodium Nitroprusside;Solutions;Therapeutics;Time;Women",Allodynia;Headache;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;Pain,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

31154092,2019,Patient Satisfaction and Pain Control Using an Opioid-Sparing Postoperative Pathway.,"Opioids are overprescribed after surgical procedures, leading to dependence and diversion into the community. This can be mitigated by evidence-based prescribing practices. We investigated the feasibility of an opioid-sparing pain management strategy after surgical procedures. Patients undergoing 6 procedures were offered the opportunity to participate in an opioid-sparing pain management pathway. Patients were advised to use acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and were provided with a small ""rescue"" opioid prescription for breakthrough pain. They were then surveyed postoperatively about opioid use and patient-reported outcomes measures. Overall cohort characteristics and differences between opioid users and non-users were analyzed. A total of 190 patients were analyzed. Median prescription size was 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 6) pills and opioid use was 0 (IQR 0 to 4) pills. Fifty-two percent of patients used no opioids after procedures. Median number of leftover pills was 2 (IQR 0 to 5). Median pain score was 1 (IQR 1 to 2) and satisfaction score was 10 (IQR 8 to 10). Almost all (91%) patients agreed that their pain was manageable. Patients who used opioids were younger (52 ± 14 vs 59 ± 13 years; p = 0.001), reported higher pain scores (2 [IQR 1 to 2] vs 1 [1 to 2]; p = 0.014), received larger rescue prescriptions (6 ± 3 vs 4 ± 4 pills; p = 0.003), and were less likely to agree that their pain was manageable (82% vs 98%; p = 0.001). There were no other significant differences between opioid users and non-users.

31221524,2020,West Virginia's model of buprenorphine expansion: Preliminary results.,"West Virginia (WV) is situated at the epicenter of the opioid epidemic with the highest rates of overdose deaths and some of the lowest rates of access to life saving evidence-based medication assisted treatment (MAT) for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). WV used a modified hub-and-spoke model to build organizational capacity for facilities to use buprenorphine to treat patients with OUD and to provide ongoing case consultation. The purpose of this study is to 1) describe the group-base model of buprenorphine treatment and the model used to build organizational capacity, 2) to describe the preliminary results of buprenorphine expansion in WV and 3) to report preliminary data describing and comparing the characteristics of the patients served across five hubs. A single Coordinating Center uses video conferencing to train hubs and provide ongoing case consultation, as well as clinical support. Hubs were trained to deliver a buprenorphine treatment model that is multi-disciplinary and includes group-based medication management and psychosocial therapy. Five regional hubs independently treat patients and are leading MAT expansion in their local areas by training and mentoring spokes (n = 13). As a result of the WV STR funding, 14 health care facilities have started to use buprenorphine, 56 health professionals were trained and 196 patients with OUD have been treated. There were few sociodemographic characteristic differences across patients treated at the five hubs, while there were differences in self-reported alcohol and drug use in the 30 days prior to intake. Additional research is needed to determine whether the WV modified hub-and-spoke model resulted in statistically significant improvements in buprenorphine treatment capacity; there is a need to address MAT stigma and regulatory barriers in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the buprenorphine expansion.","Address;Alcohols;Buprenorphine;Consultation;Death;Drug Overdose;Health;Health Care;Health Personnel;Health Plan Implementation;Humans;Life;Mentoring;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Care Team;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Preliminary Data;Referral and Consultation;Report;Research;Savings;Self;Therapeutics;West Virginia",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31251985,2019,Patterns of prescription opioid use before total hip and knee replacement among US Medicare enrollees.,"To examine patterns of prescription opioid use before total joint replacement (TJR) and factors associated with continuous use of opioids before TJR. We conducted an observational cohort study among Medicare enrollees aged ≥65 years who underwent TJR between 2010 and 2014. Preoperative opioid use was defined as having any opioid prescription in the 12-month period before TJR. Patients who had an opioid prescription every month for a 12-month period were defined as continuous users. We examined patients' demographics, pain-related conditions, medication use, other comorbidities, healthcare utilization and their association with use of opioids before TJR. A total of 473,781 patients underwent TJR:,155,516 THR and 318,265 TKR. Among the total cohort, 60.2% patients had any use of opioids and of those, 12.4% used opioids at least once a month continuously over the 12-month baseline period. Correlates of continuous opioid use included African American race (OR = 2.14, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2.01-2.28, compared to White patients), history of drug abuse (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.95-6.79) and back pain (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 2.24-2.39). In this large cohort of patients undergoing TJR, over 60% ever used opioids and 12.4% of them continuously used opioids in the 12-month prior to surgery. Utilization of opioids became more frequent and high-dosed near the surgery. History of drug abuse, back pain, and African American race were strongly associated with continuous use of opioids preoperatively. Further research is needed to determine short-term and long-term risks of preoperative use of opioids in TJR patients and to optimize pre- and post-TJR pain management of patients with arthritis.","African Americans;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthralgia;Arthritis;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Association;Back Pain;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Drug Abuse;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Health Care;Hip;History;Humans;Knee;Male;Medicare;Opioids;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Hip;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Preoperative Care;Prescriptions;Racial Stocks;Research;Risk;Total Joint Replacement;United States;Whites","Arthralgia;Arthritis;Back Pain;Drug Abuse;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Hip;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain",Osteoarthritis Cartilage,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31303324,2019,Postoperative opioid prescribing is not my job: A qualitative analysis of care transitions.,"Persistent opioid use is common after surgical procedures, and postoperative opioid prescribing often transitions from surgeons to primary care physicians in the months after surgery. It is unknown how surgeons currently transition these patients or the preferred approach to successful coordination of care. This qualitative study aimed to describe transitions of care for postoperative opioid prescribing and identify barriers and facilitators of ideal transitions for potential intervention targets. We conducted a qualitative study of surgeons and primary care physicians at a large academic healthcare system using a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts were independently coded using the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify underlying determinants of physician behaviors. We mapped dominant themes to the Behavior Change Wheel to propose potential interventions targeting these behaiors. Physicians were interviewed between July 2017 and December 2017 beyond thematic saturation (n = 20). Surgeons report passive transitions to primary care physicians after ruling out surgical complications, and these patients often bounce back to the surgeon when primary care physicians are uncertain of the cause of ongoing pain. Ideal practices were identified as setting preoperative expectations and engaging in active transition for postoperative opioid prescribing. We identified 3 behavioral targets for multidisciplinary intervention: knowledge (guidelines for coordination of care), barriers (utilizing support staff for active transition), and professional role (incentive for multidisciplinary collaboration). This qualitative study identifies potential interventions aimed at changing physician behaviors regarding transitions of care for postoperative opioid prescribing. Implementation of these interventions could improve coordination of care for patients with persistent postoperative opioid use.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude of Health Personnel;Back;Behavior;Drug Prescriptions;Expectations;Female;General Surgery;Guideline;Health Care Systems;Humans;Incentives;Interview;Knowledge;Male;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Transfer;Patient Transition;Patients;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Professional Role;Qualitative Research;Report;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Surgery,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31323217,2019,Opioids affect the fetal brain: reframing the detoxification debate.,"Medication-assisted treatment is recommended for individuals with an opioid use disorder, including pregnant women. Medication-assisted treatment during pregnancy provides benefits to the mother and fetus, including better pregnancy outcomes, reduced illicit drug use, and improved prenatal care. An alternative approach, medically supervised withdrawal (detoxification), has, in recent reports, demonstrated a low risk of fetal death and low rates of relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The rates of relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome are questioned by many who view medically supervised withdrawal as unacceptable based on the concern for the potential adverse consequences of relapse to mother and baby. The impact of opioids on the fetal brain have not been integrated into this debate. Studies in animals and human brain tissues demonstrate opioid receptors in neurons, astroglia, and oligodendrocytes. Age-specific normative data from infants, children, and adults have facilitated investigation of the impact of opioids on the human brain in vivo. Collectively, these studies in animals, human neural tissue, adult brains, and the brains of children and newborns demonstrate that opioids adversely affect the human brain, primarily the developing oligodendrocyte and the processes of myelinization (white matter microstructure), connectivity between parts of the brain, and the size of multiple brain regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter. These in vivo studies across the human lifespan suggest vulnerability of specific fronto-temporal-limbic and frontal-subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellum) pathways that are also likely vulnerable in the human fetal brain. The long-term impact of these reproducible changes in the fetal brain in vivo is unclear, but the possibility of lasting injury has been suggested. In light of the recent data on medically supervised withdrawal and the emerging evidence suggesting adverse effects of opioids on the developing fetal brain, a new paradigm of care is needed that includes the preferred option of medication-assisted treatment but also the option of medically supervised opioid withdrawal for a select group of women. Both these treatment options should offer mental health and social services support throughout pregnancy. More research on both opioid exposure on the developing human brain and the impact of medically supervised withdrawal is required to identify appropriate candidates, optimal dose reduction regimens, and gestational age timing for initiating medically supervised withdrawal.","Adult;Affect;Amygdala;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Astrocytes;Basal Ganglia;Brain;Brain Stem;Buprenorphine;Cerebellar White Matter;Cerebellum;Cerebral Cortex;Child;Drug Tapering;Female;Fetal Death;Fetus;Functional Neuroimaging;Gestational Age;Globus Pallidus;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Injuries;Life Span;Light;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Mental Health;Methadone;Mothers;Myelin Sheath;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Neural Pathways;Neurobiology;Neuroimaging;Neurons;News;Oligodendroglia;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnancy Outcome;Pregnant Women;Prenatal Care;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Putamen;Receptors, Opioid;Recurrence;Relapse;Report;Research;Risk;Social Work;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Thalamus;Therapeutics;Tissues;White Matter;Women",Fetal Death;Injuries;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
31349994,2020,New persistent opioid use among older patients following surgery: A Medicare claims analysis.,"Although new persistent opioid use and high-risk prescribing have been recognized as important postoperative complications among younger patients (18-64 years of age), little is known about the incidence for postoperative opioid use among older patients (&gt;65 years of age). We analyzed a 20% national sample of Medicare Part D claims among beneficiaries &gt;65 years of age who underwent a major or minor surgical procedure between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2015. We identified patients without an opioid prescription fill in the year before surgery and examined their perioperative and 6-month postoperative opioid prescription fills to examine the incidence of new persistent opioid use and high-risk prescribing. We identified 81,839 opioid naïve patients who underwent surgery and filled an opioid prescription perioperatively. Overall, 9.8% developed new persistent opioid use. Risk factors for new persistent opioid use included major surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.31), more comorbid conditions (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.58-1.84), mood disorders (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.24), suicide or self-harm (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05-2.44), substance abuse disorders (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.20-1.59), filling an opioid prescription before surgery (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.58-1.77), higher amounts of opioids filled (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.37-1.52), black race (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.36), and Medicaid eligibility (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.35-1.55). About 10% of Medicare beneficiaries who were previously opioid naïve continue to fill opioids past 3 months after surgery. In addition to comorbidities and mental health conditions, new persistent opioid use is associated with surgery type, preoperative opioid fill, high-risk prescribing practices, and sociodemographic factors.","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Humans;Incidence;Insurance Claim Review;Logistic Models;Male;Medicaid;Medicare;Medicare Part D;Mental Health;Minor Surgical Procedures;Mood Disorders;News;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Overall;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Postoperative Complications;Prescriptions;Racial Stocks;Risk;Risk Factors;Self-Injurious Behavior;Substance Abuse;Suicide;United States","Mood Disorders;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications;Substance Abuse",Surgery,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31358302,2019,Naltrexone Treatment for Pregnant Women With Opioid Use Disorder Compared With Matched Buprenorphine Control Subjects.,"The use of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX) for pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) remains understudied. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in a cohort of NTX-treated women. This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 6 mother-infant dyads taking NTX compared with 13 taking buprenorphine (BUP) between 2017 and 2019. Maternal demographic characteristics, any unprescribed or illicit opioid use per urine toxicology or provider report during the pregnancy or 6 months' postdelivery, delivery outcomes, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) outcomes (NAS diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment, and total hospital length of stay) were compared. Maternal and infant demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, with the exception of cigarette smoking in the BUP group being more common (92% vs 33%; P = 0.02). None of the women on NTX versus 23% of the women on BUP had documented opioid misuse (P = 0.52). No infants in the NTX group had a NAS diagnosis versus 92% in the BUP group (P &lt; 0.001). Forty-six percent of the BUP-exposed infants were treated for NAS versus 0% in the NTX group (P &lt; 0.001). NTX-exposed infants had a shorter length of stay (mean [SD], 3.2 [1.6] vs 10.9 [8.2] days; P = 0.008). Maintaining women on NTX during pregnancy was associated with favorable outcomes. These results support the need for larger multicenter studies sufficiently powered to detect possible differences between the medications on long-term maternal and child safety and efficacy outcomes.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Apgar Score;Birth Weight;Buprenorphine;Child;Cigarette Smoking;Cohort Studies;Demography;Diagnosis;Female;Gestational Age;Hospitals;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Intensive Care Units, Neonatal;Length of Stay;Mothers;Multicenter Study;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pilot Projects;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnancy Outcome;Pregnant Women;Report;Retrospective Studies;Safety;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Toxicology;Treatment Outcome;Urine;Women",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Syndrome,Clin Ther,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
31365106,2019,Association of Preoperative Opioid Use With Mortality and Short-term Safety Outcomes After Total Knee Replacement.,"Prescription opioid use is common among patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis before undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). Preoperative opioid use may be associated with worse clinical and safety outcomes after TKR. To determine the association of preoperative opioid use among patients 65 years and older with mortality and other complications at 30 days post-TKR. This cohort study used claims data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014, from a random sample of US Medicare enrollees 65 years and older who underwent TKR. Based on opioid dispensing in 360 days prior to TKR, patients were classified as continuous (≥1 opioid dispensing in each of the past 12 months) or intermittent (any dispensing of opioids in the past 12 months but not continuous use) opioid users or as opioid-naive patients (no opioids dispensed in the past 12 months). Data analyses were conducted from October 3, 2017, to November 8, 2018. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and 30-day post-TKR mortality, hospital readmission, and revision operation. Secondary safety outcomes at 30 days post-TKR included opioid overdose and vertebral and nonvertebral fracture. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Of 316 593 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [5.8] years; 214 677 [67.8%] women) who underwent TKR, 22 895 (7.2%) were continuous opioid users, 161 511 (51.0%) were intermittent opioid users, and 132 187 (41.7%) were opioid naive. In-hospital mortality occurred in 276 patients (0.09%). At 30 days post-TKR, 828 patients (0.26%) died, 16 786 patients (5.30%) had hospital readmission, and 921 patients (0.29%) had a revision operation. All primary and secondary outcomes occurred more frequently among continuous opioid users compared with opioid-naive patients. Compared with opioid-naive patients and after adjusting for demographic characteristics, combined comorbidity score, number of different prescription medications, and frailty, continuous opioid users had greater risk of revision operations (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.15-2.32), vertebral fractures (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.37-4.09), and opioid overdose (HR, 4.82; 95% CI, 1.36-17.07) at 30 days post-TKR. However, after adjusting covariates, there were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.73-1.90) or 30-day (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.73-1.51) mortality between continuous opioid users and opioid-naive patients. After adjusting for baseline risk profiles, including comorbidities and frailty, continuous opioid users had a higher risk of revision operations, vertebral fractures, and opioid overdose at 30 days post-TKR but not of in-hospital or 30-day mortality, compared with opioid-naive patients. These results highlight the need for better understanding of patient characteristics associated with chronic opioid use to optimize preoperative assessment of overall risk after TKR.","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Association;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Comprehension;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Data Analysis;Demography;Female;Frailty;Hospital Mortality;Hospital Readmissions;Hospitals;Humans;Male;Medicare;Mortality;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Overall;Patient Readmission;Patients;Postoperative Complications;Preoperative Period;Prescriptions;Proportional Hazards Models;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Safety;United States;Women","Frailty;Opiate Overdose;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Postoperative Complications",JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31389832,2021,Patient Factors Associated With Opioid Consumption in the Month Following Major Surgery.,"The aim of this study was to determine preoperative patient characteristics associated with postoperative outpatient opioid use and assess the frequency of postoperative opioid overprescribing. Although characteristics associated with inpatient opioid use have been described, data regarding patient factors associated with opioid use after discharge are lacking. This hampers the development of individualized approaches to postoperative prescribing. We included opioid-naïve patients undergoing hysterectomy, thoracic surgery, and total knee and hip arthroplasty in a single-center prospective observational cohort study. Preoperative phenotyping included self-report measures to assess pain severity, fibromyalgia survey criteria score, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, functional status, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Our primary outcome measure was self-reported total opioid use in oral morphine equivalents. We constructed multivariable linear-regression models predicting opioids consumed in the first month following surgery. We enrolled 1181 patients; 1001 had complete primary outcome data and 913 had complete phenotype data. Younger age, non-white race, lack of a college degree, higher anxiety, greater sleep disturbance, heavy alcohol use, current tobacco use, and larger initial opioid prescription size were significantly associated with increased opioid consumption. Median total oral morphine equivalents prescribed was 600 mg (equivalent to one hundred twenty 5-mg hydrocodone pills), whereas median opioid consumption was 188 mg (38 pills). In this prospective cohort of opioid-naïve patients undergoing major surgery, we found a number of characteristics associated with greater opioid use in the first month after surgery. Future studies should address the use of non-opioid medications and behavioral therapies in the perioperative period for these higher risk patients.","Address;Adult;Aged;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Arthroplasty;Cohort Studies;Consumption;Depression;Fatigue;Female;Fibromyalgia;Functional Status;Future;General Surgery;Hip;Humans;Hydrocodone;Hysterectomy;Inpatients;Knee;Linear Regression;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Outpatients;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Measurement;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Perioperative Period;Phenotype;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Prospective Studies;Racial Stocks;Risk;Self;Self Report;Sleep;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Thoracic Surgery;Tobacco Use;Whites","Fatigue;Fibromyalgia;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31421378,2020,Racial Disparities in Receipt of Postoperative Opioids After Pediatric Cholecystectomy.,"Pediatric postoperative opioid prescribing has come under scrutiny as a result of the ongoing opioid epidemic. Previous research has demonstrated that African American adults are less likely to receive analgesics, particularly opioids, after surgery, even after controlling for pain severity. We sought to examine racial disparities in the filling of opioid prescriptions by pediatric surgical patients after cholecystectomy. We studied patients aged 1 to 18 y who were enrolled in Ohio Medicaid and underwent cholecystectomy. Procedures performed in January 2013-July 2016 were included. The percentage of patients who filled a postoperative opioid prescription within 14 d of their procedure was compared between black and white patients using log binomial regression models fit using generalized estimating equations to account for patient clustering within hospitals. We identified 1277 patients who underwent a cholecystectomy. In unadjusted analyses, black children were significantly less likely than white children to fill an opioid prescription postoperatively (74.9% versus 85.7%, P &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for patient-level clinical and demographic characteristics, we found that black children treated at non-children's hospitals in large-/medium-sized urban counties were significantly less likely to fill an opioid prescription after cholecystectomy when compared with white children treated at urban children's hospitals or to white children treated in non-children's hospitals in either large/medium urban counties or other counties. However, this association was partly explained by a longer average length of stay among black children. Black children who undergo cholecystectomy at urban non-children's hospitals are less likely to fill a postoperative opioid prescription than white children who undergo cholecystectomy at those same hospitals or other hospitals. Further research is needed to identify whether this disparity is due to a lower rate of opioid prescribing or a lower rate of prescription filling.","Adjustment;Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Aged;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Blacks;Child;Child, Preschool;Cholecystectomy;Cluster Analysis;Demography;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Healthcare Disparities;Hospitals;Humans;Infant;Length of Stay;Male;Medicaid;Ohio;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Pediatrics;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Research;Severity of Illness Index;United States;Whites","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",J Surg Res,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
31439409,2019,Cingulo-hippocampal effective connectivity positively correlates with drug-cue attentional bias in opioid use disorder.,"Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) often relapse when exposed to opioid-related cues. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified neuronal corticolimbic changes related to drug cue reactivity in OUD. However, the corresponding manner in which brain regions interact is still unclear. Effective (directional) connectivity was analyzed using dynamic causal modeling of fMRI data acquired from 27 OUD participants (13 with OUD and 14 with OUD and cocaine use disorder [OUD+CUD]), while performing an opioid-word Stroop task. Participants were shown opioid and neutral words presented in different colors and were instructed to indicate word color but ignore word meaning. The effects of opioid words relative to neutral words on effective connectivity and on behavioral reaction time were defined as modulatory change and attentional bias, respectively. For all the 27 participants, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to right hippocampus effective connectivity exhibited the largest modulatory change, which was positively correlated with attentional bias. The findings for the ACC to hippocampus EC were consistent across OUD and CUD found in a previous study.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Attentional Bias;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cocaine;Cognition;Color;Cues;Female;Gyrus Cinguli;Hippocampus;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Reaction Time;Relapse;Relatives;Stroop Test;Temporal Lobe;fMRI",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
31478976,2020,A Pathway for Developing Postoperative Opioid Prescribing Best Practices.,"Opioid prescriptions after surgery are effective for pain management but have been a significant contributor to the current opioid epidemic. Our objective is to review pragmatic approaches to develop and implement evidence-based guidelines based on a learning health system model. During the last 2 years there has been a preponderance of data demonstrating that opioids are overprescribed after surgery. This contributes to a number of adverse outcomes, including diversion of leftover pills in the community and rising rates of opioid use disorder. We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed review of published examples and reviewed our institutional experience in developing and implementing evidence-based postoperative prescribing recommendations. Thirty studies have described collecting data regarding opioid prescribing and patient-reported use in a cohort of 13,591 patients. Three studies describe successful implementation of opioid prescribing recommendations based on patient-reported opioid use. These settings utilized learning health system principles to establish a cycle of quality improvement based on data generated from routine practice. Key components of this pathway were collecting patient-reported outcomes, identifying key stakeholders, and continual assessment. These pathways were rapidly adopted and resulted in a 37% to 63% reduction in prescribing without increasing requests for refills or patient-reported pain scores. A pathway for creating evidence-based opioid-prescribing recommendations can be utilized in diverse practice environments and can lead to significantly decreased opioid prescribing without adversely affecting patient outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Best Practices;Community;Environment;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Lead;Learning Health System;MEDLINE;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcome Measures;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;PubMed;Quality Improvement;Review","Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

31503160,2019,Effects of Shared Decision Making on Opioid Prescribing After Hysterectomy.,"To evaluate the effects of shared decision making using a simple decision aid for opioid prescribing after hysterectomy. We conducted a prospective quality initiative study including all patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign, nonobstetric indications between March 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018, at our academic institution. Using a visual decision aid, patients received uniform education regarding postoperative pain management. They were then educated on the department's guidelines regarding the maximum number of tablets recommended per prescription and the mean number of opioid tablets used by a similar cohort of patients in a previously published study at our institution. Patients were then asked to choose their desired number of tablets to receive on discharge. Structured telephone interviews were conducted 14 days after surgery. The primary outcome was total opioids prescribed before compared with after implementation of the decision aid. Secondary outcomes included opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, and refill requests after intervention implementation. Of 170 eligible patients, 159 (93.5%) used the decision aid (one patient who used the decision aid was subsequently excluded from the analysis owing to significant perioperative complications), including 110 (69.6%) laparoscopic, 40 (25.3%) vaginal, and eight (5.3%) abdominal hysterectomies. Telephone surveys were completed for 89.2% (n=141) of participants. Student's t-test showed that patients who participated in the decision aid (post-decision aid cohort) were discharged with significantly fewer oral morphine equivalents than patients who underwent hysterectomy before implementation of the decision aid (pre-decision aid cohort) (92±35 vs 160±81, P&lt;.01), with no significant change in the number of requested refills (9.5% [n=15] vs 5.7% [n=14], P=.15). In the post-decision aid cohort, 76.6% of patients (n=121) chose fewer tablets than the guideline-allotted maximum. Approximately 76% of patients (n=102) reported having leftover tablets. This quality improvement initiative illustrates that a simple decision aid can result in a significant decrease in opioid prescribing without compromising patient satisfaction or postoperative pain management.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Consumption;Decision Aids;Decision Making, Shared;Decision Support Techniques;Education;Female;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Hysterectomy;Interviews, Telephone;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Prospective Studies;Quality Improvement;Students;Surveys;Tablets;Telephone;Uniforms","Pain, Postoperative",Obstet Gynecol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31568099,2019,A randomized controlled trial testing a virtual perspective-taking intervention to reduce race and socioeconomic status disparities in pain care.,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial of an individually tailored, virtual perspective-taking intervention to reduce race and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in providers' pain treatment decisions. Physician residents and fellows (n = 436) were recruited from across the United States for this two-part online study. Providers first completed a bias assessment task in which they made treatment decisions for virtual patients with chronic pain who varied by race (black/white) and SES (low/high). Providers who demonstrated a treatment bias were randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of personalized feedback about their bias, real-time dynamic interactions with virtual patients, and videos depicting how pain impacts the patients' lives. Treatment bias was re-assessed 1 week later. Compared with the control group, providers who received the tailored intervention had 85% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against black patients and 76% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against low SES patients at follow-up. Providers who received the intervention for racial bias also showed increased compassion for patients compared with providers in the control condition. Group differences did not emerge for provider comfort in treating patients. Results suggest an online intervention that is tailored to providers according to their individual treatment biases, delivers feedback about these biases, and provides opportunities for increased contact with black and low SES patients, can produce substantial changes in providers' treatment decisions, resulting in more equitable pain care. Future studies should examine how these effects translate to real-world patient care and the optimal timing/dose of the intervention.",Adult;Bias;Blacks;Chronic Pain;Clinical Decision-Making;Compassion;Control Groups;Feedback;Female;Future;Healthcare Disparities;Humans;Internet-Based Intervention;Male;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Care;Patients;Physicians;Racial Stocks;Racism;Randomized Controlled Trial;Social Class;Socioeconomic Status;Therapeutics;Time;United States;User-Computer Interface;Whites,Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
31579860,2019,Positron emission tomography imaging of endogenous mu-opioid mechanisms during pain and migraine.,"The enormous advancements in the medical imaging methods witnessed in the past decades have allowed clinical researchers to study the function of the human brain in vivo, both in health and disease. In addition, a better understanding of brain responses to different modalities of stimuli such as pain, reward, or the administration of active or placebo interventions has been achieved through neuroimaging methods. Although magnetic resonance imaging has provided important information regarding structural, hemodynamic, and metabolic changes in the central nervous system related to pain, magnetic resonance imaging does not address modulatory pain systems at the molecular level (eg, endogenous opioid). Such important information has been obtained through positron emission tomography, bringing insights into the neuroplastic changes that occur in the context of the pain experience. Positron emission tomography studies have not only confirmed the brain structures involved in pain processing and modulation but also have helped elucidate the neural mechanisms that underlie healthy and pathological pain regulation. These data have shown some of the biological basis of the interindividual variability in pain perception and regulation. In addition, they provide crucial information to the mechanisms that drive placebo and nocebo effects, as well as represent an important source of variability in clinical trials. Positron emission tomography studies have also permitted exploration of the dynamic interaction between behavior and genetic factors and between different pain modulatory systems. This narrative review will present a summary of the main findings of the positron emission tomography studies that evaluated the functioning of the opioidergic system in the context of pain.",Address;Administration;Behavior;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Comprehension;Disease;Drive;Genetics;Health;Hemodynamics;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Medical Imaging;Methods;Migraine Disorders;Neuroimaging;Nocebo Effect;Opioids;Pain;Pain Perception;Pets;Placebos;Positron-Emission Tomography;Regulation;Research Personnel;Review;Reward,Chronic Pain;Migraine Disorders;Pain,Pain Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31764386,2020,Ethnic disparities in pain processing among healthy adults: μ-opioid receptor binding potential as a putative mechanism.,"Although ethnic differences in pain perception are well documented, the underlying mechanism for these outcomes has not been established. µ-opioid receptor (MOR) function might contribute to this disparity, given that MORs play a key role in pain sensitivity and modulation. However, no study has characterized ethnic differences in MOR physiology. This study sought to address this knowledge gap by examining differences in µ-selective agonist binding potential (BPND; [C]-Carfentanil) between 27 non-Hispanic black (NHB) and 27 demographically similar, non-Hispanic white participants. Participants completed questionnaires and two 90-minute high-resolution research tomograph positron emission tomography (PET) imaging sessions. During PET imaging, a capsaicin or control cream was applied to individuals' arms, and pain ratings were collected. Bonferroni-corrected PET volumes of interest analyses revealed significantly greater [C]-Carfentanil BPND among NHB participants in bilateral ventral striatum ([left]: F1,52 = 16.38, P &lt; 0.001; [right]: F1,52 = 21.76, P &lt; 0.001), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ([left] F1,52 = 17.3, P &lt; 0.001; [right]: F1,52 = 14.17, P &lt; 0.001), bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ([left]: F1,52 = 10.4, P = 0.002; [right]: F1,52 = 12.91, P = 0.001), and right insula (F1,52 = 11.0, P = 0.002). However, there were no significant main effects of condition or ethnicity × condition interaction effects across models, likely attributable to individual variability in the direction of change within groups. BPND values were significantly correlated with pain ratings collected during the capsaicin condition (r range = 0.34-0.46, P range = 0.01-0.001). Results suggest that NHB individuals might have generally greater unoccupied MOR density than non-Hispanic white peers. Findings have implications for physiological differences underlying ethnicity-related pain disparities. If replicated, these results further emphasize the need for tailored treatments in historically underserved populations.","Address;Adult;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Arm;Blacks;Brain;Capsaicin;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Ethnic Groups;Female;Fentanyl;Hispanics;Humans;Knowledge;Male;Needs;Pain;Pain Perception;Pain Threshold;Pets;Physiology;Play;Populations, Underserved;Positron-Emission Tomography;Questionnaires;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Research;Role;Sensitivity;Therapeutics;Ventral Striatum;Whites",Pain,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
31815209,2019,New discoveries in migraine mechanisms and therapeutic targets.,"Migraine is among the most common and most disabling disorders worldwide, yet its underlying pathophysiology is among the most poorly understood. New information continues to emerge on mechanisms within the central and peripheral nervous systems that may contribute to migraine attacks. Additionally, new therapeutics have recently become available and along with much needed relief for many patients, these drugs provide insight into the disorder based on their mechanism of action. This review will cover new findings within the last several years that add to the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, including those related to the vasculature, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and mechanisms within the cortex and meninges that may contribute to attacks. Discussion will also cover recent findings on novel therapeutic targets, several of which continue to show promise in new preclinical studies, including acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and the delta-opioid receptor (DOR).","Acid Sensing Ion Channels;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Comprehension;Cortical Spreading Depression;Dura Mater;Headache;Hypothalamus;Meninges;Migraine Disorders;News;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Review;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics",Headache;Migraine Disorders,Curr Opin Physiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31851641,2020,Health Care Spending and New Persistent Opioid Use After Surgery.,"We sought to describe the differences in health care spending and utilization among patients who develop persistent postoperative opioid use. Although persistent opioid use following surgery has garnered concern, its impact on health care costs and utilization remains unknown. We examined insurance claims among 133,439 opioid-naive adults undergoing surgery. Outcomes included 6-month postoperative health care spending; proportion of spending attributable to admission, readmission, ambulatory or emergency care; monthly spending 6 months before and following surgery. We defined persistent opioid use as continued opioid fills beyond 3 months postoperatively. We used linear regression to estimate outcomes adjusting for clinical covariates. In this cohort, 8103 patients developed persistent opioid use. For patients who underwent inpatient procedures, new persistent opioid use was associated with health care spending (+$2700 per patient, P &lt; 0.001) compared with patients who did not develop new persistent use. For patients who underwent outpatient procedures, new persistent opioid use was similarly correlated with higher health care spending (+$1500 per patient, P &lt; 0.001) compared with patients who did not develop new persistent use. Patients without persistent opioid use returned to baseline health care spending within 6 months, regardless of other complications. However, patients with persistent opioid use had sustained increases in spending by approximately $200 per month. Unlike other postoperative complications, persistent opioid use is associated with sustained increases in spending due to greater readmissions and ambulatory care visits. Early identification of patients vulnerable to persistent use may enhance the value of surgical care.","Adult;Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Emergency Care;Female;General Surgery;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Humans;Inpatients;Insurance;Linear Regression;Male;Middle Aged;News;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Postoperative Complications;Procedures;Risk Factors;United States","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

A consensus study using an online, modified Delphi technique and Research Electronic Data Capture web application was conducted among VA doctors of chiropractic. Investigators reviewed the scientific literature pertaining to diagnosis and treatment of nonsurgical, neuromusculoskeletal LBP. Thirty seed statements summarizing evidence for chiropractic management, a graphical stepped management tool outlining diagnosis-informed treatment approaches, and support materials were then reviewed by an expert advisory committee. Email notifications invited 113 VA chiropractic clinicians to participate as Delphi panelists. Panelists rated the appropriateness of the seed statements and the stepped process on a 1-to-9 scale using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles methodology. Statements were accepted when both the median rating and 80% of all ratings occurred within the highly appropriate range. Thirty-nine panelists (74% male) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 46 (11) years and clinical experience of 17 (11) years participated in the study. Accepted statements addressed included (1) essential components of chiropractic care, (2) treatments for conditions causing or contributing to LBP, (3) spinal manipulation mechanisms, (4) descriptions and mechanisms of commonly used chiropractic interventions, and (5) a graphical stepped clinical management tool. This study group produced a chiropractic clinical decision aid for LBP management, which can be used to support evidence-based care decisions for veterans with LBP.","Adult;Advisory Committees;California;Chiropractic;Clinical Decision-Making;Clinical Protocols;Complementary Therapies;Consensus;Decision Aids;Decision Support Techniques;Delphi Technique;Diagnosis;Electronic Mail;Electronics;Female;Health Care;Humans;Literature;Los Angeles;Low Back Pain;Male;Manipulation, Chiropractic;Manipulation, Spinal;Middle Aged;Research;Research Personnel;Scales;Seeds;Standards;Therapeutics;United States;Universities;Veterans",Low Back Pain,J Manipulative Physiol Ther,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31880801,2019,Association of State Opioid Duration Limits With Postoperative Opioid Prescribing.,"Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published opioid prescribing guidelines in March 2016, 31 states have implemented legislation to restrict the duration of opioid prescriptions for acute pain. However, the association of these policies with the amount of opioid prescribed following surgery remains unknown. To examine the association of opioid prescribing duration limits with postoperative opioid prescribing in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the first 2 states to implement limits after March 2016. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined immediate level and slope changes in monthly outcomes after prescribing limit implementation in Massachusetts and Connecticut. These states implemented 7-day limits on initial opioid prescriptions on March 14, 2016, and July 1, 2016, respectively. Using the 2014 to 2017 IBM MarketScan Research Database, 16 281 opioid-naive adults in these states who filled a prescription within 3 days of surgery between July 1, 2014, and November 30, 2017, were identified. Data were analyzed from December 2018 to June 2019. The primary outcome was the prescription size in oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) for the initial postoperative opioid prescription (one 5/325 mg hydrocodone-acetaminophen pill = 5 OMEs). Secondary outcomes included days supplied in the initial prescription and the proportion of initial prescriptions exceeding a 7-day supply. In total, 16 281 opioid-naive patients (9708 [59.6%] female; median [interquartile range] age range, 45-54 [35-44 to 55-64] years) undergoing surgical procedures were included. In Massachusetts, there were 5340 and 5435 patients in the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, respectively. In Connecticut, there were 2869 and 2637 patients in the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, respectively. Limit implementation in Massachusetts was associated with an immediate mean level decrease in prescription size (-38 OMEs [95% CI, -44 to -32 OMEs]) and with a mean decrease in slope (-1.5 OMEs/mo [95% CI, -2.1 to -0.9 OMEs/mo]). Implementation was also associated with an immediate mean level decrease in days supplied (-0.4 days [95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2 days]) and the proportion of prescriptions exceeding a 7-day supply (-5.9 percentage points [95% CI, -7.9 to -3.9 percentage points]). In contrast, limit implementation in Connecticut was not associated with level or slope changes in any outcome. Opioid prescribing duration limits had a variable association with postoperative opioid prescribing in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The mean opioid prescription size filled, days supplied, and prescribing exceeding a 7-day supply decreased after limit implementation in Massachusetts only. Given the potential differences in policy dissemination and uptake, efforts to reduce opioid prescribing should also include surgeon education and evidence-based prescribing recommendations.","Acetaminophen;Acute Pain;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Connecticut;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug and Narcotic Control;Education;Female;General Surgery;Guideline;Humans;Hydrocodone;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Legislation;Male;Massachusetts;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Diversion;Prescriptions;Research;Substance-Related Disorders;Supplies;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative","Acute Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Substance-Related Disorders",JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

32022738,2021,Prevalence and Patterns of Opioid Use Before and After Liver Transplantation.,"Opioid use in liver transplantation is poorly understood and has potential associated morbidity. Using a national data set of employer-based insurance claims, we identified 1257 adults who underwent liver transplantation between December 2009 and February 2015. We categorized patients based on their duration of opioid fills over the year before and after transplant admission as opioid-naive/no fills, chronic opioid use (≥120 d supply), and intermittent use (all other use). We calculated risk-adjusted prevalence of peritransplant opioid fills, assessed changes in opioid use after transplant, and identified correlates of persistent or increased opioid use posttransplant. Overall, 45% of patients filled ≥1 opioid prescription in the year before transplant (35% intermittent use, 10% chronic). Posttransplant, 61% of patients filled an opioid prescription 0-2 months after discharge, and 21% filled an opioid between 10-12 months after discharge. Among previously opioid-naive patients, 4% developed chronic use posttransplant. Among patients with pretransplant opioid use, 84% remained intermittent or increased to chronic use, and 73% of chronic users remained chronic users after transplant. Pretransplant opioid use (risk factor) and hepatobiliary malignancy (protective) were the only factors independently associated with risk of persistent or increased posttransplant opioid use. Prescription opioid use is common before and after liver transplant, with intermittent and chronic use largely persisting, and a small development of new chronic use posttransplant. To minimize the morbidity of long-term opioid use, it is critical to improve pain management and optimize opioid use before and after liver transplant.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Cancer;Chronic Pain;Databases, Factual;Dataset;Drug Utilization;Female;Humans;Insurance;Liver Diseases;Liver Transplantation;Male;Middle Aged;Morbidity;News;Opioids;Overall;Pain Management;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Supplies;Time Factors;Transplants;Treatment Outcome;United States",Cancer;Chronic Pain;Liver Diseases;Pain,Transplantation,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32058182,2020,Long-term treatment retention in West Virginia's comprehensive opioid addiction treatment (COAT) program.,"The United States continues to experience an opioid epidemic of unprecedented proportions despite FDA approval of life saving medications, such as buprenorphine. This paper describes a novel group-based buprenorphine treatment model and summarizes patient characteristics and treatment retention. This model, known as the Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment (COAT) program, was developed in West Virginia, the epicenter of the opioid epidemic. Data on 454 patients actively enrolled in the COAT program were extracted from an administrative clinical data set and electronic medical records and analyzed using descriptive and quantitative analysis to determine long-term retention in treatment using frequencies and means. The characteristics of the 454 patients are as follows: average age of 39, 53% female, predominantly white (94%) and Medicaid was the primary insurance provider (68%). Analysis of retention showed 37.8% of patents were retained less than one year and 14.7% were retained 10 or more years. Initiating treatment at a younger age was associated with long-term retention. Opioid use disorder is a chronic relapsing disease and treatment models that retain patients long-term have the greatest benefit. The COAT model has been successful in retaining patients long-term in a rural setting where barriers to treatment are many.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Dataset;Disease;Electronic Health Records;Female;Humans;Insurance Carriers;Life;Male;Medicaid;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paper;Patent;Patients;Program;Savings;Therapeutics;United States;West Virginia;Whites",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Neurol Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32124732,2020,Sensory-Discriminative Three-Dimensional Body Pain Mobile App Measures Versus Traditional Pain Measurement With a Visual Analog Scale: Validation Study.,"To quantify pain severity in patients and the efficacy treatments, researchers and clinicians apply tools such as the traditional visual analog scale (VAS) that leads to inaccurate interpretation of the main sensory pain. This study aimed to validate the pain measurements of a neuroscience-based 3D body pain mobile app called GeoPain. Patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) were assessed using GeoPain measures in comparison to VAS and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), pain and mood scales, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA), scatter score analysis, Pearson methods, and effect size were used to determine the correlation between GeoPain and VAS measures. The PCA resulted in two main orthogonal components: first principal component (PC1) and second principal component (PC2). PC1 comprises a combination score of all GeoPain measures, which had a high internal consistency and clustered together in TMD pain. PC2 included VAS and PANAS. All loading coefficients for GeoPain measures in PC1 were above 0.70, with low loadings for VAS and PANAS. Meanwhile, PC2 was dominated by a VAS and PANAS coefficient &gt;0.4. Repeated measure analysis revealed a strong correlation between the VAS and mood scores from PANAS over time, which might be related to the subjectivity of the VAS measure, whereas sensory-discriminative GeoPain measures, not VAS, demonstrated an association between chronicity and TMD pain in locations spread away from the most commonly reported area or pain epicenter (P=.01). Analysis using VAS did not detect an association at baseline between TMD and chronic pain. The long-term reliability (lag &gt;1 day) was consistently high for the pain area and intensity number summation (PAINS) with lag autocorrelations averaging between 0.7 and 0.8, and greater than the autocorrelations for VAS averaging between 0.3 and 0.6. The combination of higher reliability for PAINS and its objectivity, displayed by the lack of association with PANAS as compared with VAS, indicated that PAINS has better sensitivity and reliability for measuring treatment effect over time for sensory-discriminative pain. The effect sizes for PAINS were larger than those for VAS, consequently requiring smaller sample sizes to assess the analgesic efficacy of treatment if PAINS was used versus VAS. The PAINS effect size was 0.51 SD for both facial sides and 0.60 SD for the right side versus 0.35 SD for VAS. Therefore, the sample size required to detect such effect sizes with 80% power would be n=125 per group for VAS, but as low as n=44 per group for PAINS, which is almost a third of the sample size needed by VAS. GeoPain demonstrates precision and reliability as a 3D mobile interface for measuring and analyzing sensory-discriminative aspects of subregional pain in terms of its severity and response to treatment, without being influenced by mood variations from patients.","Affect;Analgesics;Association;Chronic Pain;Facial Pain;Female;Humans;Lead;Measures;Methods;Migraine Disorders;Mobile Applications;Mood;Neurosciences;Pain;Pain Measurement;Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis;Patients;Power, Psychological;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Research Personnel;Sample Size;Scales;Schedules;Sensitivity;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation;Treatment Efficacy;Validation Study;Visual Analog Scale",Chronic Pain;Facial Pain;Migraine Disorders;Pain;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32142151,2020,Experimenter- and Infrared Thermography-Derived Measures of Capsaicin-Induced Neurogenic Flare Among Non-Hispanic White and Black Adults.,"Capsaicin is a widely utilized experimental pain stimulus; however, few studies have reported on ethnic differences in pain responses to capsaicin. The present study used infrared thermography to 1) measure differences in capsaicin-induced neurogenic flare between non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults and 2) determine the association between neurogenic flare and secondary hyperalgesia. Fifty-four participants (NHB N = 28) underwent heat/capsaicin sensitization model procedures. Neurogenic flare was examined using experimenter (i.e., subjective) and thermography (i.e., objective) measurements. A typically nonpainful mechanical punctate probe was used to measure secondary hyperalgesia. Ethnic groups did not significantly differ in age, sex, marital status, or personal income. Although experimenters rated a significantly wider area of capsaicin-related neurogenic flare among NHW compared with NHB participants (F1, 52 = 8.33, P = 0.006), thermography results showed no differences between groups in neurogenic flares (F1, 52 = 0.01, P = 0.93). Further, although NHB individuals reported greater average pain during the capsaicin procedures compared with NHW individuals (NHB = 58.57 [3.67], NHW = 46.46 [3.81]; F2, 51 = 5.19, P = 0.03), the groups did not differ in secondary hyperalgesia (F2, 51 = 0.03, P = 0.86), and ethnicity did not moderate the association between neurogenic flare and secondary hyperalgesia (F3, 50 = 0.24, P = 0.87). Findings cautiously support the use of infrared thermography over subjective experimenter report when measuring neurogenic inflammation in diverse samples. However, infrared thermography should not be used as a diagnostic tool for pain, given the lack of association between these factors. Future research is warranted to replicate these findings in a larger and more diverse sample to determine accurate neurogenic inflammation measures across other ethnic minority populations.",Adult;African Americans;Association;Blacks;Capsaicin;Ethnic Groups;Future;Heat;Hispanics;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Income;Marital Status;Measures;Minority Groups;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain;Population;Procedures;Report;Research;Sex;Thermography;Whites,Hyperalgesia;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain,Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32145488,2020,Suppression of cocaine relapse-like behaviors upon pimavanserin and lorcaserin co-administration.,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a major public health challenge for which there are no pharmacotherapeutics approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The propensity to relapse in CUD involves several vulnerability factors including sensitivity to cues associated with cocaine-taking. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission, particularly through the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR), is mechanistically linked to cocaine-seeking in preclinical models. In the present experiments, we employed self-administration assays in male rats to investigate whether acute and/or repeated administration of the FDA-approved selective 5-HT2AR antagonist/inverse agonist pimavanserin, selective 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin or their combination would alter cocaine intake and/or cocaine-seeking behavior. We found that acute administration of lorcaserin, but not pimavanserin, attenuated cocaine intake while pimavanserin plus lorcaserin did not impact cocaine self-administration. In contrast, 10-days of repeated administration of pimavanserin, lorcaserin, or pimavanserin plus lorcaserin during forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration, blunted cocaine-seeking, similar to the acute administration of each ligand. Taken together, these data reveal the efficacy of repeated treatment with pimavanserin plus lorcaserin to attenuate factors important to relapse-like behaviors in rodent models of CUD.

32187028,2022,Preoperative Opioid Use and Readmissions Following Surgery.,"To assess the association between preoperative opioid exposure and readmissions following common surgery. Preoperative opioid use is common, but its effect on opioid-related, pain-related, respiratory-related, and all-cause readmissions following surgery is unknown. We analyzed claims data from a 20% national Medicare sample of patients ages ≥ 65 with Medicare Part D claims undergoing surgery between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2016. We grouped patients by the dose, duration, recency, and continuity of preoperative opioid prescription fills. We used logistic regression to examine the association between prior opioid exposure and 30-day readmissions, adjusted for patient risk factors and procedure type. Of 373,991 patients, 168,579 (45%) filled a preoperative opioid prescription within 12 months of surgery, ranging from minimal to chronic high use. Preoperative opioid exposure was associated with higher rate of opioid-related readmissions, compared with naive patients [low: aOR=1.63, 95% CI=1.26-2.12; high: aOR=3.70, 95% CI=2.71-5.04]. Preoperative opioid exposure was also associated with higher risk of pain-related readmissions [low: aOR=1.27, 95% CI=1.23-1.32; high: aOR=1.62, 95% CI=1.53-1.71] and respiratory-related readmissions [low: aOR=1.10, 95% CI=1.05-1.16; high: aOR=1.44, 95% CI=1.34-1.55]. Low, moderate, and high chronic preoperative opioid exposures were predictive of all-cause readmissions (low: OR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12); high: OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.18-1.29). Higher levels of preoperative opioid exposure are associated with increased risk of readmissions after surgery. These findings emphasize the importance of screening patients for preoperative opioid exposure and creating risk mitigation strategies for patients.","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Female;General Surgery;Humans;Incidence;Logistic Regression;Male;Medicare;Medicare Part D;Opioids;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Readmission;Patients;Postoperative Period;Preoperative Care;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Procedures;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Screening;United States","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32227158,2020,"The Unique and Interactive Effects of Patient Race, Patient Socioeconomic Status, and Provider Attitudes on Chronic Pain Care Decisions.","Compared to White and high socioeconomic status (SES) patients, Black and low SES patients receive less adequate pain care. Providers may contribute to these disparities by making biased decisions that are driven, in part, by their attitudes about race and SES. We examined the effects of patient race and SES on providers' chronic pain decisions and the extent to which providers' implicit and explicit attitudes about race and SES were related to these decisions. Physician residents/fellows (n = 436) made pain care decisions for 12 computer-simulated patients with chronic back pain that varied by race (Black/White) and SES (low/high). Physicians also completed measures assessing implicit and explicit attitudes about race and SES. There were three significant race-by-SES interactions: (a) For high SES patients, Black (vs. White) patients were rated as having more pain interference; the opposite race difference emerged for low SES patients. (b) For high SES patients, Black (vs. White) patients were rated as being in greater distress; no race difference emerged for low SES patients. (c) For low SES patients, White (vs. Black) patients were more likely to be recommended workplace accommodations; no race difference emerged for high SES patients. Additionally, providers were more likely to recommend opioids to Black (vs. White) and low (vs. high) SES patients, and were more likely to use opioid contracts with low (vs. high) SES patients. Providers' implicit and explicit attitudes predicted some, but not all, of their pain-related ratings. These results highlight the need to further examine the effects of patient race and SES simultaneously in the context of pain care.",Adult;Attitude;Attitude of Health Personnel;Back Pain;Blacks;Chronic Pain;Clinical Decision-Making;Computers;Contracts;Decision Making;Female;Humans;Male;Measures;Needs;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Physicians;Prejudice;Race Factors;Racial Stocks;Social Class;Socioeconomic Status;Whites;Workplace,Back Pain;Chronic Pain;Pain,Ann Behav Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

The purpose of this study was to determine the longitudinal associations between school climate and substance use initiation in a group of middle school students. Parallel latent growth curve modeling was used to examine changes among study variables longitudinally using a sample of 2,097 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students across 16 regional schools located in three counties in West Virginia. Results suggest that a positive school climate may prevent substance use initiation (β = -0.07 to -0.25, p &lt; .01). However, perceptions of school climate decreased on their own over time (β = -0.28 to -0.66, p &lt; .01). Furthermore, substance use initiation also increased as students grew older (β = 0.96 to 0.99, p &lt; .01) and reduced the effects of school climate longitudinally (β = -0.07 to -0.24, p &lt; .01). Early substance use initiation may be a warning sign of other underlying student issues and requires additional school support to foster student success. Findings suggest that a positive school climate may delay substance use initiation and promote school success. School climate may, therefore, be useful as an intervention to support school-based health promotion.",Adolescence;Adolescent;Alcohols;Association;Behavior;Cannabis;Climate;Growth;Health Promotion;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Longitudinal Studies;Perception;School Health Services;Schools;Students;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Time;Tobacco;West Virginia,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Health Educ Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32302791,2020,"A randomized trial to examine the mechanisms of cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness-based psychosocial treatments for chronic pain: Study protocol.","This randomized trial will evaluate the mechanisms of three chronic pain treatments: cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness meditation (MM), and activation skills (AS). We will determine the extent to which late-treatment improvement in primary outcome (pain interference) is predicted by early-treatment changes in cognitive content, cognitive process, and/or activity level. The shared versus specific role of these mechanisms across the three treatments will be evaluated during treatment (Primary Aim), and immediately post-treatment to examine relapse mechanisms (Secondary Aim). We will enroll 300 individuals with chronic pain (with low back pain as a primary or secondary condition), with 240 projected to complete the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to eight, 1.5 h telehealth group sessions of CT, MM, or AS. Mechanisms and outcomes will be assessed twice daily during 2-week baseline, 4-week treatment period, and 4-week post-treatment epoch via random cue-elicited ecological momentary assessment (EMA); activity level will be monitored during these time epochs via daily monitoring with ActiGraph technology. The primary outcome will be measured by the PROMIS 5-item Pain Interference scale. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to test the primary aims. This study is pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03687762). This study will determine the temporal sequence of lagged mediation effects to evaluate rates of change in outcome as a function of change in mediators. The findings will provide an empirical basis for enhancing and streamlining psychosocial chronic pain interventions.

32352932,2020,The cellular basis of protease-activated receptor 2-evoked mechanical and affective pain.,"Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) has long been implicated in inflammatory and visceral pain, but the cellular basis of PAR2-evoked pain has not been delineated. Although PAR2-evoked pain has been attributed to sensory neuron expression, RNA-sequencing experiments show ambiguous F2rl1 mRNA detection. Moreover, many pharmacological tools for PAR2 are nonspecific, acting also on the Mas-related GPCR family (Mrg) that are highly enriched in sensory neurons. We sought to clarify the cellular basis of PAR2-evoked pain. We developed a PAR2-conditional knockout mouse and specifically deleted PAR2 in all sensory neurons using the PirtCre mouse line. Our behavioral findings show that PAR2 agonist-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia and facial grimacing, but not thermal hyperalgesia, are dependent on PAR2 expression in sensory neurons that project to the hind paw in male and female mice. F2rl1 mRNA is expressed in a discrete population (~4%) of mostly small-diameter sensory neurons that coexpress the Nppb and IL31ra genes. This cell population has been implicated in itch, but our work shows that PAR2 activation in these cells causes clear pain-related behaviors from the skin. Our findings show that a discrete population of DRG sensory neurons mediate PAR2-evoked pain.","Anesthesiology;Animals;Behavior;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Family;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes, ras;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Neurosciences;Pain;Peptide Hydrolases;Population;RNA, Messenger;Receptor, PAR-2;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Skin;Visceral Pain;Work","Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Visceral Pain",JCI Insight,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32389404,2020,High-Risk Prescribing Increases Rates of New Persistent Opioid Use in Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients.,"The association between surgeon prescribing practices and new persistent postoperative opioid use is not well understood. We examined the association between surgeon prescribing and new persistent use among total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients. A retrospective analysis of Medicare claims in Michigan was performed. The study cohort consisted of orthopedic surgeons performing THAs from 2013 to 2016 and their opioid-naïve patients, aged &gt;65 years. High-risk prescribing included high daily doses, overlapping benzodiazepine prescriptions, concurrent opioid prescriptions, prescriptions from multiple providers, or long-acting opioid prescriptions. The occurrence of a preoperative prescription, initial prescription size, and 30-day prescription dosage were examined as individual exposures. Surgeons were categorized into quartiles by prescribing practices, and multilevel hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine associations with postoperative new persistent opioid use. Surgeons exhibited high-risk prescribing for 66% of encounters. Patients of surgeons with the highest rates of high-risk prescribing were more likely to develop persistent use compared with patients of surgeons with the lowest rates (adjusted rates: 9.7% vs 4.6%, P = .011). Patients of surgeons with initial prescription sizes in the ""high"" (third) quartile (adjusted odds ratio, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-5.51), and of surgeons in the ""highest"" (fourth) quartile of 30-day prescription dosage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.61), were more likely to develop persistent opioid use compared with patients of surgeons with low initial and 30-day prescription sizes, respectively. The development of persistent opioid use after surgery is multifactorial, and surgeon prescribing patterns play an important role. Reducing prescribing and encouraging opioid alternatives could minimize postoperative persistent opioid use.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Association;Benzodiazepine;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Drug Prescriptions;General Surgery;Hip Replacement, Total;Humans;Logistic Regression;Medicare;Michigan;News;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Orthopedic Surgeons;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Play;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Role;Surgeons;THA;United States","Pain, Postoperative",J Arthroplasty,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32590196,2020,Quantifying enhanced risk from alcohol and other factors in polysubstance-related deaths.,"To quantify how alcohol, polysubstance use and other factors influence opioid concentrations in drug-related deaths in West Virginia (WV), United States. Multiple linear regression models were employed to identify relationships among alcohol, other factors, and the concentrations of four commonly identified opioids (fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone), accounting for demographic, toxicological and comorbid characteristics in WV drug-related deaths from 2005 to 2018. Alcohol concentrations of 0.08% or above were associated with significant reductions in blood concentrations of fentanyl (27.5%), hydrocodone (30.5%) and methadone (32.4%). Significantly lower predicted concentrations of all opioids studied were associated with multiple opioid vs. single opioid presence, with predicted concentration reductions ranging from 13.7% for fentanyl to 65-66% for hydrocodone and oxycodone. Benzodiazepine presence was associated with small, non-statistically significant changes in opioid concentrations, while stimulant presence was associated with statistically significant reductions in hydrocodone and oxycodone concentrations. Co-ingestion of alcohol, multiple opioids or stimulants were associated with significantly decreased predicted concentrations of commonly identified opioids in drug deaths. Further evidence is provided for enhanced risks from polysubstance use with opioids, which has important public health implications.","Accounting;Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Blood;Blood Alcohol Content;Body Mass Index;Cardiovascular Diseases;Central Nervous System Stimulants;Coroners and Medical Examiners;Death;Demography;Female;Fentanyl;Forensic Toxicology;Humans;Hydrocodone;Ingestion;Linear Models;Linear Regression;Lung Diseases;Male;Methadone;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Risk;Substance-Related Disorders;United States;West Virginia",Cardiovascular Diseases;Death;Lung Diseases;Substance-Related Disorders,Forensic Sci Int,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32622507,2020,Surgeon experience and opioid prescribing.,"We evaluated the effects of surgeon characteristics such as surgeon experience on differences in opioid prescribing after surgery. We evaluated a 20% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years old who underwent 15 different types of surgery to identify surgeon characteristics associated with opioid prescription size filled within seven days of discharge using a multi-level linear model. 174,141 patients and 13,828 surgeons met inclusion criteria. 53.8% of patients filled an opioid prescription within seven days postoperatively. The amount of opioids prescribed after surgery was highest for patients whose surgeons were early in practice (i.e. 0-7 years in practice). Surgeon credentials, type of surgery, and geographic region were associated with differing sizes of opioid fills postoperatively. Surgeon characteristics such as cumulative years of practice contribute to differences in prescribing behavior after surgery. These findings can help develop strategic interventions to enhance opioid stewardship.","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Drug Prescriptions;Female;General Surgery;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Medicare;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Time Factors","Pain, Postoperative",Am J Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32657943,2022,Post-discharge Opioid Consumption After Minimally Invasive and Open Colectomy: Does Operative Approach Matter?,"To determine if patients consume less opioid after minimally invasive colectomy compared to open colectomy. Opioids are overprescribed after surgery, and surgeons are under increasing pressure to reduce postoperative opioid prescribing. In colorectal surgery, minimally invasive approaches are partly justified by reduced inpatient opioid use, but there are no studies comparing post-discharge opioid consumption between minimally invasive and open colectomy. This was a retrospective observational study of adult patients undergoing colectomy from January 2017 to May 2018 in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative database. After postoperative day 30, patients were contacted by phone or email and asked to report post-discharge opioid consumption. The main outcome measure was post-discharge opioid consumption, and the primary predictor was surgical approach (minimally invasive vs open). Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was used to test for an association between surgical approach and opioid consumption. We identified 562 patients who underwent minimally invasive or open colectomy from 43 hospitals. After multivariable adjustment, no significant difference was demonstrated in opioid consumption (P = 0.54) or the likelihood of using no opioids (P = 0.39) between patients undergoing minimally versus open colectomy. Larger prescriptions were associated with more opioid use and a lower likelihood of using no opioids. Age greater than 65 and diagnosis of cancer/adenoma were associated with less opioid use. Patients undergoing minimally invasive and open colectomy consume similar amounts of opioid after discharge. The size of the postoperative prescription, patient age, and diagnosis are more important in determining opioid use. Understanding factors influencing postoperative opioid requirements may allow surgeons to better tailor prescriptions to patient needs.","Adenoma;Adjustment;Adult;Aftercare;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cancer;Colectomy;Colorectal Surgery;Comprehension;Consumption;Database;Diagnosis;Electronic Mail;General Surgery;Hospitals;Humans;Inpatients;Michigan;Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures;Needs;Observational Study;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Discharge;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Pressure;Regression Analysis;Report;Retrospective Studies;Surgeons","Adenoma;Cancer;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32675543,2020,Care Coordination for Patients on Chronic Opioid Therapy Following Surgery: A Cohort Study.,"To describe if patients with chronic opioid use with a consistent usual prescriber (UP) prior to surgery and if early return to that UP (&lt;30 d) would be associated with fewer high risk prescribing events in the postoperative period. Over 10 million people each year are prescribed opioids for chronic pain. There is little evidence regarding coordination of opioid management and best practices for patients on long-term opioid therapy patients following surgery. The study design is a retrospective cohort study. We identified 5749 commercially insured patients aged 18 to 64 with chronic opioid use who underwent elective surgery between January 2008 and March 2015. The predictors were presence of a UP and early return (&lt;30 d from surgery) to a UP. The primary outcome was new high-risk opioid prescribing in the 90-day postoperative period (multiple prescribers, overlapping opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescriptions, new long acting opioid prescriptions, or new dose escalations to &gt; 100 mg OME). In this cohort, 73.8% of patients were exposed to high risk prescribing postoperatively. Overall, 10% of patients did not have a UP preoperatively, and were more likely to have prescriptions from multiple prescribers (OR 2.23 95% CI 1.75-2.83) and new long acting opioid prescriptions (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05-2.71). Among patients with a UP, earlier return was associated with decreased odds of receiving prescriptions from multiple prescribers (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95). Patients without a UP prior to surgery are more likely to be exposed to high-risk opioid prescribing following surgery. Among patients who have a UP, early return visits may enhance care coordination with fewer prescribers.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Best Practices;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Drug Utilization;Female;Follow-Up Studies;General Surgery;Humans;Incidence;Logistic Models;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;News;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Care Team;Patients;Persons;Postoperative Period;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Predictive Value of Tests;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Assessment;Severity of Illness Index;Sex Factors;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Therapeutics;Young Adult","Chronic Pain;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32678452,2020,Effect of Inhaled Cannabis for Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic pain and episodic acute pain caused by vasoocclusive crises, often requiring high doses of opioids for prolonged periods. In humanized mouse models of SCD, a synthetic cannabinoid has been found to attenuate both chronic and acute hyperalgesia. The effect of cannabis on chronic pain in adults with SCD is unknown. To determine whether inhaled cannabis is more effective than inhaled placebo in relieving chronic pain in adults with SCD. This pilot randomized clinical trial included participants with SCD with chronic pain admitted to a single inpatient clinical research center for 2 separate 5-day stays from August 2014 to April 2017. Participants inhaled either vaporized cannabis (4.4% Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) 3 times daily or vaporized placebo cannabis. Pain and pain interference ratings using the Brief Pain Inventory were assessed throughout each 5-day period. Participants with SCD and chronic pain on stable analgesics were eligible to enroll. A total of 90 participants were assessed for eligibility; 56 participants were deemed ineligible, and 34 participants were enrolled. Of these, 7 participants dropped out before randomization. Of 27 randomized participants, 23 completed both treatment arms of the crossover study and were included in the final per protocol analysis. Data analysis was completed in June 2019, with the sensitivity analysis conducted in April 2020. Inhalation of vaporized cannabis plant (4.4% Δ-9-tetrahydrocannbinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) or placebo cannabis plant using a vaporizer 3 times daily for 5 days. Daily pain assessed with visual analog scale and Brief Pain Inventory. A total of 23 participants (mean [SD] age, 37.6 [11.4] years; 13 [56%] women) completed the trial. The mean (SD) difference in pain rating assessment between the cannabis and placebo groups was -5.3 (8.1) for day 1, -10.9 (7.0) for day 2, -16.5 (9.2) for day 3, -8.9 (6.7) for day 4, and -8.2 (8.1) for day 5; however, none of these differences were statistically significant. There was no statistically significant mean (SD) difference in pain interference ratings between cannabis and placebo between days 1 and 5 for interference in general activities (day 1: 0.27 [0.35]; day 5: -1.0 [0.5]), walking (day 1: 0.14 [0.73]; day 5: -0.87 [0.63]), sleep (day 1: 0.59 [0.74]; day 5: -1.3 [0.8]), or enjoyment (day 1: 0.23 [0.69]; day 5: -0.91 [0.48]), but there was a statistically significant mean (SD) difference in decrease in interference with mood (day 1: 0.96 [0.59]; day 5: -1.4 [0.6]; P = .02). No differences in treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Use of concomitant opioids was similar during both treatment periods. This randomized clinical trial found that, compared with vaporized placebo, vaporized cannabis did not statistically significantly reduce pain and associated symptoms, except interference in mood, in patients with SCD with chronic pain.

32741501,2020,Something to despair: Gender differences in adverse childhood experiences among rural patients.,"Existing research has demonstrated that patients in treatment for an opioid use disorder (OUD) have high rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) compared to community-based samples. While research has documented important gender differences in ACEs in patients with OUD receiving treatment in urban areas, research has not shown whether these findings would generalize to rural and Appalachian areas, which are known to have lower ACE scores. We conducted a secondary analysis of existing clinical data, utilizing intake assessment data from a rural Appalachian outpatient buprenorphine program. We restricted the sample to patients with an OUD who presented for treatment between June 2018 and June 2019 (n = 173). The clinical intake assessment included a modified 17-item ACE instrument that patients self-administered. More than half (54.3%) of patients reported having experienced 4+ categories of adverse childhood experiences. On average, females endorsed 4.5 categories of adverse experiences, whereas males endorsed 3.3 (p &lt; 0.00); female patients were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse (42.4% versus 10.6%, p &lt; 0.00). Alarmingly, 25.9% of females and 8.2% of males reported being forced to have sex before age 18. Disproportionately high rates of childhood adversities, particularly among females, may partially explain despair in rural Appalachian areas.

We describe the adaptation of the first large pragmatic randomized controlled trial of the Whole Health model for chronic pain care for diverse VA clinical settings. Informed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Systems implementation framework, we conducted qualitative semistructured interviews to obtain feedback on trial design from VA leadership, frontline clinicians, and veterans with chronic pain at 5 VA enrollment sites. Next, we convened in-person evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) meetings with study stakeholders (including frontline clinicians and administrators) at each site to discuss study design; review interview themes; and identify site-specific barriers, facilitators, and approaches to implementation. Ethnographic observations from EBQI meetings provided additional insight into implementation strategies. Seventy-four veteran and VA staff stakeholders were interviewed; 71 stakeholders participated in EBQI meetings. At each site, unique clinical contexts and varying resources for Whole Health and pain care delivery affected plans for trial implementation. We present examples of local adaptations that emerged through the formative evaluation process to facilitate implementation and yield a more pragmatic trial design. A systematic formative evaluation can facilitate engagement and buy-in of study stakeholders. Locally tailored pragmatic implementation strategies may improve the likelihood of successful trial execution as well as future implementation of evidence-based pain care approaches in real-world clinical settings.","Administrators;Anthropology, Cultural;Attitude of Health Personnel;Chronic Pain;Classification;Evidence-Based Medicine;Feedback;Future;Health;Health Care;Humans;Integrative Medicine;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Leadership;Observation;Pain;Patient Selection;Persons;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Quality Improvement;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Research Design;Resources;Review;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health",Chronic Pain;Pain,Med Care,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32829884,2020,Evaluation of racial disparities in postoperative opioid prescription filling after common pediatric surgical procedures.,"Racially disparate pain management affects both adult and pediatric patients, but is not well studied among pediatric surgical patients after discharge. The objectives were to evaluate racial disparities in pediatric postoperative opioid prescription filling. This retrospective cohort study included black or white pediatric Medicaid patients who underwent tonsillectomy, supracondylar humeral fracture fixation, or appendectomy (2/2012-7/2016). Patients were followed for 14 days post-surgery to identify opioid prescription fills. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between race and the probability of filling an opioid prescription. Among 39,316 surgical patients, the proportions of patients with post-surgical opioid prescriptions were 66.0%, 83.9%, and 68.5%, among tonsillectomy, supracondylar fracture, and appendectomy patients, respectively. The proportion of black appendectomy patients with a postoperative opioid prescription was significantly lower compared to white patients (65.0% vs. 69.2% respectively, p = 0.03), but was no longer significant after adjusting for other patient and provider characteristics. There were no differences by race in opioid prescription filling among other surgical patient groups. The present study did not identify racial disparities in opioid prescription filling in adjusted analyses. Racial differences in unadjusted postoperative opioid prescription filling among appendectomy patients may be explained in part by longer postoperative length-of-stay among black children.

A state-wide naloxone distribution effort of 8250 rescue kits was undertaken by government, community and university partners in West Virginia in 2016-2017. The purpose of this study was to discern the barriers, facilitators and lesson learnt from implementing this endeavour in a rural state with the highest opioid overdose fatality rate in the US. Structured interviews (n=26) were conducted among both internal and external stakeholders. Those who participated were &gt;18 years of age and were the lead representative from agencies that either received naloxone (ie, external stakeholders) or helped implement the distribution (ie, internal stakeholders). The interviews followed standardised scripts and lasted approximately 40 min. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was performed by two researchers to determine themes surrounding facilitators or barriers to programme implementation. The primary facilitators reported by stakeholders included collaborative partnerships, ease of participating in the programme, being established in prevention efforts, demand for naloxone and the need for personal protection from overdose. The primary barriers identified by stakeholders included bureaucracy/policy/procedures of their organisation or agency, stigma, logistical or planning issues, problems with reporting, lack of communication post distribution and sustainability. Numerous lessons were learnt. Based on the implementation of the programme in 87 organisations, including law enforcement and fire departments, the impact of facilitators outweighed that of barriers.

32938775,2021,Assessment of a quality improvement intervention to decrease opioid prescribing in a regional health system.,"Opioids are prescribed in excess after surgery. We leveraged our continuous quality improvement infrastructure to implement opioid prescribing guidelines and subsequently evaluate changes in postoperative opioid prescribing, consumption and patient satisfaction/pain in a statewide regional health system. We collected data regarding postoperative prescription size, opioid consumption and patient-reported outcomes from February 2017 to May 2019, from a 70-hospital surgical collaborative. Three iterations of prescribing guidelines were released. An interrupted time series analysis before and after each guideline release was performed. Linear regression was used to identify trends in consumption and patient-reported outcomes over time. We included 36 022 patients from 69 hospitals who underwent one of nine procedures in the guidelines, of which 15 174 (37.3%) had complete patient-reported outcomes data following surgery. Before the intervention, prescription size was decreasing over time (slope: -0.7 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone/month, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.5 tablets, p&lt;0.001). After the first guideline release, prescription size declined by -1.4 tablets/month (95% CI -1.8 to -1.0 tablets, p&lt;0.001). The difference between these slopes was significant (p=0.006). The second guideline release resulted in a relative increase in slope (-0.3 tablets/month, 95% CI -0.1 to -0.6, p&lt;0.001). The third guideline release resulted in no change (p=0.563 for the intervention). Overall, mean (SD) prescription size decreased from 25 (17) tablets of 5 mg oxycodone to 12 (8) tablets. Opioid consumption also decreased from 11 (16) to 5 (7) tablets (p&lt;0.001), while satisfaction and postoperative pain remained unchanged. The use of procedure-specific prescribing guidelines reduced statewide postoperative opioid prescribing by 50% while providing satisfactory pain care. These results demonstrate meaningful impact on opioid prescribing using evidence-based best practices and serve as an example of successful utilisation of a regional health collaborative for quality improvement.","Analgesics, Opioid;Best Practices;Clinical Practice Guideline;Consumption;General Surgery;Guideline;Health;Health Policy;Hospitals;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Linear Regression;Opioids;Overall;Oxycodone;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Quality Improvement;Relatives;Satisfaction;Tablets;Time","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",BMJ Qual Saf,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate alterations in amygdalar functional connectivity in human infants with prenatal opioid exposure. In this prospective IRB approved study, we performed resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in 10 infants with prenatal opioid exposure and 12 infants without prenatal drug exposure at &lt; 48 weeks corrected gestational age. Following standard preprocessing, we performed seed-based functional connectivity analysis with the right and left amygdala as the regions of interest after correcting for maternal depression and infant sex. We compared functional connectivity of the amygdala network between infants with and without prenatal opioid exposure. There were significant differences in connectivity of the amygdala seed regions to the several cortical regions including the medial prefrontal cortex in infants who had prenatal opioid exposure when compared with opioid naïve infants. This finding of increased amygdala functional connectivity in infants with in utero opioid exposure suggests a potential role of maternal opioid exposure on infants' altered amygdala function. This association with prenatal exposure needs to be replicated in future larger studies.","Amygdala;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Brain;Depression;Ethics Committees, Research;Female;Future;Gestational Age;Humans;Infant;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Neural Pathways;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Prefrontal Cortex;Pregnancy;Prospective Studies;Role;Seeds;Sex;Standards;fMRI",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,Neuroradiology,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,

Many evidence-based modalities for the prevention and treatment of back pain closely mirror recommendations for weight loss and include physical activity and health maintenance activities (PAHM). The primary aim of this study was to ascertain community assets, and perceptions of the use of PAHM in the treatment of back pain by West Virginia Physical Activity Network (WVPAN) members. Participants for the study were recruited from the West Virginia Physical Activity Network. This grassroots organization is filled with volunteers from various sectors who were recruited from various workshops, conferences, or coalition meetings over a period of several years. This network was purposely selected as the study population because of the statewide reach and their familiarity with resources in their local communities. A brief survey instrument was designed to gather their scaled perceptions about various treatment modalities related to back pain, and to gather their local knowledge related to specific providers in their communities. In addition, participants were given a free text box to list any local assets or resources for the nine treatments listed, and county of residence, and the nature of their connection to the physical activity network. Descriptive analyses were used to describe overall patterns of survey data. The qualitative data were compiled manually by the research team to show themes of specific treatments mentioned across different parts of the state. Participants overwhelmingly supported physical therapy, flexibility training, yoga, and core strengthening as treatments for back pain. The majority of respondents were ""undecided"" about other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapies and acupuncture. The implementation of PAHM interventions in communities could help treat patients with back pain, and may reduce reliance on the pharmacological treatment for back pain. The current study's data support the potential of such approaches in many West Virginia counties. Also, local resources, and context can be gleaned from community leader surveys utilizing previously developed infrastructure for PAHM promotion.",Acupuncture;Back Pain;Body Mass Index;Capacity Building;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Community;Conferences;Exercise;Expenditures;Familiarity;Health;Health Care;Health Resources;Humans;Knowledge;Maintenance;Nature;Organizations;Overall;Patients;Perception;Physical Therapy;Physical Therapy Modalities;Pliability;Population;Research;Resources;Respondents;Rural Health;Surveys;Therapeutics;Volunteers;Weight Loss;West Virginia;Workshops;Yoga,Back Pain;Weight Loss,BMC Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33065196,2021,"Neuroimaging in infants with prenatal opioid exposure: Current evidence, recent developments and targets for future research.","Prenatal opioid exposure (POE) has shown to be a risk factor for adverse long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes in offspring. However, the neural mechanisms of these outcomes remain poorly understood. While preclinical and human studies suggest that these outcomes may be due to opioid-mediated changes in the fetal and early postnatal brain, other maternal, social, and environmental factors are also shown to play a role. Recent neuroimaging studies reveal brain alterations in children with POE. Early neuroimaging and novel methodology could provide an in vivo mechanistic understanding of opioid mediated alterations in developing brain. However, this is an area of ongoing research. In this review we explore recent imaging developments in POE, with emphasis on the neonatal and infant brain, and highlight some of the challenges of imaging the developing brain in this population. We also highlight evidence from animal models and imaging in older children and youth to understand areas where future research may be targeted in infants with POE.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Brain;Child;Comprehension;Female;Future;Humans;Infant;Longitudinal Studies;Models, Animal;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Neuroimaging;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Play;Population;Pregnancy;Research;Review;Risk Factors;Role;Youth",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder,J Neuroradiol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
33065653,2022,New Persistent Opioid Use After Inguinal Hernia Repair.,"To describe the incidence of new persistent opioid use after inguinal hernia repair as well as its associated risk factors. The development of new persistent opioid use after surgery is a common complication; however, its incidence following inguinal hernia repair has not been described. Given that roughly 800,000 inguinal hernia repairs are performed annually in the USA, any incidence could have profound implications for patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study of the incidence of new persistent opioid use after inguinal hernia repair using a national database of de-identified administrative health claims of opioid-naïve patients undergoing surgery from 2008 to 2016. During the study period, 59,795 opioid-naïve patients underwent inguinal hernia repair and met inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) age was 57.8 (16.1) years and 55,014 (92%) patients were male. Nine hundred twenty-two (1.5%) patients continued filling opioids prescriptions for at least 3 months after surgery. The most significant risk factor for developing new persistent opioid use after surgery was filling an opioid prescription in the 30 days before surgery (odds ratio 4.34, 95% confidence interval 3.75-5.01). These prescriptions were provided by surgeons in 52% of cases and primary care physicians in 16% of cases. Other risk factors for new persistent opioid use included receiving a larger opioid prescription, having more comorbidities, having a major postoperative complication, and certain mental health disorders and pain disorders. After undergoing inguinal hernia repair, 1.5% of patients developed new persistent opioid use. Filling an opioid prescription in the 30 days before surgery had the strongest association with this complication.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Female;General Surgery;Health;Hernia, Inguinal;Humans;Incidence;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain Disorder;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Physicians, Primary Care;Postoperative Complications;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Surgeons","Hernia, Inguinal;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain Disorder;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

33111385,2021,Disparities in neonatal abstinence syndrome and health insurance status: A statewide study using non-claims real-time surveillance data.,"Most studies examining the relationship between neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and health insurance status in the United States (USA) have used administrative insurance claims data, which is subject to myriad limitations. We examined the association between NAS and health insurance status in a large geographically defined rural population in the United States, using non-claims data. We utilized data from a population-based cohort of all newborns born in 2017-2019 in the rural state of West Virginia (WV) and restricted analyses to WV residents' births (n = 46 213). NAS was defined as neonatal withdrawal from many substances, including opiates and not limited to those cases that require pharmacological treatment. Medicaid covered more than half (52.6%) of all infants' births in the state of WV. The incidence of NAS was 85.8 and 12.7 per 1000 livebirths in the Medicaid and privately insured groups, respectively. Among all infants diagnosed with NAS, 86.1% were enrolled in the state's Medicaid programme. The risk of NAS in the Medicaid-insured newborns was higher than privately insured newborns in the unadjusted analysis (risk ratio (RR) 6.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.95, 7.68) and the adjusted analysis RR 3.00, 95% CI 2.01, 4.49); adjusted risk difference 20.3 (95% CI 17.5, 23.1 cases per 1000 livebirths). NAS is an important indicator of the immediate effect of the opioid crisis. This study shows the disparity in NAS by health insurance status for a large rural population in the United States, and its burden on the state's Medicaid programme. Providing timely and accurate estimates of NAS is important for public health policies and decision making.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Child, Preschool;Confidence Intervals;Decision Making;Humans;Incidence;Indicators;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Insurance;Insurance, Health;Medicaid;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid Crisis;Parturition;Policy;Population;Program;Public Health;Risk;Risk Analysis;Rural Population;Therapeutics;Time;United States;West Virginia",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33125747,2021,Opioid prescribing exceeds consumption following common surgical oncology procedures.,"Surgical oncology patients are vulnerable to persistent opioid use. As such, we aim to compare opioid prescribing to opioid consumption for common surgical oncology procedures. We prospectively identified patients undergoing common surgical oncology procedures at a single academic institution (August 2017-March 2018). Patients were contacted by telephone within 6 months of surgery and asked to report their opioid consumption and describe their discharge instructions and opioid handling practices. Of the 439 patients who were approached via telephone, 270 completed at least one survey portion. The median quantity of opioid prescribed was significantly larger than consumed following breast biopsy (5 vs. 2 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone, p &lt; .001), lumpectomy (10 vs. 2 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone, p &lt; .001), and mastectomy or wide local excision (20 tablets vs. 2 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone, p &lt; .001). The majority of patients reported receiving education on taking opioids, but only 27% received instructions on proper disposal; 82% of prescriptions filled resulted in unused opioids, and only 11% of these patients safely disposed of them. This study demonstrates that opioid prescribing exceeds consumption following common surgical oncology procedures, indicating the potential for reductions in prescribing.","Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Biopsy;Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Consumption;Drug Prescriptions;Education;Female;Follow-Up Studies;General Surgery;Humans;Instruction;Lumpectomy;Mastectomy;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Discharge;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Prognosis;Prospective Studies;Report;Surgical Oncology;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Tablets;Telephone","Breast Neoplasms;Pain, Postoperative",J Surg Oncol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

33232379,2020,Predicting who responds to spinal manipulative therapy using a short-time frame methodology: Results from a 238-participant study.,"Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is among the nonpharmacologic interventions that has been recommended in clinical guidelines for patients with low back pain, however, some patients appear to benefit substantially more from SMT than others. Several investigations have examined potential factors to modify patients' responses prior to SMT application. The objective of this study was to determine if the baseline prediction of SMT responders can be improved through the use of a restricted, non-pragmatic methodology, established variables of responder status, and newly developed physical measures observed to change with SMT. We conducted a secondary analysis of a prior study that provided two applications of standardized SMT over a period of 1 week. After initial exploratory analysis, principal component analysis and optimal scaling analysis were used to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. A multiple logistic regression model was built using a forward Wald procedure to explore those baseline variables that could predict response status at 1-week reassessment. Two hundred and thirty-eight participants completed the 1-week reassessment (age 40.0± 11.8 years; 59.7% female). Response to treatment was predicted by a model containing the following 8 variables: height, gender, neck or upper back pain, pain frequency in the past 6 months, the STarT Back Tool, patients' expectations about medication and strengthening exercises, and extension status. Our model had a sensitivity of 72.2% (95% CI, 58.1-83.1), specificity of 84.2% (95% CI, 78.0-89.0), a positive likelihood ratio of 4.6 (CI, 3.2-6.7), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.3 (CI, 0.2-0.5), and area under ROC curve, 0.79. It is possible to predict response to treatment before application of SMT in low back pain patients. Our model may benefit both patients and clinicians by reducing the time needed to re-evaluate an initial trial of care.","Adolescent;Adult;Back;Back Pain;Chiropractic;Clinical Practice Guideline;Exercise;Expectations;Female;Gender;Humans;Logistic Regression;Low Back Pain;Male;Manipulation Therapy;Manipulation, Spinal;Measures;Middle Aged;Neck;Pain;Patients;Principal Component Analysis;Procedures;Prognosis;ROC Curve;Sensitivity;Specificity;Spine;Sports Medicine;Therapeutics;Time;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Back Pain;Low Back Pain;Pain,PLoS One,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33276372,2021,Fentanyl Quality Assurance Project Prompted Change in Clinical Workflow and Test Configurations.,"Deaths attributable to fentanyl (FEN, a synthetic opioid) are high in Appalachia and highest in West Virginia. The goal of the study was to determine FEN prevalence among specimens submitted for definitive opioid testing and monitor responses to provider notifications of unexpected FEN findings during Q1 2020. All definitive opioid test data were reviewed daily for FEN signatures in Q1 2020. Unexpected FEN results were communicated to providers and monitored for 10 days to record actions taken. Prevalence data were categorized. Behavioral Medicine (BMED) leaders analyzed January data and implemented FEN screening in the clinic. BMED Q1 clinic visits and order volumes for drug screens were reviewed after Q1. FEN positivity was 11% in Q1; &gt;60% of findings were unexpected. Actions were taken for 54% of notifications in January but only 18% in March. Notifications required 70 hours of combined laboratory effort each month. BMED providers ordered 44% of definitive opioid tests and 69% of definitive FEN tests. Data prompted the addition of FEN to routine drug screen panels in the laboratory, and a 10% random FEN screening rate in the BMED opioid use disorder clinics (COAT). Prevalence of FEN positivity was higher than initially expected, even for this region in Appalachia. Expanded presence of FEN screening should assist BMED providers with clinical efforts and help identify patients in need of intervention/therapy.","Analgesics, Opioid;Appalachian Region;Behavioral Medicine;Clinic Visits;Death;Fentanyl;Goals;Humans;Laboratories;Mass Screening;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Records;Screening;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;West Virginia;Workflow",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,J Appl Lab Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33288211,2021,A national evaluation of opioid prescribing and persistent use after ambulatory anorectal surgery.,"Surgery is a common gateway to opioid-related morbidity. Ambulatory anorectal cases are common, with opioids widely prescribed, but there is limited data on their role in this crisis. We sought to determine prescribing trends, new persistent opioid use rates, and factors associated with new persistent opioid use after ambulatory anorectal procedures. The Optum Clinformatics claims database was analyzed for opioid-naïve adults undergoing outpatient hemorrhoid, fissure, or fistula procedures from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2017. The main outcome measure was the rate of new persistent opioid use after anorectal cases. Secondary outcomes were annual rates of perioperative opioid fills and the prescription size over time (oral morphine equivalents). A total of 23,426 cases were evaluated: 69.09% (n = 16,185) hemorrhoids, 24.29% (n = 5,690) fissures, and 6.45% (n = 1,512) fistulas. The annual rate of perioperative opioid fills decreased on average 1.2%/year, from 72% in 2010 to 66% in 2017 (P &lt; .001). Prescribing rates were consistently highest for fistulas, followed by hemorrhoids, then fissures (P &lt; .001). There was a significant reduction in prescription size (oral morphine equivalents) over the study period, with median oral morphine equivalents (interquartile range) of 280 (250-400) in 2010 and 225 (150-375) in 2017 (P &lt; .0001). Overall, 2.1% (n = 499) developed new persistent opioid use. Logistic regression found new persistent opioid use was associated with additional perioperative opioid fills (odds ratio 3.92; 95% confidence interval: 2.92-5.27; P &lt; .0001), increased comorbidity (odds ratio 1.15; confidence interval: 1.09-1.20; P &lt; .00001), tobacco use (odds ratio 1.79; confidence interval: 1.37-2.36; P &lt; .0001), and pain disorders (odds ratio, 1.49; confidence interval, 1.23-1.82); there was no significant association with procedure performed. Over 2% of ambulatory anorectal procedures develop new persistent opioid use. Despite small annual reductions in opioid prescriptions, there has been little change in the amount prescribed. This demonstrates a need to develop and disseminate best practices for anorectal surgery, focusing on eliminating unnecessary opioid prescribing.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Ambulatory Care;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Best Practices;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Database;Digestive System Surgical Procedures;Disease Management;Drug Prescriptions;Female;Fistula;General Surgery;Health Care Surveys;Hemorrhoids;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Morphine;Needs;News;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Outcome Measures;Outpatients;Overall;Pain Disorder;Pain, Postoperative;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Role;Time;Tobacco Use;United States;Young Adult","Fistula;Hemorrhoids;Pain Disorder;Pain, Postoperative",Surgery,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33308289,2020,Strategy for addressing research-site overlap in pragmatic clinical trials: lessons learned from the NIH-DOD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC).,"The Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) is a multi-site network of pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) focused on nonpharmacological approaches to pain management, conducted in health care systems of the US Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and co-funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Concerns about potential research-site overlap prompted the PMC investigator community to consider strategies to avert this problem that could negatively affect recruitment and contaminate interventions and thus pose a threat to trial integrity. We developed a two-step strategy to identify and remediate research-site overlap by obtaining detailed recruitment plans across all PMC PCTs that addressed eligibility criteria, recruitment methods, trial settings, and timeframes. The first, information-gathering phase consisted of a 2-month period for data collection from PIs, stakeholders, and ClinicalTrials.gov . The second, remediation phase consisted of a series of moderated conference calls over a 1-month time period to develop plans to address overlap. Remediation efforts focused on exclusion criteria and recruitment strategies, and they involved collaboration with sponsors and stakeholder groups such as the Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC). The MTFEC is comprised of collaborating DoD and university-affiliated PIs, clinicians, and educators devoted to facilitating successful pragmatic trials in DoD settings. Of 61 recruitment sites for the 11 PMC PCTs, 17 (28%) overlapped. Four PCTs had five overlapping Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), and eight PCTs had 12 overlapping VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). We developed three general strategies to avoid research-site overlap: (i) modify exclusion criteria, (ii) coordinate recruitment efforts, and/or (iii) replace or avoid any overlapping sites. Potential overlap from competing studies outside of the PMC was apparent at 26 sites, but we were not able to confirm them as true conflicts. Proactive strategies can be used to resolve the issue of overlapping research sites in the PMC. These strategies, combined with open and impartial mediation approaches that include researchers, sponsors, and stakeholders, provide lessons learned from this large and complex pragmatic research effort.",Address;Affect;Community;Conferences;Data Collection;Delivery of Health Care;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Humans;Methods;Military Personnel;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Negotiating;Pain Management;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Research;Research Personnel;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Universities;Veterans,Pain,Trials,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33309783,2021,Optimization of Spinal Manipulative Therapy Protocols: A Factorial Randomized Trial Within a Multiphase Optimization Framework.,"Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is a common nonpharmacological treatment for low back pain (LBP). Although generally supported by systematic reviews and practice guidelines, clinical trials evaluating SMT have been characterized by small effect sizes. This study adopts a Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework to examine individual components of an SMT delivery protocol using a single-blind trial with the goal of identifying and optimizing a multicomponent SMT protocol. We enrolled 241 participants with LBP. All participants received 2 SMT treatment sessions in the first week then were randomly assigned additional treatment based on a fully factorial design. The 3 randomized treatment components provided in twice weekly sessions over 3 weeks were multifidus activating exercise, spinal mobilizing exercise, and additional SMT dose. Primary outcomes included clinical (Oswestry Disability Index, numeric pain intensity rating) and mechanistic (spinal stiffness, multifidus muscle activation) measures assessed at baseline, 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Significant differences were found for the Oswestry index after 12 weeks for participants receiving multifidus activating exercise (mean difference = -3.62, 97.5% CI: -6.89, -0.35; P= .01). There were no additional significant main or interaction effects for other treatment components or different outcome measures. The optimized SMT protocol identified in this study included SMT sessions followed by multifidus activating exercises. PERSPECTIVE: Optimizing the effects of nonpharmacological treatments such as SMT for LBP is challenging due to uncertainty regarding mechanisms and the complexity of multicomponent protocols. This factorial randomized trial examined SMT protocols provided with differing co-interventions with mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes. Patient-centered outcomes were optimized by inclusion of lumbar multifidus strengthening exercises.","Adult;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trial;Exercise;Female;Goals;Humans;Index;Low Back Pain;Male;Manipulation Therapy;Manipulation, Spinal;Measures;Middle Aged;Multifidus;Muscles;Outcome Measures;Pain;Patient Outcome Assessment;Patients;Practice Guideline;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Uncertainty",Low Back Pain;Pain,J Pain,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313725,2020,Targeting Chronic Pain in Primary Care Settings by Using Behavioral Health Consultants: Methods of a Randomized Pragmatic Trial.,"Manualized cognitive and behavioral therapies are increasingly used in primary care environments to improve nonpharmacological pain management. The Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (BCBT-CP) intervention, recently implemented by the Defense Health Agency for use across the military health system, is a modular, primary care-based treatment program delivered by behavioral health consultants integrated into primary care for patients experiencing chronic pain. Although early data suggest that this intervention improves functioning, it is unclear whether the benefits of BCBT-CP are sustained. The purpose of this paper is to describe the methods of a pragmatic clinical trial designed to test the effect of monthly telehealth booster contacts on treatment retention and long-term clinical outcomes for BCBT-CP treatment, as compared with BCBT-CP without a booster, in 716 Defense Health Agency beneficiaries with chronic pain. A randomized pragmatic clinical trial will be used to examine whether telehealth booster contacts improve outcomes associated with BCBT-CP treatments. Monthly booster contacts will reinforce BCBT-CP concepts and the home practice plan. Outcomes will be assessed 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the first appointment for BCBT-CP. Focus groups will be conducted to assess the usability, perceived effectiveness, and helpfulness of the booster contacts. Most individuals with chronic pain are managed in primary care, but few are offered biopsychosocial approaches to care. This pragmatic brief trial will test whether a pragmatic enhancement to routine clinical care, monthly booster contacts, results in sustained functional changes among patients with chronic pain receiving BCBT-CP in primary care.",Appointments;Chronic Pain;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Consultants;Environment;Focus Groups;Health;Humans;Methods;Military Health Services;Pain Management;Paper;Patients;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Primary Health Care;Program;Telehealth;Therapeutics,Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313727,2020,Designing Trials with Purpose: Pragmatic Clinical Trials of Nonpharmacological Approaches for Pain Management.,"Pain is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and disability worldwide. The efficacy of several nonpharmacological approaches for pain management has been established, but significant gaps exist between this evidence and their limited availability and use in routine clinical practice. Questions remain about their effectiveness and how best to integrate them in usual care to optimize patient-centered outcomes. Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) may help address this gap. Informed by the Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2), we sought to describe the key features of optimized PCTs of nonpharmacological approaches for the management of pain and common co-occurring conditions. To accomplish this objective, we searched the published literature on PCTs of nonpharmacological pain management approaches from 2010-2019 and applied the PRECIS-2 criteria. We discuss key PRECIS-2 domains of interest for designing and performing PCTs and cite specific examples from the published literature as potential models for future PCTs. We found 13 nonpharmacological PCTs. They were heterogeneous in size, recruitment, follow-up time, and location. The lessons learned from these studies led us to explicate key features of trials on the explanatory-pragmatic continuum across the PRECIS-2 domains that can be used by future investigators when designing their clinical trials of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management. We encourage the increased application of PCTs to produce timely and valuable results and products that will inform the development of safe and effective integrated pain care plans that optimize important patient-centered outcomes.",Address;Clinical Trial;Future;Humans;Indicators;Literature;Morbidity;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Research Design;Research Personnel;Time,Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

This is an encouraging development; however, what constitutes best practice for nonpharmacologic management of low back pain (LBP) is largely unknown. The Improving Veteran Access to Integrated Management of Back Pain (AIM-Back) trial is an embedded pragmatic cluster-randomized trial that will examine the effectiveness of two different care pathways for LBP. Sixteen primary care clinics will be randomized 1:1 to receive training in delivery of 1) an integrated sequenced-care pathway or 2) a coordinated pain navigator pathway. Primary outcomes are pain interference and physical function (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form [PROMIS-SF]) collected in the electronic health record at 3 months (n=1,680). A subset of veteran participants (n=848) have consented to complete additional surveys at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months for supplementary pain and other measures. AIM-Back care pathways will be tested for effectiveness, and treatment heterogeneity will be investigated to identify which veterans may respond best to a given pathway. Health care utilization patterns (including opioid use) will also be compared between care pathways. Therefore, the AIM-Back trial will provide important information that can inform the future delivery of nonpharmacologic treatment of LBP.",Back;Back Pain;Best Practices;Electronic Health Records;Form;Future;Humans;Information Systems;Low Back Pain;Measures;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient Reported Outcomes;Primary Health Care;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Research;Scales;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Time Factors;Veterans,Back Pain;Low Back Pain;Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313729,2020,Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation: A Pragmatic Effectiveness Trial of a Nonpharmacologic Alternative for the Treatment of Postoperative Pain.,"Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is an analgesic modality involving the insertion of a lead through an introducer needle followed by the delivery of electric current after needle withdrawal. This modality has been used extensively to treat chronic pain, but only small series have been published involving postoperative pain. The ultimate objective of this study is to determine the postoperative effects of percutaneous PNS following moderately to severely painful ambulatory surgery within a real-world clinical practice setting. The primary hypothesis is that surgical pain and opioid consumption during the initial 7 days after surgery will be reduced by percutaneous PNS compared with usual and customary analgesia (dual primary outcome measures). A multicenter pragmatic effectiveness trial. We are randomizing participants having painful orthopedic surgical procedures of the upper and lower extremity to receive 14 days of either 1) electrical stimulation or 2) sham in a double-masked fashion. End points are being assessed at various time points over 12 postoperative months. The postoperative experience will be much improved if percutaneous PNS provides potent analgesia while concurrently decreasing opioid requirements following painful surgery. Because this modality can be administered for up to 60 days at home, it may provide postoperative analgesia that outlasts surgical pain yet has relatively few risks and, unlike opioids, has no systemic side effects or potential for abuse, addiction, and overdose. Percutaneous PNS has the potential to revolutionize postoperative analgesia as it has been practiced for the past century. This study will inform key stakeholders regarding an evidence-based nonpharmacologic approach to the management of postoperative pain.","Ambulatory Surgical Procedures;Analgesia;Analgesics;Chronic Pain;Consumption;Electric Stimulation;General Surgery;Humans;Lead;Lower Extremity;Needles;Opioids;Orthopedic Surgical Procedures;Outcome Measures;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Peripheral Nerves;Risk;Therapeutics;Time;Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography, Interventional","Chronic Pain;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313730,2020,Learning to Apply Mindfulness to Pain (LAMP): Design for a Pragmatic Clinical Trial of Two Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Chronic Pain.,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments for treating chronic pain. However, the predominant MBI, mindfulness-based stress reduction, has features that pose significant implementation barriers. This study will test two approaches to delivering MBIs for improving Veterans' chronic pain and mental health comorbidities. These two approaches address key implementation barriers. We will conduct a four-site, three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Learning to Apply Mindfulness to Pain (LAMP), to test the effectiveness of two MBIs at improving pain and mental health comorbidities. Mobile+Group LAMP consists of prerecorded modules presented by a mindfulness instructor that are viewed in an online group setting and interspersed with discussions led by a facilitator. Mobile LAMP consists of the same prerecorded modules but does not include a group component. We will test whether either of these MBIs will be more effective than usual care at improving chronic pain and whether the Mobile+Group LAMP will be more effective than Mobile LAMP at improving chronic pain. Comparisons for the primary hypotheses will be conducted with continuous outcomes (Brief Pain Inventory interference score) repeated at 10 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. The secondary hypotheses are that Mobile+Group LAMP and Mobile LAMP will be more effective than usual care at improving secondary outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression). We will also confirm the comparisons for the primary and secondary hypotheses in gender-specific strata. This trial is expected to result in two approaches for delivering MBIs that will optimize engagement, adherence, and sustainability and be able to reach large numbers of Veterans.","AT 10;Address;Arm;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Depression;Gender;Humans;Inventories;Learning;Mental Health;Mindfulness;Pain;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Randomized Controlled Trial;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Veterans","Chronic Pain;Pain;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Department of Veterans Affairs compensation examinations, which determine the degree of disability and whether it was connected to military service, represent an opportunity to engage Veterans in pain management and substance use treatments. A multisite randomized clinical trial is testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) for Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal disorders. This telephone-based intervention is delivered through a hub-and-spoke configuration. This study is a two-arm, parallel-group, 36-week, multisite randomized controlled single-blind trial. It will randomize 1,100 Veterans experiencing pain and seeking service-connection for musculoskeletal disorders to either SBIRT-PM or usual care across eight New England VA medical centers. The study balances pragmatic with explanatory methodological features. Primary outcomes are pain severity and number of substances misused. Nonpharmacological pain management and substance use services utilization are tracked in the trial. Early trial enrollment targets were met across sites. SBIRT-PM could help Veterans, at the time of their compensation claims, use multimodal pain treatments and reduce existing substance misuse. Strategies to address COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the SBIRT-PM protocol have been developed to maintain its pragmatic and exploratory integrity.",Address;Adult;Arm;Brief Interventions;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Compensation;Cost Effectiveness;Crisis Intervention;Female;Humans;Male;Mass Screening;Military Personnel;Musculoskeletal Diseases;New England;Pain;Pain Management;Pensions;Referral;Risk;SARS-CoV-2;Screening;Services Utilization;Single-Blind Method;Substance Use;Telephone;Therapeutics;Time;Veterans,COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Pain;Substance Use,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313732,2020,Veteran Response to Dosage in Chiropractic Therapy (VERDICT): Study Protocol of a Pragmatic Randomized Trial for Chronic Low Back Pain.,"Low back pain is a leading cause of disability in veterans. Chiropractic care is a well-integrated, nonpharmacological therapy in Veterans Affairs health care facilities, where doctors of chiropractic provide therapeutic interventions focused on the management of low back pain and other musculoskeletal conditions. However, important knowledge gaps remain regarding the effectiveness of chiropractic care in terms of the number and frequency of treatment visits needed for optimal outcomes in veterans with low back pain. This pragmatic, parallel-group randomized trial at four Veterans Affairs sites will include 766 veterans with chronic low back pain who are randomly allocated to a course of low-dose (one to five visits) or higher-dose (eight to 12 visits) chiropractic care for 10 weeks (Phase 1). After Phase 1, participants within each treatment arm will again be randomly allocated to receive either monthly chiropractic chronic pain management for 10 months or no scheduled chiropractic visits (Phase 2). Assessments will be collected electronically. The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire will be the primary outcome for Phase 1 at week 10 and Phase 2 at week 52. This trial will provide evidence to guide the chiropractic dose in an initial course of care and an extended-care approach for veterans with chronic low back pain. Accurate information on the effectiveness of different dosing regimens of chiropractic care can greatly assist health care facilities, including Veterans Affairs, in modeling the number of doctors of chiropractic that will best meet the needs of patients with chronic low back pain.","Arm;Chiropractic;Chronic Pain;Clinical Protocols;Health Care;Humans;Knowledge;Low Back Pain;Manipulation, Chiropractic;Needs;Pain Management;Patients;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Questionnaires;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Veterans",Chronic Pain;Low Back Pain;Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33313733,2020,Co-Operative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES) Expanding Treatment for Real-World Access (ExTRA): Pragmatic Trial Protocol.,"Given access barriers to cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP), this pragmatic superiority trial will determine whether a remotely delivered CBT-CP intervention that addresses these barriers outperforms in-person and other synchronous forms of CBT-CP for veterans with musculoskeletal pain. This pragmatic trial compares an asynchronous form of CBT-CP that uses interactive voice response (IVR) to allow patients to participate from their home (IVR CBT-CP) with synchronous CBT-CP delivered by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinician. Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4 months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed. This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior, resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take precedence when making referrals.

The WHT consists of a medical provider, a complementary and integrative health (CIH) provider, and a Whole Health coach, who collaborate with VA patients to create a Personalized Health Plan emphasizing CIH approaches to chronic pain management. The active comparator, PC-GE, is adapted group cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain. The first aim is to test whether the WHT approach is superior to PC-GE and whether both are superior to UPC in decreasing pain interference in functioning in 750 veterans with moderate to severe chronic pain (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include changes in pain severity, quality of life, mental health symptoms, and use of nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies for pain. Outcomes will be collected from the VA electronic health record and patient-reported data over 12 months of follow-up.

33313735,2020,Resolving the Burden of Low Back Pain in Military Service Members and Veterans (RESOLVE): Protocol for a Multisite Pragmatic Clinical Trial.,"Physical therapy (PT) is frequently used for the management of low back pain (LBP) within the US Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). However, variations in PT practice patterns and use of ineffective interventions lower the quality and increase the cost of care. Although adherence to the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can improve the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of LBP care, PT CPG adherence remains below 50%. The Resolving the Burden of Low Back Pain in Military Service Members and Veterans (RESOLVE) trial will evaluate the effectiveness of an active PT CPG implementation strategy using an education, audit, and feedback model for reducing pain, disability, medication use, and cost of LBP care within the DOD and VA health care systems. The RESOLVE trial will include 3,300 to 7,260 patients with LBP across three DOD and two VA medical facilities using a stepped-wedge study design. An education, audit, and feedback model will be used to encourage physical therapists to better adhere to the PT CPG recommendations. The Oswestry Disability Index and the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale will be used as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will include the LBP-related medication use, medical resource utilization, and biopsychosocial predictors of outcomes. Statistical analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle and will use linear mixed models to compare treatment conditions and examine the interactions between treatment and subgrouping status (e.g., limb loss).

33313736,2020,Assessing the Relative Effectiveness of Combining Self-Care with Practitioner-Delivered Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies to Improve Pain in a Pragmatic Trial.,"Many health care systems are beginning to encourage patients to use complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies for pain management. Many clinicians have anecdotally reported that patients combining self-care CIH therapies with practitioner-delivered therapies report larger health improvements than do patients using practitioner-delivered or self-care CIH therapies alone. However, we are unaware of any trials in this area. The APPROACH Study (Assessing Pain, Patient-Reported Outcomes and Complementary and Integrative Health) assesses the value of veterans participating in practitioner-delivered CIH therapies alone or self-care CIH therapies alone compared with the combination of self-care and practitioner-delivered care. The study is being conducted in 18 Veterans Health Administration sites that received funding as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to expand availability of CIH therapies. Practitioner-delivered therapies under study include chiropractic care, acupuncture, and therapeutic massage, and self-care therapies include tai chi/qi gong, yoga, and meditation. The primary outcome will be improvement on the Brief Pain Inventory 6 months after initiation of CIH as compared with baseline scores. Patients will enter treatment groups on the basis of the care they receive because randomizing patients to specific CIH therapies would require withholding therapies routinely offered at VA. We will address selection bias and confounding by using sites' variations in business practices and other encouragements to receive different types of CIH therapies as a surrogate for direct randomization by using instrumental variable econometrics methods. Real-world evidence about the value of combining self-care and practitioner-delivered CIH therapies from this pragmatic trial will help guide the VA and other health care systems in offering specific nonpharmacological approaches to manage patients' chronic pain.",Acupuncture;Address;Administration;Alternative Therapies;Business;Chiropractic;Chronic Pain;Complementary Therapies;Health;Health Care Systems;Humans;Inventories;Massage;Meditation;Methods;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Qigong;Random Allocation;Relatives;Report;Selection Bias;Self Care;Tai Ji;Therapeutics;Veterans;Veterans Health;Yoga,Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33324976,2021,Drug Positivity Findings from a Universal Umbilical Cord Tissue Drug Analysis Program in Appalachia.,"West Virginia has high rates of opioid-related health crises and deaths that extend to pregnant women and newborns. Our institutional screening approach has included universal umbilical cord tissue drug analysis (UCTDA) since 2013. The objective of this study was to retrospectively report incidence of in utero drug exposure using UCTDA data. Two sequential UCTDA data sets (October 2013 to September 2015, and October 2016 to September 2018) represent interrupted epochs given changes in interfaced data availability. UCTDA positivity (by drug class and parent drug) and numbers of drugs detected in each specimen were retrospectively analyzed. THC was removed from the analysis because of discontinuous testing, and 4 opioids were separated from the data set given the potential for both therapeutic and illicit use. UCTDA specimens that were positive for drugs (22% overall) decreased between Epochs 1 and 2, from 25% to 20%. Increased positivity was noted for hydrocodone (+407%), oxycodone (+240%), amphetamines (+506%), and cocaine (+417%). Fentanyl and morphine positivity decreased by 75% and 18%, respectively, whereas buprenorphine detection increased 195%. Most positive specimens (80% overall) had 1 drug present, but specimens positive for 2 to 6 discrete drugs were found. Universal UCTDA allows for unbiased assessment of drug exposure in infants. With the additional knowledge of therapeutic indications for drug use, UCTDA may allow for analysis of trends in illicit drug use and the impact of interventions to curb neonatal abstinence syndrome.","Amphetamine;Analgesics, Opioid;Appalachian Region;Buprenorphine;Cocaine;Dataset;Death;Dronabinol;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Female;Fentanyl;Health;Humans;Hydrocodone;Illicit Drugs;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Knowledge;Morphine;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Overall;Oxycodone;Parents;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Program;Report;Retrospective Studies;Screening;Separated;Substance Abuse Detection;Therapeutics;Tissues;Umbilical Cord;West Virginia",Death;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Substance Abuse,J Appl Lab Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33348147,2021,High prevalence of co-occurring substance use in individuals with opioid use disorder.,"Funding to address the current opioid epidemic has focused on treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD); however, rates of other substance use disorders (SUDs) remain high and non-opioid related overdoses account for nearly 30% of overdoses. This study assesses the prevalence of co-occurring substance use in West Virginia (WV) to inform treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, gender, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status) associated with, co-occurring substance use among patients with OUD in WV. This retrospective study utilized the West Virginia Clinical and Translation Science Institute Integrated Data Repository, comprised of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from West Virginia University Medicine. Deidentified data were extracted from inpatient psychiatric admissions and emergency department (ED) healthcare encounters between 2009 and 2018. Eligible patients were those with OUD who had a positive urine toxicology screen for opioids at the time of their initial encounter with the healthcare system. Extracted data included results of comprehensive urine toxicology testing during the study timeframe. 3,127 patients met the inclusion criteria of whom 72.8% had co-occurring substance use. Of those who were positive for opioids and at least one additional substance, benzodiazepines were the most common co-occurring substances (57.4% of patients yielded a positive urine toxicology screen for both substances), followed by cannabis (53.1%), cocaine (24.5%) and amphetamine (21.6%). Individuals who used co-occurring substances were younger than those who were positive for opioids alone (P &lt; 0.001). There was a higher prevalence of individuals who used co-occurring substances that were HCV positive in comparison to those who used opioids alone (P &lt; 0.001). There were limited gender differences noted between individuals who used co-occurring substances and those who used opioids alone. Among ED admissions who were positive for opioids, 264 were diagnosed with substance toxicity/overdose, 78.4% of whom had co-occurring substance use (benzodiazepines: 65.2%; cannabis: 44.4%; cocaine: 28.5%; amphetamine: 15.5%). Across the 10-year timespan, the greatest increase for the entire sample was in the rate of co-occurring amphetamine and opioid use (from 12.6% in 2014 to 47.8% in 2018). These data demonstrate that the current substance use epidemic extends well beyond opioids, suggesting that comprehensive SUD prevention and treatment strategies are needed, especially for those substances which do not yet have any evidence-based and/or medication treatments available.","Address;Amphetamine;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Cannabis;Cocaine;Demography;Drug Overdose;Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Epidemics;Gender;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Hepatitis C virus;Humans;Inpatients;Institutes;Medicine;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prevalence;Retrospective Studies;Science;Sex Characteristics;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Translations;Universities;Urine;West Virginia",Drug Overdose;Hepatitis C;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Addict Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

The purpose of this study was to identify gaps in organizational capacity and readiness to provide medications for AUD in outpatient public mental health clinics. We selected a purposive sample of eight publicly funded outpatient mental health clinics operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health; clinics were chosen to maximize heterogeneity. Guided by theories of organizational capacity and readiness and research on the adoption of pharmacotherapy for AUD in primary and specialty care treatment settings, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with administrators, providers and staff, and a qualitative analysis of the results. Respondents described significant organizational capacity and behavioral readiness constraints to providing medication treatment for AUD. Both groups articulated a perception that mental health clinics were not designed to provide co-occurring AUD treatment because of large caseloads, staffing configurations, and time constraints that did not support the delivery of appropriate treatment, and a lack of protocols and workflow procedures. We documented organizational capacity and readiness constraints which impede the delivery of medication treatment for AUD in a large mental helth system. While some constraints have straightforward solutions, others require structural changes to the way care is delivered, and state-level funding and policy changes.",Administrators;Adoption;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Capacity Building;Drug Therapy;Focus Groups;Humans;Interview;Los Angeles;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Outpatients;Perception;Policy;Procedures;Research;Respondents;Solutions;Therapeutics;Time;Workflow;Workforce,Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Mental Disorders,Adm Policy Ment Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

We performed a prospective study in pregnant women using opioids and healthy pregnant women without prenatal opioid use. We evaluated brain maturation, structure, and morphometry on second or third trimester fetal MRI and assessed group differences. 28 pregnant women were enrolled, 12 with opioid exposure (average gestational age 33.67, range 28-39 w), 9 of whom also smoked, and 16 without opioid exposure (average gestational age 32.53, range 27-38 w). There was a significant difference in the anteroposterior diameter of the fetal cerebellar vermis in the opioid exposed fetuses compared to non-opioid exposed fetuses (p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in brain biparietal diameter, fronto-occipital diameter, transverse cerebellar diameter and anteroposterior dimension of the pons in opioid exposed fetuses compared to non-opioid exposed fetuses. There were no abnormalities in brain maturation and no major brain structural abnormalities in the opioid exposed fetuses. Smaller fetal anteroposterior cerebellar vermian dimension was associated with in utero opioid exposure. There were no abnormalities in brain maturation or major structural abnormalities in fetuses exposed to opioids.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Brain;Cerebellar Vermis;Cerebellum;Female;Fetal Development;Fetus;Gestational Age;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pilot Projects;Pons;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Pregnant Women;Prospective Studies;Smoking",Opioid Use Disorder,J Neuroradiol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,

33429107,2021,A Role for Protease Activated Receptor Type 3 (PAR3) in Nociception Demonstrated Through Development of a Novel Peptide Agonist.,"The protease activated receptor (PAR) family is a group of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain. PARs are expressed in a variety of cell types with crucial roles in homeostasis, immune responses, inflammation, and pain. PAR3 is the least researched of the four PARs, with little known about its expression and function. We sought to better understand its potential function in the peripheral sensory nervous system. Mouse single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrates that PAR3 is widely expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Co-expression of PAR3 mRNA with other PARs was identified in various DRG neuron subpopulations, consistent with its proposed role as a coreceptor of other PARs. We developed a lipid tethered PAR3 agonist, C660, that selectively activates PAR3 by eliciting a Ca2+ response in DRG and trigeminal neurons. In vivo, C660 induces mechanical hypersensitivity and facial grimacing in WT but not PAR3-/- mice. We characterized other nociceptive phenotypes in PAR3-/- mice and found a loss of hyperalgesic priming in response to IL-6, carrageenan, and a PAR2 agonist, suggesting that PAR3 contributes to long-lasting nociceptor plasticity in some contexts. To examine the potential role of PAR3 in regulating the activity of other PARs in sensory neurons, we administered PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 agonists and assessed mechanical and affective pain behaviors in WT and PAR3-/- mice. We observed that the nociceptive effects of PAR1 agonists were potentiated in the absence of PAR3. Our findings suggest a complex role of PAR3 in the physiology and plasticity of nociceptors. PERSPECTIVE: We evaluated the role of PAR3, a G-protein coupled receptor, in nociception by developing a selective peptide agonist. Our findings suggest that PAR3 contributes to nociception in various contexts and plays a role in modulating the activity of other PARs.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing;Animals;Behavior;Carrageenan;Cell Cycle Proteins;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Family;Ganglia, Spinal;Homeostasis;Hypersensitivity;Immunity;Inflammation;Interleukin-6;Lipids;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Inbred ICR;Mice, Knockout;Nervous System;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Peptides;Phenotype;Physiology;Play;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Proteinase-Activated;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sequence Determinations, RNA",Ganglion Cysts;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Pain,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33449506,2021,A peptide encoded within a 5' untranslated region promotes pain sensitization in mice.,"Translational regulation permeates neuronal function. Nociceptors are sensory neurons responsible for the detection of harmful stimuli. Changes in their activity, termed plasticity, are intimately linked to the persistence of pain. Although inhibitors of protein synthesis robustly attenuate pain-associated behavior, the underlying targets that support plasticity are largely unknown. Here, we examine the contribution of protein synthesis in regions of RNA annotated as noncoding. Based on analyses of previously reported ribosome profiling data, we provide evidence for widespread translation in noncoding transcripts and regulatory regions of mRNAs. We identify an increase in ribosome occupancy in the 5' untranslated regions of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP/Calca). We validate the existence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) using a series of reporter assays. Fusion of the uORF to a luciferase reporter revealed active translation in dorsal root ganglion neurons after nucleofection. Injection of the peptide corresponding to the calcitonin gene-related peptide-encoded uORF resulted in pain-associated behavioral responses in vivo and nociceptor sensitization in vitro. An inhibitor of heterotrimeric G protein signaling blocks both effects. Collectively, the data suggest pervasive translation in regions of the transcriptome annotated as noncoding in dorsal root ganglion neurons and identify a specific uORF-encoded peptide that promotes pain sensitization through GPCR signaling.","5' Untranslated Regions;Animals;Behavior;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Ganglia, Spinal;Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins;In Vitro;Injections;Luciferases;Mice;Neurons;Nociceptors;Open Reading Frames;Pain;Peptides;Proteins;RNA;RNA, Messenger;Regulation;Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid;Ribosomes;Sensory Receptor Cells;Transcriptome;Translations",Ganglion Cysts;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33450136,2022,Development of a Medicare Claims-Based Model to Predict Persistent High-Dose Opioid Use After Total Knee Replacement.,"To develop a claims-based model to predict persistent high-dose opioid use among patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). Using Medicare claims (2010-2014), we identified patients ages ≥65 years who underwent TKR with no history of high-dose opioid use (mean &gt;25 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]/day) in the year prior to TKR. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct opioid use patterns. The primary outcome was persistent high-dose opioid use in the year after TKR. We split the data into training (2010-2013) and test (2014) sets and used logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization, utilizing a total of 83 preoperative patient characteristics as candidate predictors. A reduced model with 10 prespecified variables, which included demographic characteristics, opioid use, and medication history was also considered. The final study cohort included 142,089 patients who underwent TKR. The group-based trajectory model identified 4 distinct trajectories of opioid use (group 1: short-term, low-dose; group 2: moderate-duration, low-dose; group 3: moderate-duration, high-dose; and group 4: persistent high-dose). The model predicting persistent high-dose opioid use achieved high discrimination (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.84-0.86]) in the test set. The reduced model with 10 predictors performed equally well (AUC 0.84 [95% CI 0.84-0.85]). In this cohort of older patients, 10.6% became persistent high-dose (mean 22.4 MME/day) opioid users after TKR. Our model with 10 readily available clinical factors may help identify patients at high risk of future adverse outcomes from persistent opioid use after TKR.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Area Under Curve;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Future;History;Humans;Logistic Regression;Medicare;Morphine;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Retrospective Studies;Risk;United States","Pain, Postoperative",Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33499543,2021,Development and Implementation of the Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC) to Support Pragmatic Clinical Trials in the Military Health System.,"Within the population of military service members and veterans, chronic pain is highly prevalent, often complex, and frequently related to traumatic experiences that are more likely to occur to members of this demographic, such as individuals with traumatic brain injury or limb loss. In September 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Defense (DOD), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) was formed as a significant and innovative inter-government agency partnership to support a multicomponent research initiative focusing on nonpharmacological approaches for pain management addressing the needs of service members, their dependents, and veterans. A Pain Management Collaboratory Coordinating Center (PMC3) was also established to facilitate collective learning across 11 individually funded pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) designed to optimize the impact of the PMC as an integrated whole. Although the DOD and VA health care systems are ideal sites for the enactment of PCTs, executing these trials within the local context of DOD military treatment facilities (MTFs) can present unique challenges. The Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC) was created to support the efforts of the PMC3 in its role as a national resource for development and refinement of innovative tools, best practices, and other resources in the conduct of high impact PCTs. The MTFEC is composed of experts from each service who bring experiences in executing clinical pain management trials that can enhance the planning and execution of the PCTs. It provides expertise and leadership in the execution of research studies at within MTFs and within the DOD health care system, with guidance from PMC3 Directors and in collaboration with NIH, DOD, and VA program and scientific officers. Considering the importance of enacting large-scale, pragmatic studies to implement effective strategies in clinical practice for chronic pain management, the MTFEC has begun to actualize its purpose by identifying potential barriers and challenges to study implementation and exploring how the PMC can support and aid in the execution of PCTs by applying similar approaches to stakeholder and subject matter engagement for their research.","Best Practices;Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Chronic Pain;Demography;Extremities;Government Agencies;Health Care Systems;Humans;Leadership;Learning;Military Health Services;Military Personnel;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Needs;Pain Management;Population;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Program;Research;Resources;Role;Scales;Therapeutics;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans","Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Chronic Pain;Pain",Mil Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33506076,2021,Effects of the FDA Codeine Safety Investigation on Racial and Geographic Disparities in Opioid Prescribing after Pediatric Tonsillectomy and/or Adenoidectomy.,"Objective. Our objective was to examine the impact of the U.S. FDA's 2013 black box warning against codeine on codeine and other opioid prescription filling after pediatric tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (T/A) overall and by child race and provider urbanity/rurality. Methods. Patients ≤ 18 who underwent T/A in 8/2011 to 8/2016 were identified in Ohio Medicaid claims. Interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the FDA warning on codeine or other opioid prescription filling post-T/A. Results. In August 2011, codeine prescription filling was lower among black than white children (P &lt; .001) and among children treated at institutions in metropolitan counties than less populous counties (P &lt; .001). The FDA warning was associated with a 24.0% drop in codeine prescription filling (P &lt; .001) and 5.5% increase in alternative opioid prescription filling (P = .046). At conclusion, there remained geographic but no longer racial disparities in codeine prescribing. Conclusion. Codeine prescribing after pediatric T/A decreased after the FDA's black box warning.

Opioids are overprescribed after surgery, which negatively impacts patient outcomes. The assumption that larger prescriptions increase patient satisfaction has been suggested as an important driver of excessive prescribing. This prospective cohort study evaluated opioid-naive adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, and minor hernia repair between January 1 and May 31, 2018. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction, collected via a 30-day postoperative survey. Satisfaction was measured on a scale of 0 to 10 and dichotomized into ""highly satisfied"" (9-10) and ""not highly satisfied"" (0-8). The explanatory variable of interest was size of opioid prescription at discharge from surgery, converted into milligrams of oral morphine equivalents (OME). Hierarchical logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between prescription size and satisfaction while adjusting for clinical covariates. One thousand five hundred twenty patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 53 years and 43% of patients were female. One thousand two hundred seventy-nine (84.1%) patients were highly satisfied and 241 (15.9%) were not highly satisfied. After multivariable adjustment, there was no significant association between opioid prescription size and satisfaction (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.00). The predicted probability of being highly satisfied ranged from 83% for the smallest prescription (25 mg OME) to 85% for the largest prescription (750 mg OME). In a large cohort of patients undergoing common surgical procedures, there was no association between opioid prescription size at discharge after surgery and patient satisfaction. This implies that surgeons can provide significantly smaller opioid prescriptions after surgery without negatively affecting patient satisfaction.","Adjustment;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Appendectomy;Association;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Cohort Studies;Female;General Surgery;Herniorrhaphy;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Minors;Morphine;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Probability;Prospective Studies;Retrospective Studies;Satisfaction;Scales;Surgeons;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Surveys","Hernia;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

The objectives of this study were to conduct time series modeling to describe the PDMP policy reform impact on prescribing rates for human and veterinary providers. We obtained data from the WV PDMP for 2008 through 2020 for the number of opioid prescriptions filled and providers. We estimated prescribing rates for human and veterinary providers separately based upon the top five opioids prescribed by veterinarians. We estimated temporal effects using a Bayesian log-normal time series model for humans and veterinarians separately. Throughout the study period prescribing rates increased significantly for veterinarians, and decreased for human providers, particularly during 2018 after implementation of the Opioid Reduction Act. Findings provide novel insight into the differential impact of policy on specialty practices and highlight decreasing human opioid prescribing observed elsewhere.","Analgesics, Opioid;Bayes Theorem;Drug Misuse;Humans;Opioids;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Time;Veterinarians;Veterinary Medicine;West Virginia",,J Public Health Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33605582,2022,Association of Opioid Type With Opioid Consumption After Surgery.,"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients prescribed hydrocodone consume a similar number of tablets as those prescribed oxycodone after surgery. In October 2017, the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network released opioid prescribing guidelines for surgeries. For each procedure, these guidelines recommended prescribing 50% more tablets of hydrocodone than tablets of oxycodone to adjust for potency differences. These guidelines were simplified in January 2019 to recommend the same number of 5 mg hydrocodone tablets as 5 mg oxycodone tablets for each procedure. Retrospective, observational analysis of opioid-naïve adults who underwent surgical procedures across 64 hospitals in Michigan and were prescribed 5 mg tablets of hydrocodone or oxycodone between January 1, 2018 and May 31, 2019. The primary outcome was number of tablets consumed. We defined a meaningful difference in consumption as 5 pills a priori. Secondary outcomes included self-reported pain, satisfaction, and opioid refills. A total of 6842 patients were included. Adjusting for covariates, patients prescribed hydrocodone consumed 7 tablets (95% confidence interval 6.79-7.18) while patients prescribed oxycodone consumed 6 tablets (95% confidence interval 5.58-6.40.) Comparing patients prescribed oxycodone with those prescribed hydrocodone, there were no differences in satisfaction, pain, or refills. Although patients prescribed hydrocodone consumed more tablets than patients prescribed oxycodone, this difference was not clinically significant and did not result in differences in satisfaction, pain, or refills. Perioperative opioid prescribing guidelines may recommend the same number of 5 mg oxycodone and hydrocodone tablets without sacrificing patient-reported outcomes.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Confidence Intervals;Consumption;General Surgery;Guideline;Hospitals;Humans;Hydrocodone;Michigan;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Procedures;Retrospective Studies;Satisfaction;Self;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Tablets","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33622085,2021,Aberrant Brain Signal Variability and COMT Genotype in Chronic TMD Patients.,"The analysis of brain signal variability is a promising approach to understand pathological brain function related to chronic pain. This study investigates whether blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal variability (BOLDSV) in specific frequency bands is altered in temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and correlated to its clinical features. Twelve patients with chronic myofascial TMD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The BOLDSV was measured as the standard deviation of the BOLD time series at each voxel and compared between groups. We also examined the potential relationship between the BOLDSV and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism. We assessed sensory-discriminative pain in the craniofacial region, pain sensitivity to sustained masseteric pain challenge, and TMD pain frequency for clinical correlation. Patients displayed reduced BOLDSV in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as compared with HC in all frequency bands. In the slow-3 band, patients also showed reduced BOLDSV in the medial dorsal thalamus, primary motor cortex (M1), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and heightened BOLDSV in the temporal pole. Notably, we found a significant correlation between lower BOLDSV (slow-3) in the orofacial M1/S1 regions and higher clinical pain (intensity/area) and higher sensitivity of the masseter muscle pain. Moreover, lower BOLDSV (slow-3) in the dlPFC and ventrolateral PFC was associated with a higher TMD pain frequency. Participants who had the COMT 158Met substitution exhibited lower BOLDSV in the dlPFC and higher BOLDSV in the temporal pole as compared with participants without the COMT 158Met substitution. An increasing number of Met alleles was associated with lower dlPFC and greater temporal pole BOLDSV in both HC and TMD groups. Together, we demonstrated that chronic TMD patients exhibit aberrant BOLDSV in the top-down pain modulatory and sensorimotor circuits associated with their pain frequency and severity. COMT Val158Met polymorphism might affect clinical symptoms in association with regional brain signal variability, specifically involved in cognitive and emotional regulation of pain.",Affect;Alleles;Association;Blood;Brain;Catechol O-Methyltransferase;Chronic Pain;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Emotional Regulation;Exhibition;Facial Pain;Genetics;Genotype;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Masseter Muscle;Neuroimaging;Oxygen;Pain;Patients;Primary Motor Cortex;Primary Somatosensory Cortex;Sensitivity;Standards;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Thalamus;Time;Vals;fMRI,Chronic Pain;Facial Pain;Myalgia;Pain;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,J Dent Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33624534,2021,Increased health care costs associated with new persistent opioid use after major surgery in opioid-naive patients.,"BACKGROUND: Opioid use after surgery is associated with increased health care utilization and costs. Although some studies show that surgical patients may later become persistent opioid users, data on the association between new persistent opioid use after surgery and health care utilization and costs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare health care utilization and costs after major inpatient or METHODS: The IBM MarketScan Research databases were used to identify opioid-naive patients with major inpatient or outpatient surgeries and at least 1 year of continuous enrollment before and after this index surgery. Cohorts were stratified by new persistent opioid utilization status, setting of surgery (inpatient, outpatient), and payer (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid). Patients were considered new persistent opioid users if they had at least 1 opioid claim 4-90 days after index surgery and at least 1 opioid claim 91-180 days after index surgery. Patients with opioid prescription claims between 1 year and 15 days before their index event were excluded. Health care utilization and costs (excluding index surgery) were measured in the 1-year period after surgery. Predicted costs and cost ratios were estimated using multivariable log-linked gamma-family generalized linear models. RESULTS: In the inpatient cohorts, 827,583 commercial, 186,154 Medicare, and 104,734 Medicaid patients were included in the study, and the incidence of new persistent opioid use in these cohorts was 4.1%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively. In the outpatient cohorts, 1,542,565 commercial, 390,876 Medicare, and 94,878 Medicaid patients were selected, with 2.0%, 1.5%, and 6.4% new persistent opioid use, respectively. Across all 3 payers in both surgical settings, patients with new persistent opioid use had a higher comorbidity burden and more use of concomitant medications in the baseline period. In the 1-year period after index surgery, patients with new persistent opioid use had more inpatient admissions, emergency department visits, and ambulance/paramedic service use than patients without persistent use, regardless of payer and setting. Patients with new persistent opioid use had approximately 5 times more opioid prescriptions and also had more nonopioid pharmacy claims than those without persistent use across all cohorts. After covariate adjustment, predicted 1-year total health care costs were significantly higher for patients with new persistent opioid use compared with those without persistent use for all comparisons (commercial inpatient: $29,499 vs. $11,798; Medicare inpatient: $34,455 vs. $21,313; Medicaid inpatient: $14,622 vs. $6,678; commercial outpatient: $18,751 vs. $7,517; Medicare outpatient ($26,411 vs. $13,577; Medicaid outpatient: $12,381 vs. $6,784; all P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New persistent opioid use after major surgery in opioid-naive patients is associated with increased health care utilization and costs in the year after surgery across all surgical settings and payers.

Data on 1,117,086 individuals age 12 and older were from the 1999-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We compared relative prevalences across 6 racial/ethnic groups for prescription opioid misuse analyses and 4 racial/ethnic groups for heroin analyses. Unadjusted and gender- and age-adjusted prevalences are reported for 5 time periods (1999-2002, 2003-2006, 2007-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2018). Survey-weighted Poisson regression models with robust variance were used to estimate risk ratios by race/ethnicity and to test for time trends. Prescription opioid misuse was significantly higher among non-Hispanic White individuals than among Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals across all time periods, yet was highest among Native American individuals in every time period. The relative difference between White and both Hispanic and Asian individuals significantly widened over time, whereas the gap between Black and White individuals significantly decreased. Early in the study period, heroin use was highest among Black and Hispanic individuals. Heroin use among White individuals first surpassed all other groups in 2007-2010 and continued to steadily increase, more than doubling from 1999-2002 to 2015-2018. While heroin use has risen among all racial/ethnic groups, the demographics of heroin use have changed significantly in the past two decades such that prevalence is now highest among White individuals. Opioid prevention and treatment initiatives should both be informed by the changing demographics of heroin use and seek to reduce opioid-related harms and expand treatment access equitably for all racial/ethnic groups.","Adult;African Americans;American Natives;Analgesics, Opioid;Asians;Blacks;Child;Demography;Ethnic Groups;Female;Gender;Health;Heroin;Hispanics;Humans;Latinos;Male;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prevalence;Racial Stocks;Relatives;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Whites",Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Drug Alcohol Depend,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
33765516,2021,A qualitative assessment of discharge against medical advice among patients hospitalized for injection-related bacterial infections in West Virginia.,"The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) and other systemic bacterial infections is increasing, and people who inject drugs (PWID) have higher rates of discharge against medical advice (AMA) for these infections than patients whose infections are not injection-related. In this study, we characterize factors that contribute to AMA hospital discharge among PWID. We conducted qualitative interviews with twenty PWID hospitalized with serious injection-related bacterial infections in West Virginia. Participants completed a brief survey and in-depth qualitative interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a codebook developed based on deductive and inductive thematic analysis. We also conducted medical records abstraction and used descriptive statistics to summarize medical and survey data. Average age was 34 years, 55% were female, 95% identified as white, and 75% had a primary diagnosis of IE. Drugs injected prior to hospitalization were methamphetamine (60%), prescription opioids (38%), and/or heroin/fentanyl (25%). Participants cited multiple contributors to AMA discharge including negative interactions with hospital staff that they perceived as stigmatizing, including being searched or monitored for illicit drug use; inadequate management of pain and withdrawal; boredom and confinement during lengthy hospitalizations; and isolation from family and other social supports. We identified multiple factors contributing to AMA discharge that are amenable to intervention. Given the significant morbidity, mortality, and financial costs associated with hospitalizing PWID for serious injection-related bacterial infections, hospitals should be highly motivated to develop and test interventions designed to improve outcomes among these patients.","Adult;Bacterial Infections;Boredom;Cost;Diagnosis;Endocarditis;Family;Female;Fentanyl;Heroin;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Incidence;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Injections;Interview;Medical Records;Methamphetamine;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioids;Pain;Patient Discharge;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Social Support;Statistics;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Surveys;West Virginia;Whites","Bacterial Infections;Endocarditis;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Pain;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33801173,2021,Sublingual Buprenorphine/Naloxone and Multi-Modal Management for High-Risk Chronic Pain Patients.,"Patients with chronic pain managed with opioid medications are at high risk for opioid overuse or misuse. West Virginia University (WVU) established a High-Risk Pain Clinic to use sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (bup/nal) plus a multimodal approach to help chronic pain patients with history of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) or aberrant drug-related behavior. The objective of this study was to report overall retention rates and indicators of efficacy in pain control from approximately six years of High-Risk Pain Clinic data. A retrospective chart review was conducted for a total of 78 patients who enrolled in the High-Risk Pain Clinic between 2014 and 2020. Data gathered include psychiatric diagnoses, prescribed medications, pain score, buprenorphine/naloxone dosing, time in clinic, and reason for dismissal. A linear mixed effects model was used to assess the pain score from the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and daily bup/nal dose across time. The overall retention of the High-Risk Pain Clinic was 41%. The mean pain score demonstrated a significant downward trend across treatment time (p &lt; 0.001), while the opposite trend was seen with buprenorphine dose (p &lt; 0.001). With the benefit of six years of observation, this study supports buprenorphine/naloxone as a safe and efficacious component of comprehensive chronic pain treatment in patients with SUD or high-risk of opioid overuse or misuse.","Behavior;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Chart;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis;History;Indicators;Naloxone;Observation;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Clinics;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Report;Review;Risk;Scales;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Universities;Veterans;West Virginia",Chronic Pain;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,J Clin Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33820654,2021,Predicting postoperative opioid use with machine learning and insurance claims in opioid-naïve patients.,"The clinical impact of postoperative opioid use requires accurate prediction strategies to identify at-risk patients. We utilize preoperative claims data to predict postoperative opioid refill and new persistent use in opioid-naïve patients. A retrospective study was conducted on 112,898 opioid-naïve adult postoperative patients from Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart database. Potential predictors included sociodemographic data, comorbidities, and prescriptions within one year prior to surgery. Compared to linear models, non-linear models led to modest improvements in predicting refills - area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) 0.68 vs. 0.67 (p &lt; 0.05) - and performed identically in predicting new persistent use - AUROC = 0.66. Undergoing major surgery, opioid prescriptions within 30 days prior to surgery, and abdominal pain were useful in predicting refills; back/joint/head pain were the most important features in predicting new persistent use. Preoperative patient attributes from insurance claims could potentially be useful in guiding prescription practices for opioid-naïve patients.","Abdominal Pain;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Area Under Curve;Arthralgia;Back;Back Pain;Comorbidity;Data Mart;Database;Databases, Pharmaceutical;Female;Forecasting;General Surgery;Headache;Humans;Insurance;Insurance Claim Review;Joints;Linear Models;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Nonlinear;News;Opioids;Patients;Postoperative Period;Preoperative Period;Prescription Drug Overuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;ROC Curve;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Young Adult",Abdominal Pain;Arthralgia;Back Pain;Headache,Am J Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33843594,2021,De-Implementing Opioid Use and Implementing Optimal Pain Management Following Dental Extractions (DIODE): Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Trial.,"Overdose deaths from prescription opioid analgesics are a continuing crisis in the United States. Opioid analgesics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs by dentists. An estimated 5 million people undergo third-molar extractions in the United States each year, resulting in postoperative pain. Studies show that, in most cases, the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is an effective alternative to commonly prescribed opioid analgesics for the management of postextraction pain. Nevertheless, many dentists routinely prescribe opioids after dental extractions. We describe the rationale, design, and methods for a randomized trial of interventions designed to de-implement opioid prescribing by dentists while implementing effective nonopioid analgesics following dental extractions. Using a prospective, 3-arm, cluster randomized trial design with dentists as the unit randomized and patient-level prescribing data as the primary outcome, we will compare different strategies to reduce the reliance on opioids and increase the use of alternative pain management approaches utilizing information support tools aimed at both providers and their patients. The study will test the efficacy of 2 interventions to decrease opioid prescribing following dental extractions: clinical decision support with (CDS-E) and without patient education (CDS). Providers will be randomized to CDS, CDS-E, or standard practice. Patient-level outcomes will be determined via review of comprehensive electronic health records. We will compare study arms on differential change in prescribing patterns from pre- to postimplementation of the intervention. The primary outcome of interest is a binary indicator of whether or not the patient received an opioid prescription on the day of the extraction encounter. We will also examine recommendations or prescriptions for nonopioid analgesics, patients' perceptions of shared decision making, and patients' pain experiences following the extraction. The HealthPartners Institutional Review Board approved the study. All study materials including the CDS and patient education materials have been developed and pilot tested, and the protocol has been approved by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. The intervention was implemented in February 2020, with 51 dentists who were randomized to 1 of the 3 arms. If the intervention strategies are shown to be effective, they could be implemented more broadly in dental settings with high levels of opioid prescribing.

Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation has been used extensively for chronic pain, but only uncontrolled series have been published for acute postoperative pain. The current multicenter study was undertaken to (1) determine the feasibility and optimize the protocol for a subsequent clinical trial and (2) estimate the treatment effect of percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Preoperatively, an electrical lead was percutaneously implanted to target the sciatic nerve for major foot/ankle surgery (e.g., hallux valgus correction), the femoral nerve for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, or the brachial plexus for rotator cuff repair, followed by a single injection of long-acting local anesthetic along the same nerve/plexus. Postoperatively, participants were randomized to 14 days of either electrical stimulation (n = 32) or sham stimulation (n = 34) using an external pulse generator in a double-masked fashion. The dual primary treatment effect outcome measures were (1) cumulative opioid consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) and (2) mean values of the ""average"" daily pain scores measured on the 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale within the first 7 postoperative days. During the first 7 postoperative days, opioid consumption in participants given active stimulation was a median (interquartile range) of 5 mg (0 to 30) versus 48 mg (25 to 90) in patients given sham treatment (ratio of geometric means, 0.20 [97.5% CI, 0.07 to 0.57]; P &lt; 0.001).

33890894,2021,A Qualitative Study of Patient Protection against Postoperative Opioid Addiction: A Thematic Analysis of Self-Agency.,"Opioids are commonly used following outpatient surgery. However, we understand little about patients' perspectives and how patients decide on postoperative opioid use. This study seeks to investigate aspects of patients' thought processes that most impact their decisions. The authors conducted semistructured interviews with 30 adults undergoing minor elective hand surgery at one tertiary hospital. Narratives were content-coded to arrive at the authors' thematic analysis. The authors incorporated Bandura's concept of self-agency to interpret the data and develop a conceptual framework that best explained the implicit theory within participants' responses. The authors found six themes under two domains of self-agency. Participants actively sought out protective mechanisms supporting their decision on opioid use, but sometimes did so unconsciously. They would avoid opioids postoperatively because they were ""tough"" and wanted to evade the risk of addiction as ""good citizens."" They conveyed a nuanced safety against addiction because they were ""not the kind"" to become addicted and because they trusted the surgeons' prescribing. However, participants felt discouraged by the stigma associated with opioids. Both intentionally and unintentionally, participants integrated a strong sense of self in their decision-making processes. A robust understanding of how patients choose to take opioids for postoperative pain control is imperative to develop patient-centered strategies to treat the opioid epidemic. Effective opioid-reduction policies should consider patients as active agents who negotiate various internal and external influences in their decision-making processes. Surgeons must incorporate patients' individual goals and perspectives regarding postoperative opioid use to minimize opioid-related harm after surgery.","Adult;Ambulatory Surgical Procedures;Analgesics, Opioid;Comprehension;Decision Making;General Surgery;Goals;Hand;Humans;Interview;Minors;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Policy;Postoperative Complications;Qualitative Research;Risk;Safety;Self;Self Care;Surgeons;Tertiary Care Centers;Thought","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications",Plast Reconstr Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33895223,2021,Persistent Opioid Use after Ophthalmic Surgery in Opioid-Naive Patients and Associated Risk Factors.,"To determine the rate and risk factors for new persistent opioid use after ophthalmic surgery in the United States. Retrospective claims-based cohort analysis. Opioid-naive patients 13 years of age and older who underwent incisional ophthalmic surgery between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2017, and were included in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart database. New persistent opioid use was defined as filling an opioid prescription in the 90-day and the 91- to 180-day periods after the surgical procedure. The outcome variable was an initial perioperative opioid prescription fill. Rates of new persistent opioid use were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables increasing the risk of new persistent use and refill of an opioid prescription after the initial perioperative prescription in first 30 days. New persistent opioid use and refill. A total of 327 379 opioid-naive patients (mean age, 67 years [standard deviation, 16 years]; 178 067 women [54.4%]) who underwent ophthalmic surgery were examined. Among these patients, 14 841 (4.5%) had an initial perioperative opioid fill. The rate of new persistent opioid use was 3.4% (498 of 14 841 patients) compared with 0.6% (1833 of 312 538 patients) in patients who did not have an initial perioperative opioid fill. After adjusting for patient characteristics, initial perioperative opioid fill was associated independently with increased odds of new persistent use (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 6.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.57-6.91; P &lt; 0.001). Among patients who had filled an initial perioperative prescription, a prescription size of 150 morphine milligram equivalents or more was associated with an increased odds of refill (adjusted OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.58-2.22; P &lt; 0.001). Exposure to opioids in the perioperative period is associated with new persistent use in patients who were previously opioid-naive.

33934499,2022,"The acceptability and feasibility of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment for pain management among new England veterans with chronic pain: A pilot study.","Musculoskeletal disorders often lead to chronic pain in Veterans. Chronic pain puts sufferers at risk for substance misuse, and early intervention is needed for both conditions. This pilot study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management intervention (SBIRT-PM) to help engage Veterans seeking disability compensation for painful musculoskeletal disorders in multimodal pain treatment and to reduce risky substance use, when indicated. This pilot study enrolled 40 Veterans from 8 medical centers across New England in up to 4 sessions of telephone-based counseling using a motivational interviewing framework. Counseling provided education about, and facilitated engagement in, multimodal pain treatments. Study eligibility required Veterans be engaged in no more than 2 Veteran Affairs (VA) pain treatment modalities, and study participation involved a 12-week postassessment and semistructured interview about the counseling process. Majorities of enrolled Veterans screened positive for comorbid depression and problematic substance use. Regarding the offered counseling, 80% of participants engaged in at least one session, with a mean of 3 sessions completed. Ninety percent of participants completed the postassessment. Numerically, most measures improved slightly from baseline to week 12. In semistructured interviews, participants described satisfaction with learning about new pain care services, obtaining assistance connecting to services, and receiving support from their counselors. It was feasible to deliver SBIRT-PM to Veterans across New England to promote engagement in multimodal pain treatment and to track study outcomes over 12 weeks. Preliminary results suggest SBIRT-PM was well-received and has promise for the targeted outcomes.",Brief Interventions;Chronic Pain;Combined Modality Therapy;Compensation;Counseling;Counselors;Crisis Intervention;Depression;Education;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Interview;Lead;Learning;Measures;Motivational Interviewing;New England;News;Outcome Studies;Pain;Pain Management;Pilot Projects;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Risk;Satisfaction;Screening;Substance Use;Telephone;Therapeutics;Track;Veterans,Chronic Pain;Pain;Substance Use,Pain Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Such trial designs are optimal for studying the impact of implementation efforts, such as the effectiveness of integrated behavioral health clinicians in primary care settings. Formal pragmatic trials conducted in integrated primary care settings are uncommon, making it difficult for researchers to anticipate the potential pitfalls associated with balancing scientific rigor with the demands of routine clinical practice. This paper is based on our experience conducting the first phase of a large, multisite, pragmatic clinical trial evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of behavioral health consultants treating patients with chronic pain using a manualized intervention, brief cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (BCBT-CP). The paper highlights key choice points using the PRagmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2) tool.

34276440,2021,Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Lorcaserin for Cocaine Use Disorder: A Phase I Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Background and Objectives: Preclinical studies show serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) agonists reduce cocaine-seeking and cocaine intake. This study examined safety of the 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin administered with cocaine in participants with cocaine use disorder (CocUD). Secondarily, subjective response to cocaine and choice of cocaine vs. money were examined. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 25 inpatient non-treatment seeking participants with CocUD. Participants were randomized to either lorcaserin (n = 17) or placebo (n = 8). Primary outcome measures included cardiovascular measures and plasma cocaine levels. Secondary measures of subjective response to cocaine were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and cocaine vs. money progressive ratio choice sessions. Results: Thirteen randomized participants were included in the final analysis. No serious or unexpected adverse events were related to lorcaserin. There were no significant interactions between cocaine and lorcaserin on cardiovascular measures, plasma cocaine, or subjective ratings. After multiple comparisons correction, cocaine significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, and QTc. Lorcaserin significantly decreased VAS ratings of ""feel irritable,"" ""feel hungry,"" and ""I am craving."" For the cocaine vs. money choice procedure, there was a significant interaction between choice (cocaine vs. money) and lorcaserin. Participants treated with lorcaserin were more likely to choose cocaine. Discussion and Conclusions: This study showed safety of lorcaserin administered with cocaine but lack of efficacy to reduce the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Scientific Significance: This study is the first to show a disconnect between effects of 5-HT2CR agonists on craving and cocaine choice in human cocaine users.","Blood Pressure;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Craving;Heart Rate;Humans;Inpatients;Measures;Methods;Outcome Measures;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placebos;Plasma;Procedures;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C;Safety;Serotonin;Therapeutics;Visual Analog Scale",,Front Psychiatry,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Adults presenting for an appointment over a 2-week period were invited to complete a voluntary, anonymous health survey. Clients who indicated opioid use in the past year were offered a longer survey assessing probable opioid use disorder. Willingness to take medication and receive treatment also was assessed. In total, 3,090 clients completed screening. Among these, 8% had a probable prescription (Rx) opioid use disorder and 2% a probable heroin use disorder. Of the clients with probable Rx opioid use or heroin use disorder, 49% and 25% were female, respectively. Among those with probable Rx opioid use disorder, 43% were Black, 33% were Hispanic, and 12% were White, and among those with probable heroin use disorder, 24% were Black, 22% were Hispanic, and 39% were White. Seventy-eight percent of those with Rx opioid use disorder had never received any treatment, and 82% had never taken a medication for this disorder; 39% of those with heroin use disorder had never received any treatment, and 39% had never received a medication. The strongest predictor of willingness to take a medication was believing that it would help stop opioid use (buprenorphine, β=13.54, p=0.003, and naltrexone long-acting injection, β=15.83, p&lt;0.001). These findings highlight the need to identify people with opioid use disorder and to educate clients in mental health settings about medications for these disorders.","Adult;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Analgesics, Opioid;Appointments;Blacks;Buprenorphine;Clients;Community;Drug Abuse;Female;Health Surveys;Heroin;Hispanics;Humans;Injections;Los Angeles;Male;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Naltrexone;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Screening;Surveys;Therapeutics;Whites",Drug Abuse;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Psychiatr Serv,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34343394,2021,"Percutaneous Neuromodulation of the Brachial Plexus and Sciatic Nerve for the Treatment of Acute Pain Following Surgery: Secondary Outcomes From a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Pilot Study.","We recently reported that percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS or ""neuromodulation"") decreased pain and opioid consumption within the first two weeks following ambulatory surgery. However, the anatomic lead locations were combined for the analysis, and benefits for each location remain unknown. We therefore now report the effects of percutaneous PNS for brachial plexus and sciatic nerve leads separately. Before surgery, leads were implanted percutaneously to target the brachial plexus (N = 21) for rotator cuff repair or sciatic nerve (N = 40) for foot/ankle surgery, followed by a single injection of local anesthetic. Postoperatively, subjects were randomized in a double masked fashion to 14 days of electrical stimulation (N = 30) or sham/placebo (N = 31) using an external pulse generator. The primary outcome of interest was opioid consumption and pain scores evaluated jointly. Thus, stimulation was deemed effective if superior on either outcome and at least noninferior on the other. For brachial plexus leads, during the first seven postoperative days pain measured with the numeric rating scale in participants given active stimulation was a median [interquartile range ] of 0.8 [0.5, 1.6] versus 3.2 [2.7, 3.5] in patients given sham (p &lt; 0.001). For this same group, opioid consumption in participants given active stimulation was 10 mg [5, 20] versus 71 mg [35, 125] in patients given sham (p = 0.043). For sciatic nerve leads, pain scores for the active treatment group were 0.7 [0, 1.4] versus 2.8 [1.6, 4.6] in patients given sham (p &lt; 0.001). During this same period, participants given active stimulation consumed 5 mg [0, 30] of opioids versus 40 mg [20, 105] in patients given sham (p = 0.004). Treatment effects did not differ statistically between the two locations.

However, what has been overlooked is the effect the opioid crisis may be having on a three-decade suicide crisis among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities that already have too few resources to address behavioral and mental health issues. This paper describes recent epidemiological trends associated with both opioid overdose and suicide at a national level for AIANs and the rest of the United States. We used data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to report historical trends of opioid overdose and suicide for AIAN and non-AIAN populations. We found alarming and potentially correlated trends of opioid use and suicidality among AIAN populations. We highlight both current and future research that will be essential to understanding and addressing the unique intersection between opioid and suicide risk and protective factors to inform dual prevention and intervention efforts among AIAN populations with potential relevance to public health response among other at-risk populations.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Attention;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Child;Community;Comprehension;Future;Humans;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Paper;Population;Protective Factors;Public Health;Report;Research;Resources;Rest;Risk;Suicide;Syndemic;United States;Young Adult",Opiate Overdose,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34407719,2021,Differential expression and transcription factor binding associated with genotype at a pharmacogenetic variant in OPRD1.,"The functional mechanism is unknown for many genetic variants associated with substance use disorder phenotypes. Rs678849, an intronic variant in the delta-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1), has been found to predict regional brain volume, addiction risk, and the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid use disorder. The variant has also been implicated as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for several genes. The objective of this study was to identify functional differences between the two alleles of rs678849 in vitro. We hypothesized that the two alleles of rs678849 would have different effects on transcriptional activity due to differential interactions with transcription factors. 15bp regions containing the C or T alleles of rs678849 were cloned into luciferase constructs and transfected into BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells to test the effect on transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using nuclear lysates from BE(2)C cell or human postmortem medial prefrontal cortex were used to identify proteins that differentially bound the two alleles. At 24 hours post-transfection, the C allele construct had significantly lower luciferase expression than the T allele construct and empty vector control (ANOVA p &lt; .001). Proteomic analysis and supershift assays identified XRCC6 as a transcription factor specifically binding the C allele, whereas hnRNP D0 was found to specifically bind the T allele. These functional differences between the C and T alleles may help explain the psychiatric and neurological phenotype differences predicted by rs678849 genotype and the potential role of the variant as an eQTL.","Alleles;Analysis of Variance;Binding Proteins;Brain;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Cells;Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay;Genes;Genetics;Genotype;Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0;Humans;In Vitro;Ku Autoantigen;Luciferases;Luciferases, Firefly;Neuroblastoma;Opioid Use Disorder;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Variants;Phenotype;Prefrontal Cortex;Proteins;Proteomics;Quantitative Trait Loci;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Risk;Role;Substance Use Disorders;Transcription Factors;Transfection",Neuroblastoma;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34621105,2021,IntelligentPooling: Practical Thompson Sampling for mHealth.,"In mobile health (mHealth) smart devices deliver behavioral treatments repeatedly over time to a user with the goal of helping the user adopt and maintain healthy behaviors. Reinforcement learning appears ideal for learning how to optimally make these sequential treatment decisions. However, significant challenges must be overcome before reinforcement learning can be effectively deployed in a mobile healthcare setting. In this work we are concerned with the following challenges: 1) individuals who are in the same context can exhibit differential response to treatments 2) only a limited amount of data is available for learning on any one individual, and 3) non-stationary responses to treatment. To address these challenges we generalize Thompson-Sampling bandit algorithms to develop IntelligentPooling. IntelligentPooling learns personalized treatment policies thus addressing challenge one. To address the second challenge, IntelligentPooling updates each user's degree of personalization while making use of available data on other users to speed up learning. Lastly, IntelligentPooling allows responsivity to vary as a function of a user's time since beginning treatment, thus addressing challenge three.",Address;Algorithms;Behavior;Devices;Exhibition;Goals;Health Care;Learning;Mobile Health;Policy;Therapeutics;Time;Work,,Mach Learn,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34693748,2022,"Impact of complex, partially nested clustering in a three-arm individually randomized group treatment trial: A case study with the wHOPE trial.","When participants in individually randomized group treatment trials are treated by multiple clinicians or in multiple group treatment sessions throughout the trial, this induces partially nested clusters which can affect the power of a trial. We investigate this issue in the Whole Health Options and Pain Education trial, a three-arm pragmatic, individually randomized clinical trial. We evaluate whether partial clusters due to multiple visits delivered by different clinicians in the Whole Health Team arm and dynamic participant groups due to changing group leaders and/or participants across treatment sessions during treatment delivery in the Primary Care Group Education arm may impact the power of the trial. We also present a Bayesian approach to estimate the intraclass correlation coefficients. We present statistical models for each treatment arm of Whole Health Options and Pain Education trial in which power is estimated under different intraclass correlation coefficients and mapping matrices between participants and clinicians or treatment sessions. Power calculations are based on pairwise comparisons. In practice, sample size calculations depend on estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficients at the treatment sessions and clinician levels. To accommodate such complexities, we present a Bayesian framework for the estimation of intraclass correlation coefficients under different participant-to-session and participant-to-clinician mapping scenarios. We simulated continuous outcome data based on various clinical scenarios in Whole Health Options and Pain Education trial using a range of intraclass correlation coefficients and mapping matrices and used Gibbs samplers with conjugate priors to obtain posteriors of the intraclass correlation coefficients under those different scenarios. Posterior means and medians and their biases are calculated for the intraclass correlation coefficients to evaluate the operating characteristics of the Bayesian intraclass correlation coefficient estimators. Power for Whole Health Team versus Primary Care Group Education is sensitive to the intraclass correlation coefficient in the Whole Health Team arm. In these two arms, an increased number of clinicians, more evenly distributed workload of clinicians, or more homogeneous treatment group sizes leads to increased power. Our simulation study for the intraclass correlation coefficient estimation indicates that the posterior mean intraclass correlation coefficient estimator has less bias when the true intraclass correlation coefficients are large (i.e. 0.10), but when the intraclass correlation coefficient is small (i.e. 0.01), the posterior median intraclass correlation coefficient estimator is less biased. Knowledge of intraclass correlation coefficients and the structure of clustering are critical to the design of individually randomized group treatment trials with partially nested clusters. We demonstrate that the intraclass correlation coefficient of the Whole Health Team arm can affect power in the Whole Health Options and Pain Education trial. A Bayesian approach provides a flexible procedure for estimating the intraclass correlation coefficients under complex scenarios. More work is needed to educate the research community about the individually randomized group treatment design and encourage publication of intraclass correlation coefficients to help inform future trial designs.","Affect;Arm;Bayes Theorem;Bayesian Analysis;Bias;Case Study;Clinical Trial;Cluster Analysis;Community;Education;Future;Health;Hope;Humans;Knowledge;Lead;Models, Statistical;Pain;Power, Psychological;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Primary Health Care;Procedures;Publications;Research;Research Design;Sample Size;Therapeutics;Work;Workload",Pain,Clin Trials,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34702274,2021,Genetics and prescription opioid use (GaPO): study design for consenting a cohort from an existing biobank to identify clinical and genetic factors influencing prescription opioid use and abuse.,"Prescription opioids (POs) are commonly used to treat moderate to severe chronic pain in the health system setting. Although they improve quality of life for many patients, more work is needed to identify both the clinical and genetic factors that put certain individuals at high risk for developing opioid use disorder (OUD) following use of POs for pain relief. With a greater understanding of important risk factors, physicians will be better able to identify patients at highest risk for developing OUD for whom non-opioid alternative therapies and treatments should be considered. We are conducting a prospective observational study that aims to identify the clinical and genetic factors most stongly associated with OUD. The study design leverages an existing biobank that includes whole exome sequencing and array genotyping. The biobank is maintained within an integrated health system, allowing for the large-scale capture and integration of genetic and non-genetic data. Participants are enrolled into the health system biobank via informed consent and then into a second study that focuses on opioid medication use. Data capture includes validated self-report surveys measuring addiction severity, depression, anxiety, and nicotine use, as well as additional clinical, prescription, and brain imaging data extracted from electronic health records. We will harness this multimodal data capture to establish meaningful patient phenotypes in order to understand the genetic and non-genetic contributions to OUD.","Alternative Therapies;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Biological Specimen Banks;Brain Imaging;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Depression;Electronic Health Records;Genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Health;Humans;Informed Consent;Nicotine;Observational Study;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Phenotype;Physicians;Prescriptions;Prospective Studies;Quality of Life;Risk;Risk Factors;Scales;Self Report;Surveys;Therapeutics;Whole Exome Sequencing;Work",Chronic Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,BMC Med Genomics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34788865,2022,Reasons for Preoperative Opioid Use Are Associated with Persistent Use following Surgery Among Patients Undergoing Total Knee and Hip Arthroplasty.,"Most studies on preoperative opioid use only describe whether or not patients use opioids without characterizing reasons for use. Knowing why patients use opioids can help inform perioperative opioid management. The objective of this study was to explore pain specific reasons for preoperative opioid use prior to total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) and their association with persistent use. This is a prospective study of 197 patients undergoing THA (n = 99) or TKA (n = 98) enrolled in the Analgesic Outcomes Study between December 2015 and November 2018. All participants reported preoperative opioid use. Reasons for preoperative opioid use were categorized as surgical site pain only (81 [41.1%]); pain in other body areas only (22 [11.2%]); and combined pain (94 [47.7%]). Compared to patients taking opioids for surgical site pain, those with combined reasons for use had 1.24 (P = .40) and 2.28 (P = .16) greater odds of persistent use at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, adjusting for relevant covariates. This study provides novel insights into the heterogeneity of reasons for presurgical opioid use in patients undergoing a THA or TKA. One key take away is that not all preoperative opioid use is the same and many patients are taking opioids preoperatively for more than just pain at the surgical site. Combined reasons for use was associated with long-term use, suggesting nonsurgical pain, in part, drives persistent opioid use after surgery. Future directions in perioperative care should focus on pain and non-pain reasons for presurgical opioid use to create tailored postoperative opioid weaning plans.","Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthroplasty;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Association;Drive;Future;General Surgery;Hip;Hip Replacement, Total;Humans;Knee;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Perioperative Care;Prospective Studies;Retrospective Studies;THA;Weaning","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

These overlapping epidemics have complex, multifactorial etiologies, and PCTs can be used to investigate the effectiveness of integrated therapies that are currently available but underused. Yet individual pragmatic studies can be limited in their reach because of existing structural and cultural barriers to dissemination and implementation. The National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs formed an interagency research partnership, the Pain Management Collaboratory. The partnership combines pragmatic trial design with collaborative tools and relationship building within a large network to advance the science and impact of nonpharmacological approaches and integrated models of care for the management of pain and common co-occurring conditions. The Pain Management Collaboratory team supports 11 large-scale, multisite PCTs in veteran and military health systems with a focus on team science with the shared aim that the ""whole is greater than the sum of the parts.""

34895768,2022,New persistent opioid use after surgery in patients with a history of remote opioid use.,"Postoperative pain management is particularly challenging in patients using opioids preoperatively, but previous studies have not stratified patients not using opioids at the time of surgery according to history of opioid use. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that history of opioid use among patients not reporting opioid use at the time of surgery was independently associated with new persistent opioid use after surgery. Using prospective perioperative data from the Analgesic Outcomes Study, we assessed outcomes of patients 18 years of age or older who underwent elective surgery between December 2015 and January 2019 and were not using opioids at the time of surgery. Patient self-reported outcome measures were collected on the day of surgery and at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was new persistent opioid use, defined as continued opioid use 3 months after surgery. The primary explanatory variable was history of opioid use, which was categorized as no history of opioid use, history of non-continuous opioid use, or history of continuous opioid use (defined as daily or almost every day for 3 months or longer). Other covariates included demographics, validated measures (pain, mood), surgery type and approach, comorbidities, and use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and benzodiazepines. Backward stepwise logistic regression models were used to determine patient factors associated with new persistent opioid use and refill after surgery. A total of 1,249 patients not taking opioids preoperatively were included in the study cohort for new persistent opioid use. A total of 54 (4.3%) patients had continued use 3 months after surgery. New persistent opioid use after surgery was independently associated with non-continuous opioid use history (adjusted odds ratio 2.9, [95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 6.94]), continuous opioid use history (adjusted odds ratio 5.0, [95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 16.76]), and moderate to high alcohol use (adjusted odds ratio 2.5, [95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 4.93]). Similarly, opioid prescription refill at 1 month after surgery was independently associated with history of non-continuous opioid use (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, [95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.24]), history of continuous opioid use (adjusted odds ratio 2.2, [95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 4.06]), and moderate to high alcohol use (adjusted odds ratio 1.7, [95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 2.48]).

34958381,2022,Counseling Veterans with Chronic Pain During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Veterans with chronic pain could be vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. We qualitatively explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of veterans receiving brief counseling focused on pain management in an ongoing clinical trial and discuss how the pandemic affected the process of motivating veterans with chronic pain to engage in interdisciplinary multimodal pain treatment at the Department of Veteran Affairs. Segments of audio-recorded counseling sessions containing content about the pandemic were transcribed and coded to identify key concepts emerging from individual counselor-participant transactions. Themes that emerged were examined with constant comparison analysis. Three major themes emerged. 1) The pandemic caused a disruption in pain management service delivery, resulting in changes to the way veterans receive services or manage their pain symptoms. 2) The pandemic offered opportunities for resilience and personal growth as veterans with chronic pain reflected on their lives and personal goals. 3) The pandemic brought veterans' mental health issues to the forefront, and these should be addressed as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic during pain treatment counseling sessions highlighted negative and positive ways participants were affected by the pandemic. These discussions provided counselors with a unique opportunity to facilitate behavior change by focusing on characteristics of resilience to motivate individuals with chronic pain to adapt and adopt positive behaviors and outlooks to improve their pain experience and quality of life. Counselors can leverage feelings of resilience and personal growth to motivate veterans' use of adaptive coping skills and a wider array of pain management services.",Behavior;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Coping Skills;Counseling;Counselors;Feelings;Goals;Growth;Humans;Mental Health;Motivational Interviewing;Pain;Pain Management;Pandemics;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trial;Therapeutics;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35241626,2022,Association of opioid exposure before surgery with opioid consumption after surgery.,"To determine the effect of prescription opioid use in the year before surgery on opioid consumption after surgery. Recently developed postoperative opioid prescribing guidelines rely on data from opioid-naïve patients. However, opioid use in the USA is common, and the impact of prior opioid exposure on the consumption of opioids after surgery is unclear. Population-based cohort study of 26,001 adults 18 years of age and older who underwent one of nine elective general or gynecologic surgical procedures between January 1, 2017 and October 31, 2019, with prospectively collected patient-reported data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) linked to state prescription drug monitoring program at 70 MSQC-participating hospitals on 30-day patient-reported opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents (OME) (primary outcome). Compared with opioid-naïve participants, opioid-exposed participants (26% of sample) consumed more prescription opioids after surgery (adjusted OME difference 12, 95% CI 10 to 14). Greater opioid exposure was associated with higher postoperative consumption in a dose-dependent manner, with chronic users reporting the greatest consumption (additional OMEs 32, 95% CI 21 to 42). However, for eight of nine procedures, 90% of opioid-exposed participants consumed ≤150 OMEs. Among those receiving perioperative prescriptions, opioid-exposed participants had higher likelihood of refill (adjusted OR 4.7, 95% CI 4.4 to 5.1), number of refills (adjusted incidence rate ratio 4.0, 95% CI 3.7 to 4.3), and average refill amount (adjusted OME difference 333, 95% CI 292 to 374)). Preoperative opioid use is associated with small increases in patient-reported opioid consumption after surgery for most patients, though greater differences exist for patients with chronic use. For most patients with preoperative opioid exposure, existing guidelines may meet their postoperative needs. However, guidelines may need tailoring for patients with chronic use, and providers should anticipate a higher likelihood of postoperative refills for all opioid-exposed patients.","Acute Pain;Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cohort Studies;Consumption;Female;General Surgery;Guideline;Gynecologic Surgical Procedures;Hospitals;Humans;Incidence Rate;Michigan;Morphine;Needs;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Procedures;Retrospective Studies","Acute Pain;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative",Reg Anesth Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study aimed to identify the incidence and predictors of new persistent opioid use after benign hysterectomy among opioid-naïve women from a set of demographic, operative, and opioid prescription characteristics of patients. In this retrospective cohort study, we identified women undergoing benign hysterectomy from 2011 to 2016 using a validated national insurance claims database (IBM MarketScan Commercial Database). After excluding women with prevalent opioid use (from 365 to 31 days preoperatively), we identified patients who received a perioperative opioid prescription (30 days before to 14 days after hysterectomy) and evaluated them for new persistent opioid use, defined as at least 1 prescription from 15 to 90 days and at least 1 prescription from 91 to 365 days postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine demographic, clinical, operative, and opioid prescription-related factors associated with new persistent use. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, and Clinical Classification Software codes were used to identify hysterectomies, preoperative pain and psychiatric diagnoses, surgical indications, and surgical complications included as covariates. We identified 114,260 women who underwent benign hysterectomy and were not prevalent opioid users, of which 93,906 (82.2%) received at least 1 perioperative opioid prescription. Of 93,906 women, 4334 (4.6%) developed new persistent opioid use. Logistic regression demonstrated that new persistent use odds is significantly increased by younger age (18-34 years; adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-2.30), southern geographic location (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-2.27), preoperative psychiatric and pain disorders (anxiety: adjusted odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.33]; arthritis: adjusted odds ratio, 1.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.40]), &gt;1 perioperative prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.88), mood disorder medication use (adjusted odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-1.64), tobacco smoking (adjusted odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-1.89), and surgical complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-2.00). Although statistically nonsignificant, total morphine milligram equivalent of ≥300 in the first perioperative prescription increased persistent use likelihood by 9% (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17). Dispensing of a first perioperative prescription before the surgery, as opposed to after, increased new persistent use odds by 61% (95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.72). Each additional perioperative day covered by a prescription increased the likelihood of persistent use by 2% (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.03). In contrast, minimally invasive hysterectomy (laparoscopic: adjusted odds ratio, 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.88]; vaginal: adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.93]) and a more recent surgery year (2016 vs reference 2011: adjusted odds ratio 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.65) significantly decreased its likelihood. New persistent opioid use after hysterectomy was associated with several patient, operative, and opioid prescription-related factors. Considering these factors may be beneficial in counseling patients and shared decision-making about perioperative prescription to decrease the risk of persistent opioid use.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Arthritis;Classification;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Counseling;Database;Decision Making, Shared;Demography;Diagnosis;Female;General Surgery;Geographic Locations;Humans;Hysterectomy;Incidence;Insurance;International Classification of Diseases;Logistic Regression;Mood Disorders;Morbidity;Morphine;Mortality;Narcotics;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Disorder;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Software;Tobacco Smoking;United States;Women;Young Adult","Arthritis;Mood Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain Disorder;Pain, Postoperative",Am J Obstet Gynecol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

The proportions of cause-specific deaths among those who were discharged from IE-related hospitalizations were compared by OUD diagnosis. The top three underlying causes of death discharged from IE hospitalization were accidental drug poisoning, mental and behavioral disorders due to polysubstance use, and cardiovascular diseases. Of the total deaths occurring among patients discharged after IE-related hospitalization, the proportion has increased seven times from 2016 to 2019 among the OUD deaths while it doubled among the non-OUD deaths. Of the total deaths occurring among patients discharged after IE-related hospitalization, the increase is higher in those with OUD diagnosis. OUD is becoming a significantly negative impactor on the survival outcome among IE patients.

35347759,2023,Understanding opioid use within a Southwestern American Indian Reservation Community: A qualitative study.,"Morbidity and mortality due to nonprescription use of opioids has been well documented following the significant increase in the availability of prescription opioids in the early 2000s. The aim of this paper is to explore community beliefs about correlates of opioid risk, protective factors, and behavioral functions of opioid misuse among American Indian youth and young adults living on or near a reservation. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with N = 18 youth and young adults who were enrolled in a parent research trial focused on American Indian youth suicide prevention. Participants were eligible if they endorsed the use of opioids themselves or by close friends or family members at any point during their trial participation. Major themes discussed include: (1) description of opioid use and those who use opioids; (2) acquisition; (3) initiation; (4) motivation to continue using; (5) consequences; and (6) possibilities for intervention. Family played an important role in the initiation of use, but was also highlighted as an important factor in treatment and recovery. A need for upstream prevention methods, including increased employment and after-school activities, was described. The insights gained through this work could help to inform treatment and prevention programs in the community. This work is timely due to the pressing urgency of the opioid epidemic nationally, and community capacity to address opioid use locally.","Address;Adolescent;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Analgesics, Opioid;Beliefs;Community;Comprehension;Employment;Family;Family Members;Friends;Humans;Indians, North American;Interview;Methods;Morbidity;Mortality;Motivation;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Paper;Parents;Prescriptions;Program;Protective Factors;Research;Risk;Role;Schools;Suicide;Therapeutics;United States;Work;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Rural Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35359894,2022,Global Brain Functional Network Connectivity in Infants With Prenatal Opioid Exposure.,"Infants with prenatal opioid and substance exposure are at higher risk of poor neurobehavioral outcomes in later childhood. Early brain imaging in infancy has the potential to identify early brain developmental alterations that may help predict behavioral outcomes in these children. In this study, using resting-state functional MRI in early infancy, we aim to identify differences in global brain network connectivity in infants with prenatal opioid and substance exposure compared to healthy control infants. In this prospective study, we recruited 23 infants with prenatal opioid exposure and 29 healthy opioid naïve infants. All subjects underwent brain resting-state functional MRI before 3 months postmenstrual age. Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) regression was performed to identify brain networks within which functional connectivity was associated with opioid exposure after adjusting for sex and gestational age. Associations of these significant networks with maternal comorbidities were also evaluated. Additionally, graph network metrics were assessed in these CAP networks. There were four CAP network components that were significantly different between the opioid exposed and healthy control infants. Two of these four networks were associated with maternal psychological factors. Intra-network graph metrics, namely average flow coefficient, clustering coefficient and transitivity were also significantly different in opioid exposed infants compared to healthy controls. Prenatal opioid exposure is associated with alterations in global brain functional networks compared to non-opioid exposed infants, with intra-network alterations in graph network modeling. These network alterations were also associated with maternal comorbidity, especially mental health. Large-scale longitudinal studies can help in understanding the clinical implications of these early brain functional network alterations in infants with prenatal opioid exposure.",Association;Benchmarks;Brain;Brain Imaging;Child;Cluster Analysis;Comorbidity;Comprehension;Gestational Age;Infant;Longitudinal Studies;Mental Health;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Prospective Studies;Psychological Factors;Risk;Scales;Sex;Syndrome;fMRI,Opioid Use Disorder;Syndrome,Front Pediatr,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35392856,2022,Pain management after third molar extractions in adolescents: a qualitative study.,"Understanding how adolescent patients make decisions about pain management after complex dental procedures could help reduce the use of opioid medications and the potential for future opioid misuse in this population. This qualitative study explores how adolescents manage pain, including how decision making with parents and providers affect their experience with opioid and non-opioid analgesics after third molar dental extractions. We used a qualitative approach for the analysis of 30 telephone-based semi-structured interviews completed by 15 dyads between May and August 2019, which included 15 adolescents (15-17 years) who underwent a dental extraction, and a parent or guardian for each adolescent. The total sample included 30 participants. Interviews were conducted separately for patients and parents. De-identified interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative analysis software using a directed content analysis approach. A total of 15 patient/parent dyads were interviewed. Key themes associated with pain management included sources of information, pain management behaviors engaged in by the adolescents and their caregivers, and the use of medication. In addition to conversations with their dental provider, most patients and their parents discussed pain management plans that included non-medication options, over-the-counter medications, and opioid medications to be taken as needed, which guided their post-extraction behaviors. All participants reported that the adolescent received an opioid prescription for post-extraction pain management, to be taken on an ""as needed"" basis, but most only took it the day of the extraction and up to 2 days following, usually based on the patient's reported pain levels and perceptions of over-the-counter medication adequacy. Participants said they did not receive guidance from their provider concerning disposal of unused opioid medications. Involving adolescents in the pain management decision making process and allowing them to carry out the plan with some caregiver support was acceptable and well executed following third molar extractions. Providers may have an opportunity to reduce the number of opioids prescribed, since respondents reported little to no use of opioids that they were prescribed. Providers should educate patients and their parents about safe disposal of opioids to mitigate the potential for diversion.","Adolescent;Affect;Analgesics;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Caregivers;Comprehension;Decision Making;Dentistry;Future;Health Communication;Humans;Interview;Molar, Third;Opioid Misuse;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Parents;Patients;Perception;Population;Prescriptions;Procedures;Respondents;Software;Telephone;Tooth Extraction",Opioid Misuse;Pain,BMC Pediatr,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35410397,2022,Thalamocortical functional connectivity in infants with prenatal opioid exposure correlates with severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.,"Prenatal opioid exposure (POE) is a growing public health concern due to its associated adverse outcomes including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). The aim of this study was to assess alterations in thalamic functional connectivity in neonates with POE using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and identify whether these altered connectivity measures were associated with NOWS severity. In this prospective, IRB-approved study, we performed rs-fMRI in 19 infants with POE and 20 healthy control infants without POE. Following standard pre-processing, we performed seed-based functional connectivity analysis with the right and left thalamus as the regions of interest. We performed post hoc analysis in the prenatal opioid exposure group to identify associations of altered thalamocortical connectivity with severity of NOWS. P value of &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. There were several regions of significantly altered thalamic to cortical functional connectivity in infants with POE compared to the healthy infants. Distinct regions of thalamocortical functional connectivity correlated with maximum modified Finnegan score. Association between thalamocortical connectivity and severity of NOWS was nominally modified by maternal psychological conditions and polysubstance use. Our findings reveal prenatal opioid exposure-related alterations in thalamic functional connectivity in the infant brain that are correlated with severity of NOWS. Future studies may benefit from evaluation of thalamocortical resting state functional connectivity in infants with POE to help  stratify risk of long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Brain;Ethics Committees, Research;Female;Future;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Opioids;Pregnancy;Prospective Studies;Public Health;Risk;Seeds;Standards;Syndrome;Thalamus;fMRI",Syndrome,Neuroradiology,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35622363,2022,Estimation of the Prevalence of Delayed Dispensing Among Opioid Prescriptions From US Surgeons and Dentists.,"Dispensing of opioid prescriptions from dentists and surgeons more than 30 days after writing, or delayed dispensing, could be a potential indicator that opioids were used for reasons or during a time frame other than that intended by the prescriber. The prevalence of delayed dispensing is unknown. Whether laws can prevent delayed dispensing by shortening the maximum period between prescription writing and dispensing is also unknown. To estimate the prevalence of delayed dispensing among opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists, assess the maximum period US states allow between controlled substance prescription writing and dispensing, and evaluate whether laws shortening this period decrease delayed dispensing of opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists. In this cross-sectional analysis, data from the IQVIA Formulary Impact Analyzer (representing 63% of US prescriptions) were used to identify opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists dispensed from 2014 through 2019. Among opioid prescriptions dispensed in 2019, the proportion with delayed dispensing was calculated. Using legal databases, the maximum state-allowed period between controlled substance prescription writing and dispensing as of December 2019 was examined. Using a difference-in-differences design and 2014 to 2019 data, changes in delayed dispensing prevalence were evaluated among opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists after a Minnesota law was enacted in July 2019 precluding opioid prescription dispensing more than 30 days after writing. Control states allowed dispensing beyond this period. In 2019, the database included 20 858 413 opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists for 14 789 984 patients; 8 582 029 (58.0%) were female. The mean (SD) patient age was 47.1 (19.3) years. Of prescriptions included, 194 452 (0.9%) had delayed dispensing. As of December 2019, the maximum period between drug writing and dispensing was 180 days in 18 and 43 states for Schedule II and III drugs, respectively. Compared with control states, Minnesota's law decreased delayed dispensing prevalence by 0.22 percentage points (95% CI, -0.32 to -0.13 percentage points). In this cross-sectional study, 194 452 opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists were dispensed more than 30 days after writing. To mitigate any prescription opioid misuse associated with delayed dispensing, policy makers could shorten the maximum period between writing and dispensing of opioid prescriptions from surgeons and dentists.","Analgesics, Opioid;Controlled Substances;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Dentists;Female;Formulary;Humans;Indicators;Law;Male;Middle Aged;Minnesota;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy Makers;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Schedules;Surgeons;Time;Writing",Prescription Opioid Misuse,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35815891,2022,Identifying Persistent Opioid Use After Surgery: The Reliability of Pharmacy Dispensation Databases.,"The present study assessed concordance in perioperative opioid fulfillment data between Michigan's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) and a national pharmacy prescription database. PDMPs and pharmacy dispensation databases are widely utilized, yet no research has compared their opioid fulfilment data postoperatively. This retrospective study included participants (N=19,823) from 2 registry studies at Michigan Medicine between July 1, 2016, and February 7, 2019. We assessed the concordance of opioid prescription fulfilment between the Michigan PDMP and a national pharmacy prescription database (Surescripts). The primary outcome was concordance of opioid fill data in the 91 to 180 days after surgical discharge, a time period frequently used to define persistent opioid use. Secondary outcomes included concordance of opioid dose and number of prescriptions fulfilled. Multinomial logistic regression analysis examined concordance across key subgroups. In total, 3076 participants had ≥1 opioid fulfillments 91 to 180 days after discharge, with 1489 (49%) documented in PDMP only, 243 (8%) in Surescripts only, and 1332 (43%) in both databases. Among participants with fulfillments in both databases, there were differences in the number (n=239; 18%) and dose (n=227; 17%). The PDMP database was more likely to capture fulfillment among younger and publicly insured participants, while Surescripts was more likely to capture fulfillment from counties bordering neighboring states. The prevalence of persistent opioid use was 10.7% using PDMP data, 5.5% using Surescripts data only, and 11.7% using both data resources. The state PDMP appears reliable for detecting opioid fulfillment after surgery, detecting 2 times more patients with persistent opioid use compared with Surescripts.",Database;General Surgery;Logistic Regression;Medicine;Michigan;Opioids;Patients;Pharmacies;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Registries;Research;Resources;Retrospective Studies;Time,,Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35839224,2022,Steep rise in drug use-associated infective endocarditis in West Virginia: Characteristics and healthcare utilization.,"Life-threatening infections such as infective endocarditis (IE) are increasing simultaneously with the injection drug use epidemic in West Virginia (WV). We utilized a newly developed, statewide database to describe epidemiologic characteristics and healthcare utilization among patients with (DU-IE) and without (non-DU-IE) drug use-associated IE in WV over five years. This retrospective, observational study, incorporating manual review of electronic medical records, included all patients aged 18-90 years who had their first admission for IE in any of the four university-affiliated referral hospitals in WV during 2014-2018. IE was identified using ICD-10-CM codes and confirmed by chart review. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization were compared between patients with DU-IE and non-DU-IE using Chi-square/Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted with discharge against medical advice/in-hospital mortality vs. discharge alive as the outcome variable and drug use as the predictor variable. Overall 780 unique patients had confirmed first IE admission, with a six-fold increase during study period (p = .004). Most patients (70.9%) had used drugs before hospital admission, primarily by injection. Compared to patients with non-DU-IE, patients with DU-IE were significantly younger (median age: 33.9 vs. 64.1 years; p &lt; .001); were hospitalized longer (median: 25.5 vs. 15 days; p &lt; .001); had a higher proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates (42.7% vs. 29.9%; p &lt; .001), psychiatric disorders (51.2% vs. 17.3%; p &lt; .001), cardiac surgeries (42.9% vs. 26.6%; p &lt; .001), and discharges against medical advice (19.9% vs. 1.4%; p &lt; .001). Multivariable regression analysis showed drug use was an independent predictor of the combined outcome of discharge against medical advice/in-hospital mortality (OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.67-5.64). This multisite study reveals a 681% increase in IE admissions in WV over five years primarily attributable to injection drug use, underscoring the urgent need for both prevention efforts and specialized strategies to improve outcomes.","Adult;Aged;Chart;Database;Demography;Electronic Health Records;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Epidemics;Health Care;Hospital Mortality;Hospital Referral;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-10-CM;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Injections;Life;Logistic Regression;Mental Disorders;Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus;Needs;Observational Study;Overall;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rank-Sum Tests;Regression Analysis;Retrospective Studies;Review;Risk Factors;Staphylococcal Infections;Substance-Related Disorders;Surgery, Cardiac;Universities;West Virginia","Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Mental Disorders;Staphylococcal Infections;Substance-Related Disorders",PLoS One,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35973779,2022,Prospective cohort study on the trajectory and association of perioperative anxiety and postoperative opioid-related outcomes.,"Although perioperative anxiety is common, its trajectory and influence on postoperative pain and opioid use are not well understood. We sought to examine the association and trajectory of perioperative anxiety, pain and opioid use following common surgical procedures. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1771 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. Self-reported opioid use, pain (Brief Pain Inventory) and anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety) were recorded on the day of surgery and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postsurgery. Clinically significant anxiety was defined as a PROMIS Anxiety T-score ≥55. We examined postoperative opioid use in the context of surgical site pain and anxiety using mixed-effects regression models adjusted for covariates, and examined anxiety as a mediator between pain and opioid use. In this cohort, 65% of participants completed all follow-ups and 30% reported clinically significant anxiety at baseline. Anxiety and surgical site pain were highest on the day of surgery (anxiety: mean=49.3, SD=9.0; pain: mean=4.3, SD=3.3) and declined in the follow-up period. Those with anxiety reported higher opioid use (OR=1.40; 95% CI 1.0, 1.9) and 1.14-point increase in patient-reported surgical pain (95% CI 1.0, 1.3) compared with those without anxiety. Anxiety had no significant mediation effect on the relationship of pain and opioid use. Anxiety is an independent risk factor for increased pain and opioid use after surgery. Future studies examining targeted behavioral therapies to reduce anxiety during the perioperative period may positively impact postoperative pain and opioid use.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Association;Cohort Studies;Elective Surgical Procedures;Future;General Surgery;Humans;Information Systems;Inventories;Negotiating;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Perception;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Perioperative Period;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;Self;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Therapeutics","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Reg Anesth Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35984382,2022,A clinical tool to predict severe pain during wound dressing changes.,"Dressing changes cause severe pain (ie, 8-10 on a 10-point scale) for approximately one-third (36%) of patients with open skin wounds. No tool exists that allows nurses to predict which patients are likely to experience severe pain during dressing changes. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical tool to predict severe pain during dressing changes using clinically accessible wound and pain predictors and to evaluate the diagnostic validity of this model. Using a cross-sectional design, a one-time study dressing change was conducted by the same wound care nurse on 445 subjects while concurrently measuring patient and wound predictors and pain intensity during the dressing change. Three predictors came out of the study as most useful for a clinical prediction tool: type of dressing, resting wound pain, and expected pain. Algorithms based on these predictors are presented, which can be applied in other settings to predict patients likely to experience severe pain during a dressing change. This is the first study to systematically examine a comprehensive set of wound and patient predictors for their individual and collective associations with pain during dressing changes using precisely defined and rigorously measured study variables. The ability to predict which patients are likely to have severe pain during dressing changes is critically needed so that they can be targeted for preventive pain control strategies.",Ability;Algorithms;Association;Bandages;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dressings;Humans;Nurses;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Patients;Scales;Skin;Time Studies;Wounds,Pain;Wounds,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36103669,2022,Opioid Coprescribing with Sedatives after Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction.,"Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines are thought to mitigate against postoperative muscle contraction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration warn against coprescribing them with opioids because of increased risks of overdose and death. The authors evaluated the frequency of coprescribing of opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines after implant-based reconstruction. The authors examined health care claims to identify women (18 to 64 years old) who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction between January of 2008 and June of 2019 to determine the frequency of coprescribing, factors associated with coprescribing opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines, and the impact on opioid refills within 90 days of reconstruction. A total of 86.7 percent of women ( n = 7574) who had implant-based breast reconstruction filled an opioid prescription perioperatively. Of these, 27.7 percent of women filled prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines, 14.4 percent for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, and 2.4 percent for opioids, benzodiazepines, and skeletal muscle relaxants. Risk factors for coprescribing opioids and benzodiazepines included use of acellular dermal matrix, immediate reconstruction, and history of anxiety. Women who filled prescriptions for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, opioids and benzodiazepines, and opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to refill opioid prescriptions, even when controlling for preoperative opioid exposure. Nearly half of women filled an opioid prescription with a benzodiazepine, skeletal muscle relaxant, or both after implant-based breast reconstruction. Coprescribing of opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants may potentiate opioid use after surgery and should be avoided given the risks of sedation. Identifying strategies that avoid sedatives to manage pain after breast reconstruction is critical to mitigate high-risk prescribing practices.

36240781,2022,Gut-innervating nociceptors regulate the intestinal microbiota to promote tissue protection.,"Nociceptive pain is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); however, whether pain-sensing neurons influence intestinal inflammation remains poorly defined. Employing chemogenetic silencing, adenoviral-mediated colon-specific silencing, and pharmacological ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors, we observed more severe inflammation and defective tissue-protective reparative processes in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation. Disrupted nociception led to significant alterations in the intestinal microbiota and a transmissible dysbiosis, while mono-colonization of germ-free mice with Gram+Clostridium spp. promoted intestinal tissue protection through a nociceptor-dependent pathway. Mechanistically, disruption of nociception resulted in decreased levels of substance P, and therapeutic delivery of substance P promoted tissue-protective effects exerted by TRPV1+ nociceptors in a microbiota-dependent manner. Finally, dysregulated nociceptor gene expression was observed in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients. Collectively, these findings indicate an evolutionarily conserved functional link between nociception, the intestinal microbiota, and the restoration of intestinal homeostasis.",Animals;Biopsy;Clostridium;Colon;Dysbiosis;Gastrointestinal Microbiome;Gene Expression;Homeostasis;Inflammation;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestinal Microbiome;Mice;Microbiota;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptive Pain;Nociceptors;Pain;Patients;Substance P;Therapeutics;Tissues,Dysbiosis;Inflammation;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Nociceptive Pain;Pain,Cell,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

We evaluated BCBSM administrative claims data from February 1, 2018 - November 16, 2020 for men 20 - 64 years old who underwent vasectomy or a control office-based urologic procedure (cystourethroscopy, prostate biopsy, circumcision, and transurethral destruction of prostate tissue.) The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who filled opioid prescriptions 30 days before to 3 days after their procedure. We performed an interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in the percentage of patients who filled opioid prescriptions in the vasectomy and control group before and after July 1, 1019. Our cohort included 4,559 men who had a vasectomy and 4,679 men who had a control procedure. Within each group, demographics and clinical factors were similar before and after July 1, 2019. Before implementation of the modifier 22 policy, 32.5% of men who had a vasectomy filled an opioid prescription whereas only 12.6% of men filled an opioid prescription after July 1, 2019 -a 19.9% absolute reduction and 61.0% relative reduction (P &lt; .001). In the control group, there was no significant change in the percentage of patients who filled opioid prescriptions before and after July 1, 2019 (0.8% absolute increase, P = .671).

In this study, we describe the in vivo characterization of a novel small molecule/peptidomimetic hybrid compound, C781, as a β-arrestin-biased PAR2 antagonist. In vivo behavioral studies were done in mice using von Frey filaments and the Mouse Grimace Scale. Pharmacokinetic studies were done to assess pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in vivo. We used both prevention and reversal paradigms with protease treatment to determine whether C781 could attenuate protease-evoked pain. C781 effectively prevented and reversed mechanical and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors in response to small molecule PAR2 agonists, mast cell activators, and neutrophil elastase. The ED50 of C781 (intraperitoneal dosing) for inhibition of PAR2 agonist (20.9 ng 2-AT)-evoked nociception was 6.3 mg/kg. C781 was not efficacious in the carrageenan inflammation model. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated limited long-term systemic bioavailability for C781 suggesting that optimizing pharmacokinetic properties could improve in vivo efficacy. Our work demonstrates in vivo efficacy of a biased PAR2 antagonist that selectively inhibits β-arrestin/MAPK signaling downstream of PAR2. Given the importance of this signaling pathway in PAR2-evoked nociception, C781 exemplifies a key pharmacophore for PAR2 that can be optimized for clinical development. PERSPECTIVE: Our work provides evidence that PAR2 antagonists that only block certain aspects of signaling by the receptor can be effective for blocking protease-evoked pain in mice. This is important because it creates a rationale for developing safer PAR2-targeting approaches for pain treatment.","Analgesics;Behavior;Biological Availability;Carrageenan;Hybrids;Inflammation;Leukocyte Elastase;Mast Cells;Mice;News;Nociception;Opioid Crisis;Pain;Pathology;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptidomimetics;Pharmacokinetics;Receptor, PAR-2;Receptors, Proteinase-Activated;Role;Scales;Therapeutics;Work;beta-Arrestins",Inflammation;Pain,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30745219,2019,Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome is defined by signs and symptoms of withdrawal that infants develop after intrauterine maternal drug exposure. All infants with documented in utero opioid exposure, or a high pre-test probability of exposure should have monitoring with a standard assessment instrument such as a Finnegan Score. A Finnegan score of &gt;8 is suggestive of opioid exposure, even in the absence of declared use during pregnancy. At least half of infants in most locales can be treated without the use of pharmacologic means. For this reason, symptom scores will drive the decision for pharmacologic therapy. Nevertheless, all infants, regardless of initial manifestations, should be first be managed with non-pharmacologic approaches which in turn, should not be considered as the sole alternative to drug therapy, but rather, as the base upon which all patients are treated. Those who continue to have symptoms despite supportive care should be pharmacologically treated, which in the most severe cases, is life-saving.","Analgesics, Opioid;Breast Feeding;Buprenorphine;Drive;Drug Therapy;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Life;Methadone;Morphine;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnancy;Probability;Savings;Signs and Symptoms;Standards;Syndrome;Therapeutics",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Syndrome,Semin Fetal Neonatal Med,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
33386337,2021,Site-Level Variation in the Characteristics and Care of Infants With Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal.,"Variation in pediatric medical care is common and contributes to differences in patient outcomes. Site-to-site variation in the characteristics and care of infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) has yet to be quantified. Our objective was to describe site-to-site variation in maternal-infant characteristics, infant management, and outcomes for infants with NOWS. Cross-sectional study of 1377 infants born between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, who were ≥36 weeks' gestation, with NOWS (evidence of opioid exposure and NOWS scoring within the first 120 hours of life) born at or transferred to 1 of 30 participating hospitals nationwide. Site-to-site variation for each parameter within the 3 domains was measured as the range of individual site-level means, medians, or proportions. Sites varied widely in the proportion of infants whose mothers received adequate prenatal care (31.3%-100%), medication-assisted treatment (5.9%-100%), and prenatal counseling (1.9%-75.5%). Sites varied in the proportion of infants with toxicology screening (50%-100%) and proportion of infants receiving pharmacologic therapy (6.7%-100%), secondary medications (1.1%-69.2%), and nonpharmacologic interventions including fortified feeds (2.9%-90%) and maternal breast milk (22.2%-83.3%). The mean length of stay varied across sites (2-28.8 days), as did the proportion of infants discharged with their parents (33.3%-91.1%). Considerable site-to-site variation exists in all 3 domains. The magnitude of the observed variation makes it unlikely that all infants are receiving efficient and effective care for NOWS. This variation should be considered in future clinical trial development, practice implementation, and policy development.","Analgesics, Opioid;Clinical Trial;Combined Modality Therapy;Counseling;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Future;Healthcare Disparities;Hospitals;Humans;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Length of Stay;Life;Male;Milk, Human;Mothers;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioids;Parents;Patients;Pediatrics;Perinatal Care;Policy Development;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Pregnancy;Prenatal Care;Screening;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Toxicology;Treatment Outcome;United States",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Syndrome,Pediatrics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
33632932,2021,Phenobarbital and Clonidine as Secondary Medications for Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome.,"Despite the neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) epidemic in the United States, evidence is limited for pharmacologic management when first-line opioid medications fail to control symptoms. The objective with this study was to evaluate outcomes of infants receiving secondary therapy with phenobarbital compared with clonidine, in combination with morphine, for the treatment of NOWS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants with NOWS from 30 hospitals. The primary outcome measures were the length of hospital stay, duration of opioid treatment, and peak morphine dose. Outcomes were compared by group by using analysis of variance and multivariable linear regression controlling for relevant confounders. Of 563 infants with NOWS treated with morphine, 32% (n = 180) also received a secondary medication. Seventy-two received phenobarbital and 108 received clonidine. After adjustment for covariates, length of hospital stay was 10 days shorter, and, in some models, duration of morphine treatment was 7.5 days shorter in infants receiving phenobarbital compared with those receiving clonidine, with no difference in peak morphine dose. Infants were more likely to be discharged from the hospital on phenobarbital than clonidine (78% vs 29%, P &lt; .0001). Among infants with NOWS receiving morphine and secondary therapy, those treated with phenobarbital had shorter length of hospital stay and shorter morphine treatment duration than clonidine-treated infants but were discharged from the hospital more often on secondary medication. Further investigation is warranted to determine if the benefits of shorter hospital stay and shorter duration of morphine therapy justify the possible neurodevelopmental consequences of phenobarbital use in infants with NOWS.","Adjustment;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Analysis of Variance;Clonidine;Cohort Studies;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Therapy, Combination;Duration of Therapy;Epidemics;Female;Hospital Stay;Hospitals;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Length of Stay;Linear Models;Linear Regression;Male;Morphine;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Phenobarbital;Retrospective Studies;Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Syndrome,Pediatrics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34556799,2022,Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a review of the science and a look toward the use of buprenorphine for affected infants.,"Neonates born to mothers taking opioids during pregnancy are at risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), for which there is no recognized standard approach to care. Nonpharmacologic treatment is typically used as a first-line approach for management, and pharmacologic treatment is added when clinical signs are not responding to nonpharmacologic measures alone. Although morphine and methadone are the most commonly used pharmacotherapies for NOWS, buprenorphine has emerged as a treatment option based on its pharmacologic profile and results from initial single site clinical trials. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of NOWS including a summary of ongoing work in the field and to review the state of the science, knowledge gaps, and practical considerations specific to the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of NOWS as discussed by a panel of experts during a virtual workshop hosted by the National Institutes of Health.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Drug Therapy;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Knowledge;Measures;Methadone;Morphine;Mothers;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pregnancy;Report;Review;Risk;Science;Standards;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Work;Workshops",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid-Related Disorders;Syndrome,J Perinatol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34961756,2022,The cannabinoid agonist CB-13 produces peripherally mediated analgesia in mice but elicits tolerance and signs of central nervous system activity with repeated dosing.,"Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB 1 ) produces analgesia in a variety of preclinical models of pain; however, engagement of central CB 1 receptors is accompanied by unwanted side effects, such as psychoactivity, tolerance, and dependence. Therefore, some efforts to develop novel analgesics have focused on targeting peripheral CB 1 receptors to circumvent central CB 1 -related side effects. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of acute and repeated dosing with the peripherally selective CB 1 -preferring agonist CB-13 on nociception and central CB 1 -related phenotypes in a model of inflammatory pain in mice. We also evaluated cellular mechanisms underlying CB-13-induced antinociception in vitro using cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. CB-13 reduced inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia in male and female mice in a peripheral CB 1 -receptor-dependent manner and relieved inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. In cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons, CB-13 reduced TRPV1 sensitization and neuronal hyperexcitability induced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E 2 , providing potential mechanistic explanations for the analgesic actions of peripheral CB 1 receptor activation. With acute dosing, phenotypes associated with central CB 1 receptor activation occurred only at a dose of CB-13 approximately 10-fold the ED 50 for reducing allodynia. Strikingly, repeated dosing resulted in both analgesic tolerance and CB 1 receptor dependence, even at a dose that did not produce central CB 1 -receptor-mediated phenotypes on acute dosing. This suggests that repeated CB-13 dosing leads to increased CNS exposure and unwanted engagement of central CB 1 receptors. Thus, caution is warranted regarding therapeutic use of CB-13 with the goal of avoiding CNS side effects. Nonetheless, the clear analgesic effect of acute peripheral CB 1 receptor activation suggests that peripherally restricted cannabinoids are a viable target for novel analgesic development.","Allodynia;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists;Cannabinoids;Central Nervous System;Dinoprostone;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Goals;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;In Vitro;Inflammation;Lead;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Naphthalenes;Neurons;Nociception;Pain;Phenotype;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1;Receptors, Cannabinoid;Therapeutic Uses","Allodynia;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32060963,2020,Lumbar intervertebral disc characterization through quantitative MRI analysis: An automatic voxel-based relaxometry approach.,"To develop an automated pipeline based on convolutional neural networks to segment lumbar intervertebral discs and characterize their biochemical composition using voxel-based relaxometry, and establish local associations with clinical measures of disability, muscle changes, and other symptoms of lower back pain. This work proposes a new methodology using MRI (n = 31, across the spectrum of disc degeneration) that combines deep learning-based segmentation, atlas-based registration, and statistical parametric mapping for voxel-based analysis of T1ρ and T2 relaxation time maps to characterize disc degeneration and its associated disability. Across degenerative grades, the segmentation algorithm produced accurate, high-confidence segmentations of the lumbar discs in two independent data sets. Manually and automatically extracted mean disc T1ρ and T2 relaxation times were in high agreement for all discs with minimal bias. On a voxel-by-voxel basis, imaging-based degenerative grades were strongly negatively correlated with T1ρ and T2 , particularly in the nucleus. Stratifying patients by disability grades revealed significant differences in the relaxation maps between minimal/moderate versus severe disability: The average T1ρ relaxation maps from the minimal/moderate disability group showed clear annulus nucleus distinction with a visible midline, whereas the severe disability group had lower average T1ρ values with a homogeneous distribution. This work presented a scalable pipeline for fast, automated assessment of disc relaxation times, and voxel-based relaxometry that overcomes limitations of current region of interest-based analysis methods and may enable greater insights and associations between disc degeneration, disability, and lower back pain.",Algorithms;Association;Atlas;Bias;Dataset;Deep Learning;Humans;Intervertebral Disc;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Lumbosacral Region;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Map;Measures;Methods;Muscles;News;Patients;Relaxation;Spine;Time;Work,Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain,Magn Reson Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32471173,2020,Serum Biomarkers for Connective Tissue and Basement Membrane Remodeling are Associated with Vertebral Endplate Bone Marrow Lesions as Seen on MRI (Modic Changes).,"Vertebral endplate bone marrow lesions, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as Modic changes (MC), are associated with chronic low back pain (cLBP). Since guidelines recommend against routine spinal MRI for cLBP in primary care, MC may be underdiagnosed. Serum biomarkers for MC would allow early diagnosis, inform clinical care decisions, and supplement treatment monitoring. We aimed to discover biomarkers in the blood serum that correlate with MC pathophysiological processes. For this single-site cross-sectional study, we recruited 54 subjects with 38 cLBP patients and 16 volunteers without a history of LBP. All subjects completed an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire and 10-cm Visual Analog Score (VAS) for LBP (VASback) and leg pain. Lumbar T1-weighted and fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI were acquired at 3T and used for MC classification in each endplate. Blood serum was collected on the day of MRI. Biomarkers related to disc resorption and bone marrow fibrosis were analyzed with enzyme-linked immune-absorbent assays. The concentration of biomarkers between no MC and any type of MC (AnyMC), MC1, and MC2 were compared. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics were calculated for each biomarker and for bivariable biomarker models. We found that biomarkers related to type III and type IV collagen degradation and formation tended to correlate with the presence of MC (p = 0.060-0.088). The bivariable model with the highest AUC was PRO-C3 + C4M and had a moderate diagnostic value for AnyMC in cLBP patients (AUC = 0.73, specificity = 78.9%, sensitivity = 73.7%). In conclusion, serum biomarkers related to the formation and degradation of type III and type IV collagen, which are key molecules in bone marrow fibrosis, correlated with MC presence. Bone marrow fibrosis may be an important pathophysiological process in MC that should be targeted in larger biomarker and treatment studies.",Adult;Area Under Curve;Back Pain;Basement Membrane;Biomarkers;Bone Marrow;Classification;Collagen Type IV;Complement C3 Precursor;Connective Tissue;Cross-Sectional Studies;Early Diagnosis;Enzymes;Fats;Female;Guideline;History;Humans;Index;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Leg;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Pain;Patients;Primary Health Care;Primary Myelofibrosis;Questionnaires;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Sensitivity;Serum;Specificity;Therapeutics;Volunteers,Back Pain;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain;Pain;Primary Myelofibrosis,Int J Mol Sci,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32592504,2021,"Evaluation of human cartilage endplate composition using MRI: Spatial variation, association with adjacent disc degeneration, and in vivo repeatability.","Cartilage endplate (CEP) biochemical composition may influence disc degeneration and regeneration. However, evaluating CEP composition in patients remains a challenge. We used T2* mapping from ultrashort echo-time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is sensitive to CEP hydration, to investigate spatial variations in CEP T2* values and to determine how CEP T2* values correlate with adjacent disc degeneration. Thirteen human cadavers (56.4 ± 12.7 years) and seven volunteers (36.9 ± 10.9 years) underwent 3T MRI, including UTE and T1ρ mapping sequences. Spatial mappings of T2* values in L4-S1 CEPs were generated from UTE images and compared between subregions. In the abutting discs, mean T1ρ values in the nucleus pulposus were compared between CEPs with high vs low T2* values. To assess in vivo repeatability, precision errors in mean T2* values, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were measured from repeat scans. Results showed that CEP T2* values were highest centrally and lowest posteriorly. In the youngest individuals (&lt;50 years), who had mild-to-moderately degenerated Pfirrmann grade II-III discs, low CEP T2* values associated with severer disc degeneration: T1ρ values were 26.7% lower in subjects with low CEP T2* values (P = .025). In older individuals, CEP T2* values did not associate with disc degeneration (P = .39-.62). Precision errors in T2* ranged from 1.7 to 2.6 ms, and reliability was good-to-excellent (ICC = 0.89-0.94). These findings suggest that deficits in CEP composition, as indicated by low T2* values, associate with severer disc degeneration during the mild-to-moderate stages. Measuring CEP T2* values with UTE MRI may clarify the role of CEP composition in patients with mild-to-moderate disc degeneration.",Adult;Aged;Aging;Association;Cadaver;Cartilage;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Intervertebral Disc;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Nucleus Pulposus;Patients;Regeneration;Reproducibility of Results;Role;Time;Volunteers,Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain,J Orthop Res,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
33313724,2020,A Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) for Stepped Care Management of Low Back Pain in the Military Health System: A Trial Protocol.,"The Defense Health Agency has prioritized system-level pain management initiatives within the Military Health System (MHS), with low back pain as one of the key focus areas. A stepped care model focused on nonpharmacologic treatment to promote self-management is recommended. Implementation of stepped care is complicated by lack of information on the most effective nonpharmacologic strategies and how to sequence and tailor the various available options. The Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomization Trial for Low Back Pain (SMART LBP) is a multisite pragmatic trial using a SMART design to assess the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic low back pain. This SMART trial has two treatment phases. Participants from three military treatment facilities are randomized to 6 weeks of phase I treatment, receiving either physical therapy (PT) or Army Medicine's holistic Move2Health (M2H) program in a package specific to low back pain. Nonresponders to treatment in phase I are again randomized to phase II treatment of combined M2H + PT or mindfulness-based treatment using the Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) program. The primary outcome is the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference computer-adapted test score. This trial is part of an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health, Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense to establish a national infrastructure for effective system-level management of chronic pain with a focus on nonpharmacologic treatments.

33547944,2021,Measurement of vertebral endplate bone marrow lesion (Modic change) composition with water-fat MRI and relationship to patient-reported outcome measures.,"Vertebral endplate bone marrow lesions (""Modic changes"", MC) are associated with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Bone marrow composition in MC is poorly understood. The goals of this study were to: (1) measure bone marrow fat fraction (BMF) in CLBP patients with MC using water-fat MRI and (2) assess the relationship between BMF measurements and patient-reported clinical characteristics. In this cross-sectional study, 42 CLBP patients (men, n = 21; age, 48 ± 12.4 years) and 18 asymptomatic controls (men, n = 10; 42.7 ± 12.8 years) underwent 3 T MRI between January 2016 and July 2018. Imaging consisted of T1- and T2-weighted sequences to evaluate MC and spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence with asymmetric echoes and least-squares fitting to measure BMF. BMF was compared between vertebrae with and without MC using mixed effects models. The relationship between the BMF measurements and patient-reported disability scores was examined using regression. Twenty-seven subjects (26 CLBP, 1 control) had MC, and MC presence coincided with significantly altered BMF. In MC 1, BMF was lower than endplates without MC (absolute difference -22.3%; p &lt; 0.001); in MC 2, BMF was higher (absolute difference 21.0%; p &lt; 0.001). Absolute BMF differences between affected and unaffected marrow were larger in patients with greater disability (p = 0.029-0.032) and were not associated with pain (p = 0.49-0.83).

Virtual reality (VR) is a digital therapeutic known to be effective for acute pain, but its role in chronic pain is not yet fully elucidated. Here we present a protocol for the National Institute of Health (NIH) Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) VR trial that evaluates the effectiveness of three forms of VR for patients with chronic lower back pain (cLBP), a highly prevalent form of chronic pain. The NIH BACPAC VR trial will randomise 360 patients with cLBP into one of three arms, each administered through a head-mounted display: 1) skills-based VR, a program incorporating principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, mindful meditation and physiological biofeedback therapy using embedded biometric sensors; 2) distraction-based VR, a program using 360-degree immersive videos designed to distract users from pain; and 3) sham VR, a non-immersive program using two-dimensional videos within a VR headset. Research participants will be monitored for 12 weeks using a combination of patient-reported outcomes administered via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), wearable sensor data collected via Fitbit Charge 4 and electronic health record data. The primary outcome will be the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference scale. Secondary outcomes will include PROMIS Anxiety, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, opioid prescription data and Pain Catastrophizing Scale Short Form. A subgroup analysis will explore patient level predictors for VR efficacy. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Cedars-Sinai Health System in April 2020.

34845751,2022,Institution-wide shape analysis of 3D spinal curvature and global alignment parameters.,"The spine is an articulated, 3D structure with 6 degrees of translational and rotational freedom. Clinical studies have shown spinal deformities are associated with pain and functional disability in both adult and pediatric populations. Clinical decision making relies on accurate characterization of the spinal deformity and monitoring of its progression over time. However, Cobb angle measurements are time-consuming, are limited by interobserver variability, and represent a simplified 2D view of a 3D structure. Instead, spine deformities can be described by 3D shape parameters, addressing the limitations of current measurement methods. To this end, we develop and validate a deep learning algorithm to automatically extract the vertebral midline (from the upper endplate of S1 to the lower endplate of C7) for frontal and lateral radiographs. Our results demonstrate robust performance across datasets and patient populations. Approximations of 3D spines are reconstructed from the unit normalized midline curves of 20,118 pairs of full spine radiographs belonging to 15,378 patients acquired at our institution between 2008 and 2020. The resulting 3D dataset is used to describe global imbalance parameters in the patient population and to build a statistical shape model to describe global spine shape variations in preoperative deformity patients via eight interpretable shape parameters. The developed method can identify patient subgroups with similar shape characteristics without relying on an existing shape classification system.","Adult;Algorithms;Child;Classification;Clinical Decision-Making;Clinical Study;Congenital Abnormalities;Dataset;Deep Learning;Diagnostic Imaging;Freedom;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Interobserver Variation;Methods;Observer Variation;Pain;Patients;Pediatrics;Population;Radiography;Scoliosis;Spinal Curvatures;Spine;Thoracic Vertebrae;Time",Congenital Abnormalities;Pain;Scoliosis;Spinal Curvatures,J Orthop Res,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35285561,2022,Paraspinal Muscle in Chronic Low Back Pain: Comparison Between Standard Parameters and Chemical Shift Encoding-Based Water-Fat MRI.,"Paraspinal musculature (PSM) is increasingly recognized as a contributor to low back pain (LBP), but with conventional MRI sequences, assessment is limited. Chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) enables the measurement of PSM fat fraction (FF), which may assist investigations of chronic LBP. To investigate associations between PSM parameters from conventional MRI and CSE-MRI and between PSM parameters and pain. Prospective, cross-sectional. Eighty-four adults with chronic LBP (44.6 ± 13.4 years; 48 males). 3-T, T1-weighted fast spin-echo and iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least squares estimation sequences. T1-weighted images for Goutallier classification (GC), muscle volume, lumbar indentation value, and muscle-fat index, CSE-MRI for FF extraction (L1/2-L5/S1). Pain was self-reported using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Intra- and/or interreader agreement was assessed for MRI-derived parameters. Mixed-effects and linear regression models to 1) assess relationships between PSM parameters (entire cohort and subgroup with GC grades 0 and 1; statistical significance α = 0.0025) and 2) evaluate associations of PSM parameters with pain (α = 0.05). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intra- and/or interreader agreement. The FF showed excellent intra- and interreader agreement (ICC range: 0.97-0.99) and was significantly associated with GC at all spinal levels. Subgroup analysis suggested that early/subtle changes in PSM are detectable with FF but not with GC, given the absence of significant associations between FF and GC (P-value range: 0.036 at L5/S1 to 0.784 at L2/L3). Averaged over all spinal levels, FF and GC were significantly associated with VAS scores. In the absence of FF, GC may be the best surrogate for PSM quality. Given the ability of CSE-MRI to detect muscle alterations at early stages of PSM degeneration, this technique may have potential for further investigations of the role of PSM in chronic LBP. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.",Ability;Adult;Association;Classification;Cross-Sectional Studies;Fats;Humans;Index;Least-Squares Analysis;Linear Regression;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Muscles;Pain;Paraspinal Muscles;Prospective Studies;Role;Self;Standards;Visual Analog Scale;Water,Low Back Pain;Pain,J Magn Reson Imaging,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35333958,2022,Using hierarchical unsupervised learning to integrate and reduce multi-level and multi-paraspinal muscle MRI data in relation to low back pain.,"The paraspinal muscles (PSM) are a key feature potentially related to low back pain (LBP), and their structure and composition can be quantified using MRI. Most commonly, quantifying PSM measures across individual muscles and individual spinal levels renders numerous separate metrics that are analyzed in isolation. However, comprehensive multivariate approaches would be more appropriate for analyzing the PSM within an individual. To establish and test these methods, we hypothesized that multivariate summaries of PSM MRI measures would associate with the presence of LBP symptoms (i.e., pain intensity). We applied hierarchical multiple factor analysis (hMFA), an unsupervised integrative method, to clinical PSM MRI data from unique cohort datasets including a longitudinal cohort of astronauts with pre- and post-spaceflight data and a cohort of chronic LBP subjects and asymptomatic controls. Three specific use cases were investigated: (1) predicting longitudinal changes in pain using combinations of baseline PSM measures; (2) integrating baseline and post-spaceflight MRI to assess longitudinal change in PSM and how it relates to pain; and (3) integrating PSM quality and adjacent spinal pathology between LBP patients and controls. Overall, we found distinct complex relationships with pain intensity between particular muscles and spinal levels. Subjects with high asymmetry between left and right lean muscle composition and differences between spinal segments PSM quality and structure are more likely to increase in pain reported outcome after prolonged time in microgravity. Moreover, changes in PSM quality and structure between pre and post-spaceflight relate to increase in pain after prolonged microgravity. Finally, we show how unsupervised hMFA recapitulates previous research on the association of CEP damage and LBP diagnostic. Our analysis considers the spine as a multi-segmental unit as opposed to a series of discrete and isolated spine segments. Integrative and multivariate approaches can be used to distill large and complex imaging datasets thereby improving the clinical utility of MRI-based biomarkers, and providing metrics for further analytical goals, including phenotyping.","Analysis, Factor;Association;Astronauts;Biomarkers;Dataset;Goals;Humans;Learning;Low Back Pain;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Methods;Metric;Microgravity;Muscles;Overall;Pain;Paraspinal Muscles;Pathology;Patients;Research;Space Flight;Spine;Time;Unsupervised Machine Learning;Weightlessness",Low Back Pain;Pain,Eur Spine J,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

However, the relative contributions of these factors to disc degeneration in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) have not been quantified. The goal of this study was to use compositional biomarkers derived from quantitative MRI to establish how CEP composition (surrogate for permeability) and vertebral bone marrow fat fraction (BMFF, surrogate for perfusion) relate to disc degeneration. MRI data from 60 patients with cLBP were included in this prospective observational study (28 female, 32 male; age = 40.0 ± 11.9 years, 19-65 [mean ± SD, min-max]). Ultra-short echo-time MRI was used to calculate CEP T2* relaxation times (reflecting biochemical composition), water-fat MRI was used to calculate vertebral BMFF, and T1ρ MRI was used to calculate T1ρ relaxation times in the nucleus pulposus (NP T1ρ, reflecting proteoglycan content and degenerative grade). Univariate linear regression was used to assess the independent effects of CEP T2* and vertebral BMFF on NP T1ρ. Mixed effects multivariable linear regression accounting for age, sex, and BMI was used to assess the combined relationship between variables. CEP T2* and vertebral BMFF were independently associated with NP T1ρ (p = 0.003 and 0.0001, respectively). After adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, NP T1ρ remained significantly associated with CEP T2* (p = 0.0001) but not vertebral BMFF (p = 0.43). Poor CEP composition plays a significant role in disc degeneration severity and can affect disc health both with and without deficits in vertebral perfusion.",Accounting;Adult;Affect;Biomarkers;Bone Marrow;Cartilage;Diffusion;Fats;Female;Goals;Health;Humans;Intervertebral Disc;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Linear Regression;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Nucleus Pulposus;Nutrients;Observational Study;Patients;Perfusion;Permeability;Play;Proteoglycans;Relatives;Relaxation;Role;Sex;Time;Water,Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain,Eur Spine J,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35776179,2022,Spatial distribution of fat infiltration within the paraspinal muscles: implications for chronic low back pain.,"Fat infiltration (FI) of the paraspinal muscles (PSMs) measured using MRI is an aspect of muscle quality and is considered to be worse in chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients. However, there is not a clear association between paraspinal muscle FI and cLBP, leaving the clinical importance of paraspinal muscle composition unestablished. The spatial distribution of FI in the PSMs may inform mechanistic understanding of non-specific cLBP as it relates to degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD) pathology. We hypothesized that paraspinal muscle fat-mapping would reveal distinct FI distribution patterns in relation to cLBP symptoms and proximity to symptomatic IVD degeneration. From advanced-sequence water-fat MRI of 40 axial cLBP patients and 21 controls, we examined the spatial distribution of paraspinal muscle FI in relation to the center of rotation at the L4L5 disc. Using statistical parametric mapping, we compared FI patterns for multifidus (MF), erector spinae (ES), and psoas between patients and controls, and to the presence and severity of adjacent degenerative IVD pathology. The spatial distribution of PSMs FI differs between PSMs and according to symptoms and the adjacent degenerative IVD pathology. Furthermore, the region of MF closest to the disc center of rotation appears most susceptible to FI in the presence of symptomatic IVD degeneration. Our study identified spatial distribution patterns of FI in the PSMs as a potential diagnostic biomarker that may also provide granular mechanistic insights into spine biomechanics related to cLBP, as well as advancing the use of prior summary measures limited to overall muscle FI.",Association;Biomarkers;Biomechanical Phenomena;Comprehension;Degenerative Intervertebral Discs;Fats;Humans;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Multifidus;Muscles;Overall;Paraspinal Muscles;Pathology;Patients;Rotation;Spine;Water,Degenerative Intervertebral Discs;Low Back Pain,Eur Spine J,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36069630,2022,The Effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention Integrated with Physical Therapy (MIND-PT) for Post-Surgical Rehabilitation after Lumbar Surgery: A Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial as Part of the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program.,"Improving pain management for persons with chronic low back pain (LBP) undergoing surgery is an important consideration to improve patient-centered outcomes and reduce the risk for persistent opioid use following surgery. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including physical therapy and mindfulness, are beneficial for non-surgical LBP through complementary biopsychosocial mechanisms; but their integration and application for persons undergoing surgery for LBP have not been examined. This study (MIND-PT) is a multi-site randomized trial that compares an enriched pain management (EPM) pathway integrating physical therapy and mindfulness to usual care pain management (UC) for persons undergoing surgery for LBP. Participants from military treatment facilities will be enrolled pre-surgery and individually randomized to the EPM or UC pain management pathway. Participants assigned to EPM will receive pre-surgical biopsychosocial education and mindfulness instruction. After surgery the EPM group will receive 10 sessions of physical therapy with integrated mindfulness techniques. Participants assigned to the UC group will receive usual pain management care after surgery. The primary outcome will be the pain impact assessed with the Pain, Enjoyment and General Activity (PEG) scale. Time to opioid discontinuation is the main secondary outcome. This trial is part of the National Institutes of Health, Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative focused on providing scientific solutions to the opioid crisis.

36069660,2022,Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine-recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group.,"Management of patients suffering from low back pain (LBP) is challenging and requires development of diagnostic techniques to identify specific patient subgroups and phenotypes in order to customize treatment and predict clinical outcome. The Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Spine Imaging Working Group has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for spinal imaging protocols to be used in all BACPAC studies. These SOPs include procedures to conduct spinal imaging assessments with guidelines for standardizing the collection, reading/grading (using structured reporting with semi-quantitative evaluation using ordinal rating scales), and storage of images. This article presents the approach to image acquisition and evaluation recommended by the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group. While the approach is specific to BACPAC studies, it is general enough to be applied at other centers performing MRI acquisitions in patients with LBP. The herein presented SOPs are meant to improve understanding of pain mechanisms and facilitate patient phenotyping by codifying MRI-based methods that provide standardized, non-invasive assessments of spinal pathologies. Finally, these recommended procedures may facilitate the integration of better harmonized MRI data of the lumbar spine across studies and sites within and outside of BACPAC studies.",Back Pain;Collection;Comprehension;Guideline;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Methods;Pain;Pathology;Patients;Phenotype;Procedures;Quantitative Evaluation;Reading;Scales;Spine;Standards;Therapeutics,Back Pain;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Low Back Pain;Pain,Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36203645,2022,Evidence-based interventions to treat chronic low back pain: treatment selection for a personalized medicine approach.,"Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is highly prevalent in the United States and globally, resulting in functional impairment and lowered quality of life. While many treatments are available for cLBP, clinicians have little information about which specific treatment(s) will work best for individual patients or subgroups of patients. The Back Pain Research Consortium, part of the National Institutes of Health Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM (HEAL) Initiative, will conduct a collaborative clinical trial, which seeks to develop a personalized medicine algorithm to optimize patient and provider treatment selection for patients with cLBP. The primary objective of this article is to provide an update on evidence-based cLBP interventions and describe the process of reviewing and selecting interventions for inclusion in the clinical trial. A working group of cLBP experts reviewed and selected interventions for inclusion in the clinical trial. The primary evaluation measures were strength of evidence and magnitude of treatment effect. When available in the literature, duration of effect, onset time, carryover effect, multimodal efficacy, responder subgroups, and evidence for the mechanism of treatment effect or biomarkers were considered. The working group selected 4 leading, evidence-based treatments for cLBP to be tested in the clinical trial and for use in routine clinical treatment. These treatments include (1) duloxetine, (2) acceptance and commitment therapy, (3) a classification-based exercise and manual therapy intervention, and (4) a self-management approach. These interventions each had a moderate to high level of evidence to support a therapeutic effect and were from different therapeutic classes.",Acceptance and Commitment Therapy;Algorithms;Back Pain;Biomarkers;Classification;Clinical Trial;Duloxetine;Exercise;Literature;Low Back Pain;Manual Therapies;Measures;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Patients;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Precision Medicine;Quality of Life;Research;Selection for Treatment;Self-Management;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Work,Back Pain;Low Back Pain,Pain Rep,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36308543,2022,An unexpected connection: A narrative review of the associations between Gut Microbiome and Musculoskeletal Pain.,"Multiple diverse factors contribute to musculoskeletal pain, a major cause of physical dysfunction and health-related costs worldwide. Rapidly growing evidence demonstrates that the gut microbiome has overarching influences on human health and the body's homeostasis and resilience to internal and external perturbations. This broad role of the gut microbiome is potentially relevant and connected to musculoskeletal pain, though the literature on the topic is limited. Thus, the literature on the topic of musculoskeletal pain and gut microbiome was explored. This narrative review explores the vast array of reported metabolites associated with inflammation and immune-metabolic response, which are known contributors to musculoskeletal pain. Moreover, it covers known modifiable (e.g., diet, lifestyle choices, exposure to prescription drugs, pollutants, and chemicals) and non-modifiable factors (e.g., gut architecture, genetics, age, birth history, and early feeding patterns) that are known to contribute to changes to the gut microbiome. Particular attention is devoted to modifiable factors, as the ultimate goal of researching this topic is to implement gut microbiome health interventions into clinical practice. Overall, numerous associations exist in the literature that could converge on the gut microbiome's pivotal role in musculoskeletal health. Particularly, a variety of metabolites that are either directly produced or indirectly modulated by the gut microbiome have been highlighted. The review highlights noticeable connections between the gut and musculoskeletal health, thus warranting future research to focus on the gut microbiome's role in musculoskeletal conditions.",Architecture;Association;Attention;Birth History;Cost;Diet;Environmental Pollutants;Feeding Patterns;Future;Gastrointestinal Microbiome;Genetics;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Humans;Inflammation;Life Style;Literature;Musculoskeletal Pain;Overall;Pain;Prescription Drugs;Research;Review;Role,Inflammation;Musculoskeletal Pain;Pain,Eur Spine J,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
28723302,2018,Why use group visits for opioid use disorder treatment in primary care? A patient-centered qualitative study.,"Primary care providers are well positioned to respond to the opioid crisis by providing buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) through shared medical appointments (SMAs). Although quantitative research has been previously conducted on SMAs with B/N, the authors conducted a qualitative assessment from the patients' point of view, considering whether and how group visits provide value for patients. Twenty-five participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) who were enrolled in a weekly B/N group visit at a family medicine clinic participated in either of two 1-hour-long focus groups, which were conducted as actual group visits. Participants were prompted with the question ""How has this group changed you as a person?"" Data were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed and analyzed using a qualitative thematic approach, identifying common communication behaviors and resulting attitudes about the value of the group visit model. Participants demonstrated several communication behaviors that support group members in their recovery, including offering direct emotional support to others struggling with difficult experiences, making an intentional effort to probe about others' lives, venting about heavy situations, joking to lighten the mood, and expressing feelings of gratitude to the entire group. These communication behaviors appear to act as mechanisms to foster a sense of accountability, a shared identity, and a supportive community. Other demonstrated group behaviors may detract from the value of the group experience, including side conversations, tangential comments, and individual participants disproportionately dominating group time. The group visit format for delivering B/N promotes group-specific communication behaviors that may add unique value in supporting patients in their recovery. Future research should elucidate whether these benefits can be isolated from those achieved solely through medication treatment with B/N and if similar benefits could be achieved in non-primary care sites.","Accountability;Adult;Appointments and Schedules;Attitude;Behavior;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Comment;Communication;Community;Family;Feelings;Female;Focus Groups;Future;Humans;Male;Medicine;Middle Aged;Mood;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Primary Health Care;Qualitative Research;Research;Self-Help Groups;Shared Medical Appointments;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
29195596,2018,Group-based treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine: A systematic review.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health crisis in the U.S., and there is a need to develop effective clinical treatment strategies. Coupling buprenorphine/naloxone (B/N) maintenance with counseling is encouraged as a best practice, yet the efficacy research on individual counseling in B/N-based Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) has been equivocal to date. In contrast, models for integrating B/N prescribing through group-based counseling could potentially have a differential impact, yet no systematic reviews have focused on examining the extent of the literature on group-based models of B/N delivery. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify existing studies characterizing the different formats of Group-Based Opioid Treatment (GBOT), which we defined as the coupling of B/N prescribing with required office-based group counseling. Using this definition of GBOT, B/N prescribing could occur either concurrently during a medical visit with group counseling (i.e., Shared Medical Appointment) or asynchronously (i.e., Group Psychotherapy). We assessed for all available scientific literature reporting on the feasibility, acceptability and/or efficacy of these different forms of GBOT. The systematic review protocol used PRISMA standards. We included 10 peer-reviewed, full-text articles and 5 conference abstracts of office-based opioid use disorder treatment that reported data on the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of Group-Based Opioid Treatment with B/N. Of the ten full-text articles we included 4 studies describing a shared medical appointment (SMA) model and 6 studies describing a group psychotherapy model. Of these studies, all were low in quality due to study design and only three were randomized controlled trials. No studies were appropriately designed to rigorously compare the efficacy of a GBOT approach (i.e., B/N prescribing with required group-based counseling) versus B/N prescribing with required individual counseling; nor were they designed for rigorous comparison with medication management alone. Nevertheless, most studies reported on the feasibility and acceptability of various models representative of a GBOT approach. The small number of studies and study design limited the conclusions that could be drawn about the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of group-based B/N treatment. More research is needed to determine whether benefits exist of GBOT with B/N.","Abstracts;Analgesics, Opioid;Appointments and Schedules;Best Practices;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Classification;Conferences;Counseling;Dates;Form;Humans;Literature;Maintenance;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Psychotherapy, Group;Public Health;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Review;Shared Medical Appointments;Standards;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31174929,2020,A pilot study of mindful body awareness training as an adjunct to office-based medication treatment of opioid use disorder.,"The purpose of this study was to pilot-test a mind-body intervention called Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT) as an adjunct to buprenorphine for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). MABT, a manualized 8 week protocol, teaches interoceptive awareness skills to promote self-care and emotion regulation. A small study was designed to assess MABT recruitment and retention feasibility, and intervention acceptability, among this population. Individuals were recruited from two office-based programs providing buprenorphine treatment within a large urban community medical center. Participants were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU plus MABT. Assessments administered at baseline and 10-week follow-up included validated self-report health questionnaires and a process measure, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, to examine interoceptive awareness skills. An additional survey and exit interview for those in the MABT study arm were administered to assess intervention satisfaction. Results showed the ability to recruit and enroll 10 participants within two-weeks, and no loss to follow-up. The MABT study group showed an increase in interoceptive awareness skills from baseline to follow-up, whereas the control group did not. Responses to the satisfaction questionnaire and exit interview were positive, indicating skills learned, satisfaction with the interventionists, and overall perceived benefit of the intervention. In summary, study results demonstrated recruitment and retention feasibility, and high intervention acceptability. This pilot study suggests preliminary feasibility of successfully implementing a larger study of MABT as an adjunct to office-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder.","Ability;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Arm;Awareness;Buprenorphine;Community;Control Groups;Emotional Regulation;Female;Grants;Health;Humans;Interoception;Interview;Male;Mind-Body Therapies;Mindfulness;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Patient Satisfaction;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Population;Process Measures;Program;Questionnaires;Satisfaction;Self Care;Self Report;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31404850,2019,Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement reduces opioid craving among individuals with opioid use disorder and chronic pain in medication assisted treatment: Ecological momentary assessments from a stage 1 randomized controlled trial.,"Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is an efficacious form of medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), yet many individuals on MMT relapse. Chronic pain and deficits in positive affective response to natural rewards may result in dysphoria that fuels opioid craving and promotes relapse. As such, behavioral therapies that ameliorate chronic pain and enhance positive affect may serve as useful adjuncts to MMT. This analysis of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from a Stage 1 randomized clinical trial examined effects of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) on opioid craving, pain, and positive affective state. Participants with OUD and chronic pain (N = 30) were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or treatment as usual (TAU). Across 8 weeks of treatment, participants completed up to 112 random EMA measures of craving, pain, and affect, as well as event-contingent craving ratings. Multilevel models examined the effects of MORE on craving, pain, and affect, as well as the association between positive affect and craving. EMA showed significantly greater improvements in craving, pain unpleasantness, stress, and positive affect for participants in MORE than for participants in TAU. Participants in MORE reported having nearly 1.3 times greater self-control over craving than those in TAU. Further, positive affect was associated with reduced craving, an association that was significantly stronger among participants in MORE than TAU. MORE may be a useful non-pharmacological adjunct among individuals with OUD and chronic pain in MMT.","Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Combined Modality Therapy;Craving;Ecological Momentary Assessment;Female;Form;Humans;Maintenance;Male;Measures;Methadone;Middle Aged;Mindfulness;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Randomized Controlled Trial;Relapse;Reward;Self-Control;Therapeutics;Time;Young Adult",Chronic Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Relapse,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32004328,2020,Adapting a peer recovery coach-delivered behavioral activation intervention for problematic substance use in a medically underserved community in Baltimore City.,"Low-income, racial/ethnic minority groups have disproportionately high rates of problematic substance use yet face barriers in accessing evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), individuals with lived experience with problematic substance use, may provide an effective approach to reaching these individuals. Traditionally PRCs have focused on bridging to other types of care rather than delivering EBIs themselves. The aim of this study was to assess perceptions of the appropriateness of a PRC-delivered adapted behavioral activation (BA) intervention to reduce problematic substance use for individuals not engaged in care. This study was conducted at a community resource center in Baltimore, Maryland serving low-income and homeless clients who have high rates of problematic substance use yet also face barriers to accessing care. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted semi-structured key informant interviews with clients (n = 30) with past or present problematic substance use, and a focus group with community providers, including staff at the community resource center (n = 5) and PRCs (n = 6) from the community. Thirty percent (n = 9) of clients interviewed reported past problematic substance use and 70% (n = 21) met criteria for current use, most commonly cocaine and opioids. Clients, center staff, and PRCs shared that PRC-delivered BA could be acceptable and appropriate with suggested adaptations, including adding peer-delivered case-management and linkage to care alongside BA, and tailoring BA to include activities that are accessible and feasible in the community. These findings will inform the adaptation of PRC-delivered BA to address problematic substance use in this setting.",Address;Adult;Baltimore;Behavior Therapy;Case Management;Cities;Clients;Cocaine;Community;Community Medicine;Ethnic Groups;Face;Focus Groups;Homeless Persons;Humans;Income;Interview;Male;Maryland;Medically Underserved Area;Middle Aged;Minority Groups;Opioids;Peer Group;Perception;Poverty;Resources;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,PLoS One,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

33892281,2021,Peer-delivered services for substance use in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review.,"Addressing the burden of disease associated with substance use is a global priority, yet access to treatment is limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Peers, individuals with lived experience of substance use, may play an important role in expanding access to treatment, supporting outcomes, and reducing stigma. While peer-delivered services for substance use have been scaling up in high-income countries (HICs), less is known about their application in LMICs. This systematic review synthesizes the evidence of peer-delivered services for substance use in LMICs. PsycINFO, Embase, Global Health, PubMed, and six region-specific databases were searched, and articles that described peer-delivered services for substance use and related outcomes in LMICs were included. Risk of bias was evaluated using tools appropriate for each study design. To provide a more stringent evaluation of structured interventions, a subset of articles was analyzed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) framework. The search yielded 6540 articles. These were narrowed down to 34 included articles. Articles spanned four continents, included quantitative and qualitative methodologies, and primarily targeted infectious disease risk behaviors. Ten articles were included in the EPOC sub-analysis. In the context of high risk of bias, some of these articles demonstrated positive impacts of the peer-delivered services, including reductions in risk behaviors and increases in infectious disease knowledge scores, while many others showed no significant difference in outcomes between peer intervention and control groups. Peer-delivered services may be feasible for addressing substance use and reducing infectious disease risk behaviors in LMICs, where there are severe human resource shortages. Globally, peers' lived experience is valuable for engaging patients in substance use treatment and harm reduction services.

33973923,2022,Therapy Dose Mediates the Relationship Between Buprenorphine/Naloxone and Opioid Treatment Outcomes in Youth Receiving Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment.,"Evidence-based interventions for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) in youth are limited and little is known about specific and general mechanisms of OUD treatments and how they promote abstinence. The present study used data from the NIDA-CTN-0010 trial to evaluate the mediating effects of psychosocial treatment-related variables (therapy dose and therapeutic alliance) on end-of-treatment opioid abstinence in a sample of youth with OUD (n = 152, 40% female, mean age = 19.7 years) randomized to receive either 12-weeks of treatment with Bup/Nal (""Bup-Nal"") or up to 2 weeks of Bup/Nal detoxification (""Detox"") with both treatment arms receiving weekly individual and group drug counseling ± family therapy. Participants in the Bup-Nal group attended more therapy sessions (16 vs 6 sessions), had increased therapeutic alliance at week-4, and had less opioid use by week-12 compared to those in the Detox group. In both treatment arms, youth who attended more therapy sessions were less likely to have a week-12 opioid positive urine. In a multiple mediator model, therapy dose mediated the association between treatment arm and opioid abstinence. These findings provide preliminary support for a ""dose-response"" effect of addiction-focused therapy on abstinence in youth OUD. Further, the results identified a mediating effect of therapy dose on the relationship between treatment assignment and opioid treatment outcomes, suggesting that extended Bup-Nal treatment may enhance abstinence, in part, through a mechanism of therapy facilitation, by increasing therapy dose during treatment.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Arm;Association;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Counseling;Family Therapy;Female;Humans;Male;Mediating;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Therapeutic Alliance;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Urine;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) designed to promote non-judgmental awareness of present moment experience may be complementary to B/N treatment and offer the potential to enhance retention by reducing substance use and addressing comorbid symptoms. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility and acceptability of the Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC), a trauma-informed, motivationally sensitive, 24-week MBI. Participants (N = 18) were adults with Opioid Use Disorder prescribed B/N. The study team conducted assessments of satisfaction, mindfulness levels, and home practice, as well as qualitative interviews at 4 and 24-weeks. M-ROCC was feasible in a sample with high rates of childhood trauma and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses with 89% of participants retained at 4-weeks and 72% at 24-weeks.

35067397,2022,"""In their mind, they always felt less than"": The role of peers in shifting stigma as a barrier to opioid use disorder treatment retention.","A substantial, national need exists for culturally acceptable, accessible opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is regarded as effective in treating OUD; however, retention in MOUD programs remains low nationally. One known barrier to MOUD retention is stigma, particularly within ethno-racial minority communities. Peer recovery specialists (PRSs), individuals with shared experience in substance use and recovery, may be particularly well suited to support patients in MOUD treatment, and may have capacity to play a key role in decreasing stigma-related barriers to MOUD retention. This study used qualitative methods to solicit feedback on how patients receiving methadone treatment (MT) experience stigma (i.e., toward substance use [SU] and MT). Study staff also gathered information regarding how a PRS role may reduce stigma and improve retention in care, including barriers and facilitators to the PRS role shifting stigma. Study staff conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups (N = 32) with staff and patients receiving MT at an opioid treatment program as well as PRSs in Baltimore. Participants identified experiences of internalized, as well as enacted and anticipated, MT and SU stigma, and described these as barriers to treatment. Participants also identified opportunities for PRSs to shift stigma-related barriers for patients receiving MT through unique aspects of the PRS role, such as their shared lived experience. Reducing stigma surrounding SUD and MT is critical for improving MOUD outcomes, and future research may consider how the PRS role can support this effort.","Analgesics, Opioid;Baltimore;Buprenorphine;Community;Feedback;Focus Groups;Future;Humans;Interview;Methadone;Methods;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Play;Program;Research;Retention in Care;Role;Social Stigma;Specialists;Substance Use;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35333189,2022,Patient- and Provider-Reported Experiences of a Mobile Novel Digital Therapeutic in People With Opioid Use Disorder (reSET-O): Feasibility and Acceptability Study.,"Medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine, are effective and essential for addressing the opioid epidemic. However, high dropout rates from medication remain a challenge. Behavioral treatment with contingency management and cognitive behavioral counseling has shown promise for improving the outcomes of buprenorphine treatment but is complicated to deliver. The delivery of behavioral treatment through technology-based platforms has the potential to make it more feasible for widespread dissemination. reSET-O is a prescription digital therapeutic and a commercial adaptation of the Therapeutic Education System, an internet-based program with a Community Reinforcement Approach to cognitive behavioral therapy. It delivers cognitive behavioral therapy modules and contingency management rewards upon completion of modules and negative urine drug screens. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of reSET-O in a community-based opioid treatment program with a Hub and Spoke model of care as part of a larger strategy to maintain individuals in treatment. Objective and qualitative results, as well as acceptability and likeability of reSET-O, were obtained from 15 individuals. English-speaking individuals aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of current opioid use disorder were recruited after being on buprenorphine for at least 1 week of treatment. Two 12-week prescriptions for reSET-O were written for the 24-week study. Patient reports of drug use and likeability scales of reSET-O were conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 of the study. Qualitative interviews were also conducted. A total of 4 providers were recruited and provided feedback on the acceptability and feasibility of reSET-O. Of the 15 participants who participated in this pilot study, 7 (47%) completed 24 weeks, and 8 (53%) were unable to complete because of dropout after enrollment, attrition in treatment, or incarceration. An average of US $96 in contingency management rewards were earned by participants for the completion of modules for the duration of the pilot study. Participants' subjective feedback revealed that reSET-O was easy to use, enjoyable, and helped provide a safe space to admit recurring substance use. reSET-O was well accepted based on patient and provider feedback in this pilot study; however, adherence and retention in treatment remain areas for improvement. Randomized control trials are needed to assess whether retention of community-based buprenorphine treatment is enhanced through the use of technology-based behavioral interventions such as reSET-O.",Aged;Buprenorphine;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Community;Counseling;Diagnosis;Education;Feedback;Internet;Interview;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Prescriptions;Program;Report;Reward;Scales;Substance Use;Technology;Therapeutics;Urine,Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use,JMIR Form Res,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35611913,2022,The Role of Misinformation and Stigma in Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Uptake.,"Background: Deaths due to opioid overdose continue to rise in the United States. Despite availability of effective treatment for opioid use disorder, uptake is low among those who misuse opioids. Methods: This paper explores the role of misconception, stigma, and misinformation in influencing decisions to initiate medications for opioid use disorder among patients and providers. Conclusion: Misinformation about opioids has been prevalent among future healthcare providers and first responders as well as pharmaceutical companies, which may have implications for treatment. Among individuals with opioid use disorder, treatment uptake and adherence have been negatively affected by misconceptions about treatment efficacy and side effects, as well as stigma. We discuss the role of social media, education, and the community, in mitigating misinformation and addressing misconceptions about opioids and treatment options.","Analgesics, Opioid;Communication;Community;Death;Education;Emergency Responders;Future;Health Personnel;Humans;Methods;Misinformation;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Paper;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Role;Social Media;Social Stigma;Therapeutics;Treatment Efficacy;United States",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Use Misuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35932644,2022,"Peer recovery specialist-delivered, behavioral activation intervention to improve retention in methadone treatment: Results from an open-label, Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot trial.","Despite the efficacy of methadone to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), retention is an urgent priority, particularly among low-income, minoritized populations. Peer recovery specialists are well-positioned to engage vulnerable patients, particularly when trained in an evidence-based intervention to promote retention. This hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot trial aimed to demonstrate the proof of concept of a peer recovery specialist-delivered behavioral activation and problem solving-based approach (Peer Activate) to improve methadone retention. Implementation outcomes included feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity. Feasibility and acceptability were defined by the percentage of participants who initiated the intervention (≥75%) and completed ≥75% of core sessions, respectively. Fidelity was assessed via independent rating of a randomly selected 20% of sessions. The primary effectiveness outcome was methadone retention at three-months post-intervention vs. a comparison cohort initiating methadone during the same time period. Secondary outcomes included methadone adherence, substance use frequency, and substance use-related problems. Benchmarks for feasibility and acceptability were surpassed: 86.5% (32/37) initiated the intervention, and 81.3% of participants who initiated attended ≥75% of core sessions. The mean independent rater fidelity score was 87.9%, indicating high peer fidelity. For effectiveness outcomes, 88.6% of participants in Peer Activate were retained in methadone treatment at three-months post-intervention-28.9% higher than individuals initiating methadone treatment alone in the same time period [χ2(1) = 10.10, p = 0.001]. Among Peer Activate participants, urine-verified methadone adherence reached 97% at post-intervention, and there was a significant reduction in substance use frequency from 48% of past two-week days used at baseline to 31.9% at post-intervention [t(25) = 1.82, p = .041]. Among participants who completed the core Peer Activate sessions (n = 26), there was a significant reduction in substance use-related problems [t(21) = 1.84, p = 0.040]. Given the rapid scale-up of peer recovery specialist programs nationwide and the urgent need to promote methadone retention, these results, although preliminary, have important potential clinical significance. The next steps are to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized trial with a larger sample size and longer-term follow-up to further establish the implementation and effectiveness of the Peer Activate approach.",Behavior Therapy;Benchmarks;Health;Humans;Hybrids;Income;Methadone;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Population;Poverty;Problem Solving;Program;Sample Size;Scales;Specialists;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time;Urine,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36470641,2022,"Effects of a trauma-informed mindful recovery program on comorbid pain, anxiety, and substance use during primary care buprenorphine treatment: A proof-of-concept study.","A mindfulness-based intervention that reduces comorbid pain, anxiety, and substance use during office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) could enhance retention and prevent overdose. We conducted a pilot study of the Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC), a 24-week trauma-informed program with a motivationally-sensitive curriculum. Patients prescribed buprenorphine (N = 18) enrolled in M-ROCC. We collected urine toxicology biweekly. At 0, 4, and 24 weeks, participants completed PROMIS-Pain, PROMIS-Anxiety, Mindfulness (FFMQ), Experiential Avoidance (BEAQ), Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Self-Compassion (SCS-SF) scales. We estimated changes over time using mixed models. Participants completed qualitative interviews at 4 and 24 weeks. Positive urine toxicology decreased over time for cocaine (β = -.266, p = .008) and benzodiazepines (β = -.208, p = .028). M-ROCC reduced PROMIS-Pain (Z = -2.29; p = .022), BEAQ (Z = -2.83; p = .0005), and increased FFMQ (Z = 3.51; p &lt; .001), MAIA (Z = 3.40; p = .001), and SCS-SF (Z = 2.29; p = .022). Participants with co-morbid anxiety had decreased PROMIS-Anxiety (Z = -2.53; p = .012). Interviewed participants commonly used mindfulness practices for stress and anxiety (12/12, 100%), and to reduce pain catastrophizing and rumination (7/12, 58%). This is the first study to report the effects of a 24-week mindfulness program during buprenorphine treatment on common comorbidities, including pain interference, anxiety, cocaine, and benzodiazepine use. The findings that M-ROCC is associated with reduced experiential avoidance, as well as increased interoceptive awareness and self-compassion, align with proposed mechanisms that are now extended to OUD treatment. Future larger randomized controlled trials are needed before effectiveness can be established and the role of these mechanisms can be confirmed.",Anxiety;Awareness;Benzodiazepines;Buprenorphine;Cocaine;Comorbidity;Compassion;Continuity of Patient Care;Curriculum;Future;Interview;Mindfulness;Opioids;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Patients;Pilot Projects;Primary Health Care;Program;Proof of Concept Study;Randomized Controlled Trial;Report;Role;Scales;Self;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Urine;Wounds and Injuries,Pain;Substance Use;Wounds and Injuries,Am J Addict,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36531337,2020,Feasibility of a Citizen-driven Hackathon to Increase Public Engagement and Solutions to Address the Opioid Crisis.,"Interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address complex societal problems, such as the opioid crisis. We sought to explore the feasibility and potential issues encountered in planning and implementing a 24-hour hackathon competition to bring together teams from law enforcement, public health, and data science to develop solutions to the opioid epidemic. We enlisted an advisory board and planning committee, including key stakeholders (e.g., high-level representatives from government agencies) to plan the event. Teams completed an online registration form with questions about team composition. Each team captain completed a survey at the event describing prior experiences with their team, knowledge and interest around the opioid epidemic, and hackathon expectations. Twenty-nine teams (108 individuals) registered. 76% had a technical/engineering background. Participants were from industry (55%), academia (30%), public health/medicine (9%), and government/public policy (6%). Nineteen teams attended the event. Team captains were primarily 18-29 years of age, had moderate experience and interest in the opioid crisis, and had never attended an opioid-related event. It is feasible to implement a 24-hour opioid-focused hackathon and recruit teams/participants from a broad range of disciplines.

32663518,2020,Visualization of microneuromas by using in vivo confocal microscopy: An objective biomarker for the diagnosis of neuropathic corneal pain?,"The diagnosis of neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is challenging, as it is often difficult to differentiate it from conventional dry eye disease (DED). In addition to eye pain, NCP can present with similar signs and symptoms of DED. The purpose of this study is to find an objective diagnostic sign to identify patients with NCP, using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). This was a comparative, retrospective, case-control study. Patients with clinical diagnosis of NCP (n = 25), DED (n = 30), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 16), who underwent corneal imaging with IVCM (HRT3/RCM) were included. Central corneal IVCM scans were analyzed by 2 masked observers for nerve density and number, presence of microneuromas (terminal enlargements of subbasal corneal nerve) and/or nerve beading (bead-like formation along the nerves), and dendritiform cell (DC) density. There was a decrease in total nerve density in both NCP (14.14 ± 1.03 mm/mm2) and DED patients (12.86 ± 1.04 mm/mm2), as compared to normal controls (23.90 ± 0.92 mm/mm2; p &lt; 0.001). However, total nerve density was not statistically different between NCP and DED patients (p = 0.63). Presence of nerve beading was not significantly different between patients and normal controls (p = 0.15). Interestingly, microneuromas were observed in all patients with NCP, while they were not present in any of the patients with conventional DED (sensitivity and specificity of 100%). DC density was significantly increased in both NCP (71.89 ± 16.91 cells/mm2) and DED patients (111.5 ± 23.86 cells/mm2), as compared to normal controls (24.81 ± 4.48 cells/mm2 (p &lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in DC density between DED and NCP patients (p = 0.31). IVCM may be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of NCP in the presence of neuropathic symptoms. Microneuromas may serve as a sensitive and specific biomarker for the diagnosis of NCP.","Adult;Biomarkers;Case-Control Studies;Cells;Cornea;Diagnosis;Dry Eye Syndromes;Eye Pain;Female;Humans;Lasers;Male;Microscopy, Confocal;Middle Aged;Pain;Patients;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sex;Signs and Symptoms",Dry Eye Syndromes;Eye Pain;Pain,Ocul Surf,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32707336,2020,Comparison of clinical characteristics of post-refractive surgery-related and post-herpetic neuropathic corneal pain.,"To compare the clinical characteristics and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) findings of patients with neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) due to refractive surgery (RS-NCP) and herpetic eye disease (H-NCP) to controls. Sixteen patients with RS-NCP and 7 patients with H-NCP, and 37 healthy reference age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included to the study. The medical records were reviewed for demographic features, detailed disease history, ocular surface disease index (OSDI), ocular pain assessment survey (OPAS) scores. IVCM images of patients were analyzed and compared to reference controls by two masked observers. The mean pain intensity score for the last 24 h (5.1 ± 2.4 vs. 3.9 ± 1.2; p = 0.27), last 2 weeks (6.1 ± 2.5 vs. 4.8 ± 2.3; p = 0.13) for RS-NCP vs. H-NCP respectively, and quality of life scores (p = 0.23) were similar in both groups. Quality of life, especially mood (p = 0.06) and enjoying life/relations to others (p = 0.10) were affected in both groups, but were not statistically significant between groups. The mean total nerve density was lower in RS-NCP (5,702.4 ± 4,599.0 μm/mm2) compared to their respective controls (26,422.8 ± 4,491.0; p &lt; 0.001) and in the H-NCP group (2,149.5 ± 2,985.9) compared to their respective controls (22,948.8 ± 3,169.0; p &lt; 0.001). Alterations in DC density were similar between all groups (38.3 ± 48.0 cells/mm2 in RS-NCP, 61.0 ± 76.9 in H-NCP, p = 0.95).

32719355,2020,Preferential inhibition of adaptive immune system dynamics by glucocorticoids in patients after acute surgical trauma.,"Glucocorticoids (GC) are a controversial yet commonly used intervention in the clinical management of acute inflammatory conditions, including sepsis or traumatic injury. In the context of major trauma such as surgery, concerns have been raised regarding adverse effects from GC, thereby necessitating a better understanding of how GCs modulate the immune response. Here we report the results of a randomized controlled trial (NCT02542592) in which we employ a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach to characterize innate and adaptive cell signaling dynamics after a major surgery (primary outcome) in patients treated with placebo or methylprednisolone (MP). A robust, unsupervised bootstrap clustering of immune cell subsets coupled with random forest analysis shows profound (AUC = 0.92, p-value = 3.16E-8) MP-induced alterations of immune cell signaling trajectories, particularly in the adaptive compartments. By contrast, key innate signaling responses previously associated with pain and functional recovery after surgery, including STAT3 and CREB phosphorylation, are not affected by MP. These results imply cell-specific and pathway-specific effects of GCs, and also prompt future studies to examine GCs' effects on clinical outcomes likely dependent on functional adaptive immune responses.","Acute Disease;Adaptive Immune Response;Adaptive Immunity;Aged;Area Under Curve;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Case-Control Studies;Cells;Cluster Analysis;Comprehension;Double-Blind Method;Fatigue;Female;Forests;Future;General Surgery;Glucocorticoids;Humans;Immune System;Immunity;Injuries;Male;Methylprednisolone;NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha;Pain;Patients;Phenotype;Phosphorylation;Placebos;Randomized Controlled Trial;Report;STAT3 Transcription Factor;Sepsis;Signal Transduction;Treatment Outcome;Wounds and Injuries",Acute Disease;Fatigue;Injuries;Pain;Sepsis;Wounds and Injuries,Nat Commun,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32766469,2020,A novel cortical biomarker signature for predicting pain sensitivity: protocol for the PREDICT longitudinal analytical validation study.,"Temporomandibular disorder is a common musculoskeletal pain condition with development of chronic symptoms in 49% of patients. Although a number of biological factors have shown an association with chronic temporomandibular disorder in cross-sectional and case control studies, there are currently no biomarkers that can predict the development of chronic symptoms. The PREDICT study aims to undertake analytical validation of a novel peak alpha frequency (PAF) and corticomotor excitability (CME) biomarker signature using a human model of the transition to sustained myofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor [NGF]). This article describes, a priori, the methods and analysis plan. This study uses a multisite longitudinal, experimental study to follow individuals for a period of 30 days as they progressively develop and experience complete resolution of NGF-induced muscle pain. One hundred fifty healthy participants will be recruited. Participants will complete twice daily electronic pain diaries from day 0 to day 30 and undergo assessment of pressure pain thresholds, and recording of PAF and CME on days 0, 2, and 5. Intramuscular injection of NGF will be given into the right masseter muscle on days 0 and 2. The primary outcome is pain sensitivity. PREDICT is the first study to undertake analytical validation of a PAF and CME biomarker signature. The study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the biomarker signature to predict an individual's sensitivity to pain.

32860971,2020,Efficacy and tolerability of nortriptyline in the management of neuropathic corneal pain.,"Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is a recently acknowledged disease entity. However, there is no consensus in potential treatment strategies, particularly in patients with a centralized component of pain. This study aims to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline, among NCP patients. Patients with clinically diagnosed NCP and a centralized component of pain, treated with oral nortriptyline, who had recorded pain scores as assessed by the ocular pain assessment survey at the first and last visit were included. Patients were excluded if they had any other ocular pathology that might result in pain or had less than 4 weeks of nortriptyline use. Demographics, time between visits, concomitant medications, systemic and ocular co-morbidities, duration of NCP, side effects, ocular pain scores, and quality of life (QoL) assessment were recorded. Thirty patients with a mean age of 53.1 ± 18.5 were included. Male to female ratio was 8:22. Mean ocular pain in the past 24 h improved from 5.7 ± 2.1 to 3.6 ± 2.1 after 10.5 ± 9.1 months (p &lt; 0.0001). Twelve patients (40.0%) had equal to or more than 50% improvement, 6 patients (20.0%) had 30-49% improvement, 6 patients (20.0%) had 1-29% improvement, 4 patients (13.3%) did not improve, while 2 patients (6.7%) reported increase in pain levels. Mean QoL improved from 6.0 ± 2.5 to 4.3 ± 2.4 (p = 0.019). Eight patients (26.6%) discontinued treatment due to persistent side effects, despite improvement by 22.4%. Nortriptyline was effective in relieving NCP symptoms in patients with centralized component and insufficient response to other systemic and topical therapies who tolerated the drug for at least 4 weeks. Nortriptyline may be used in the management of patients with NCP.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic;Consensus;Demography;Disease;Dry Eye Syndromes;Eye Pain;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Neuralgia;Nortriptyline;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Quality of Life;Surveys;Therapeutics;Time;Young Adult",Dry Eye Syndromes;Eye Pain;Neuralgia;Pain,Ocul Surf,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
33450415,2021,Low-dose naltrexone is effective and well-tolerated for modulating symptoms in patients with neuropathic corneal pain.,"Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is caused by damage or disease of the somatosensory nervous system that innervates the cornea and presents with symptoms of pain or persistent unpleasant sensations, such as burning, dryness, or light sensitivity. This retrospective study aims to assess the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in refractory NCP patients. Fifty-nine NCP patients with a centralized component treated with oral LDN 4.5  mg at bedtime for at least four weeks were identified. Thirty out of 59 patients who had a baseline pain score ≥4 on the visual analogue scale had completed the ocular pain assessment survey (OPAS) and presented persistent pain, despite instillation of topical anesthetic drops, were included. Changes in pain scores, comorbidities, side effects, among others, were analyzed. Change in ocular pain scores (scale 0-10) and quality of life (QoL) scores (scale 0-100%) were the main endpoints. Mean age (years ± SD) was 45.60 ± 19.30 with a white (80.00%) female (73.33%) predominance. Duration of LDN use was 14.87 ± 11.25 months, and the duration of NCP before treatment was 17.53 ± 17.29 months. Eight patients used LDN as a monotherapy, whereas the remaining used it as an adjunct therapy. LDN resulted in a 49.22% decrease in mean pain score from 6.13 ± 1.93 to 3.23 ± 2.60 (p &lt; 0.001). Mean QoL scores by the OPAS were 5.84 ± 2.57 at the first visit and improved to 3.77 ± 2.91 at the last visit (p = 0.023). Common side effects were vivid dreams, headaches, and stomachache.

Retrospective Case series of 7 stage 1 NK patients who presented with concurrent ocular pain, as confirmed by clinical examination, proparacaine challenge test, and in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM). Records were assessed for results of ocular surface disease index (OSDI), pain on visual analog scale (VAS), ocular pain assessment survey (OPAS), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score, and IVCM findings. IVCM findings were compared to that of 20 healthy reference controls. Mean age of patients was 63.7 ± 11.6 (range 44-76) years and 56.9 ± 8.6 (range 42-74) years in reference controls (p = 0.11). At presentation, ocular discomfort was 8.0 ± 1.3 (range 7-10) on VAS and mean OSDI scores were 72.26 ± 6.81 (range 62.50-79.54). Mean BCVA was 20/40, and mean CFS scores were 3.43 ± 0.79 (range 2-4) on the Oxford scale. IVCM analysis showed significant decrease in mean total, main and branch nerve densities in ranges consistent with NK as compared to normal controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all), increased dendritiform cell density in three patients (p &lt; 0.001), and the presence of microneuromas in six of the patients. Patients with NK are thought to present with hypoesthesia. However, nerve damage and inflammation, which play a role in the development of NK may result in the development of chronic ocular pain, such as NCP, resulting in potential underdiagnosis of either disease.","Adult;Aged;Cell Density;Cornea;Disease;Eye Pain;Fluoresceins;Humans;Hypesthesia;Index;Inflammation;Microscopy, Confocal;Middle Aged;Neuralgia;Neuroma;Pain;Pain Measurement;Patients;Play;Records;Retrospective Studies;Role;Scales;Staining;Surveys;Thought;Trigeminal Nerve Diseases;Visual Acuity;Visual Analog Scale",Eye Pain;Hypesthesia;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Neuroma;Pain;Trigeminal Nerve Diseases,Ocul Surf,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

Rather than assessing symptoms as manifestations of illness, we used them to develop a chronic pain classification system. A cohort of real-world treatment-seeking patients completed a multidimensional patient-reported registry as part of a routine initial evaluation in a multidisciplinary academic pain clinic. We applied hierarchical clustering on a training subset of 11,448 patients using nine pain-agnostic symptoms. We then validated a three-cluster solution reflecting a graded scale of severity across all symptoms and eight independent pain-specific measures in additional subsets of 3817 and 1273 patients. Negative affect–related factors were key determinants of cluster assignment. The smallest subset included follow-up assessments that were predicted by baseline cluster assignment. Findings provide a cost-effective classification system that promises to improve clinical care and alleviate suffering by providing putative markers for personalized diagnosis and prognosis.",Affect;Chronic Pain;Classification;Cluster Analysis;Cost;Diagnosis;Form;Measures;Pain;Pain Clinics;Patients;Prognosis;Registries;Scales;Solutions;Symptom Assessment;Therapeutics,Chronic Pain;Pain,Sci Adv,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34716408,2022,Effects of placebo administration on immune mechanisms and relationships with central endogenous opioid neurotransmission.,"Behavioral conditioning and expectation can have profound impact on animal and human physiology. Placebo, administered under positive expectation in clinical trials, can have potent effects on disease pathology, obscuring active medications. Emerging evidence suggests placebo-responsive neurotransmitter systems (e.g., endogenous opioid) regulate immune function by manipulating inflammatory proteins including IL-18, a potent pro-inflammatory, nociceptive cytokine implicated in pathophysiology of various diseases. Validation that neuroimmune interactions involving brain μ-opioid receptor (MOR) activity and plasma IL-18 underlie placebo analgesic expectation could have widespread clinical applications. Unfortunately, current lack of mechanistic clarity obfuscates clinical translation. To elucidate neuroimmune interactions underlying placebo analgesia, we exposed 37 healthy human volunteers to a standardized pain challenge on each of 2 days within a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) neuroimaging paradigm using the MOR selective radiotracer, 11C-Carfentanil (CFN). Each day volunteers received an intervention (placebo under analgesic expectation or no treatment), completed PET scanning, and rated their pain experience. MOR BPND parametric maps were generated from PET scans using standard methods. Results showed placebo reduced plasma IL-18 during pain (W74 = -3.7, p &lt; 0.001), the extent correlating with reduction in pain scores.

35676017,2022,Signature for Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT): protocol for a multisite prospective signature study in chronic musculoskeletal pain.,"Current treatments for chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain are suboptimal. Discovery of robust prognostic markers separating patients who recover from patients with persistent pain and disability is critical for developing patient-specific treatment strategies and conceiving novel approaches that benefit all patients. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, this study aims to discover and validate a robust prognostic signature that measures across multiple dimensions in the same adolescent patient cohort with a computational analysis pipeline. This will facilitate risk stratification in adolescent patients with chronic MSK pain and more resourceful allocation of patients to costly and potentially burdensome multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches. Here we describe a multi-institutional effort to collect, curate and analyse a high dimensional data set including epidemiological, psychometric, quantitative sensory, brain imaging and biological information collected over the course of 12 months. The aim of this effort is to derive a multivariate model with strong prognostic power regarding the clinical course of adolescent MSK pain and function. The study complies with the National Institutes of Health policy on the use of a single internal review board (sIRB) for multisite research, with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Review Board as the reviewing IRB. Stanford's IRB is a relying IRB within the sIRB. As foreign institutions, the University of Toronto and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) are overseen by their respective ethics boards. All participants provide signed informed consent. We are committed to open-access publication, so that patients, clinicians and scientists have access to the study data and the signature(s) derived. After findings are published, we will upload a limited data set for sharing with other investigators on applicable repositories.

36495945,2023,The reliability of two prospective cortical biomarkers for pain: EEG peak alpha frequency and TMS corticomotor excitability.,"Many pain biomarkers fail to move from discovery to clinical application, attributed to poor reliability and an inability to accurately classify at-risk individuals. Preliminary evidence has shown that high pain sensitivity is associated with slow peak alpha frequency (PAF), and depression of corticomotor excitability (CME), potentially due to impairments in ascending sensory and descending motor pathway signalling respectively NEW METHOD: The present study evaluated the reliability of PAF and CME responses during sustained pain. Specifically, we determined whether, over several days of pain, a) PAF remains stable and b) individuals show two stable and distinct CME responses: facilitation and depression. Participants were given an injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the right masseter muscle on Day 0 and Day 2, inducing sustained pain. Electroencephalography (EEG) to assess PAF and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess CME were recorded on Day 0, Day 2 and Day 5. Using a weighted peak estimate, PAF reliability (n = 75) was in the excellent range even without standard pre-processing and ∼2 min recording length. Using a single peak estimate, PAF reliability was in the moderate-good range. For CME (n = 74), 80% of participants showed facilitation or depression of CME beyond an optimal cut-off point, with the stability of these changes in the good range. No study has assessed the reliability of PAF or feasibility of classifying individuals as facilitators/depressors, in response to sustained pain. PAF was reliable even in the presence of pain. The use of a weighted peak estimate for PAF is recommended, as excellent test-retest reliability can be obtained even when using minimal pre-processing and ∼2 min recording. We also showed that 80% of individuals exhibit either facilitation or depression of CME, with these changes being stable across sessions. Our study provides support for the reliability of PAF and CME as prospective cortical biomarkers. As such, our paper adds important methodological advances to the rapidly growing field of pain biomarkers.","Biomarkers;Depression;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Motor;Exhibition;Humans;Injections;Jaw;Masseter Muscle;Methods;Motor Pathways;Musculoskeletal Pain;Nerve Growth Factor;Nerve Growth Factors;News;Pain;Paper;Prospective Studies;Reproducibility of Results;Risk;Sensitivity;Standards;Test-Retest Reliability;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",Musculoskeletal Pain;Pain,J Neurosci Methods,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36651586,2023,Developing multivariable models for predicting headache improvement in patients with acute post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury: A preliminary study.,"Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a common symptom after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Although there have been several studies that have used clinical features of PTH to attempt to predict headache recovery, currently no accurate methods exist for predicting individuals' improvement from acute PTH. This study investigated the utility of clinical questionnaires for predicting (i) headache improvement at 3 and 6 months, and (ii) headache trajectories over the first 3 months. We conducted a clinic-based observational longitudinal study of patients with acute PTH who completed a battery of clinical questionnaires within 0-59 days post-mTBI. The battery included headache history, symptom evaluation, cognitive tests, psychological tests, and scales assessing photosensitivity, hyperacusis, insomnia, cutaneous allodynia, and substance use. Each participant completed a web-based headache diary, which was used to determine headache improvement. null Questionnaires completed following mTBI have good utility for predicting headache improvement at 3 and 6 months in the future as well as the evolving headache trajectory. Reducing the battery to only three questionnaires, which assess post-concussive symptom load and biopsychosocialecologic factors, was helpful to determine a reasonable prediction accuracy for headache improvement.","Allodynia;Cognitive Testing;Concussion, Mild;Diary;Future;Headache;History;Hyperacusis;Longitudinal Studies;Methods;Patients;Post-Concussion Syndrome;Post-Traumatic Headache;Psychological Tests;Questionnaires;Scales;Sleeplessness;Substance Use;Symptom Evaluation","Allodynia;Concussion, Mild;Headache;Hyperacusis;Post-Concussion Syndrome;Post-Traumatic Headache;Sleeplessness;Substance Use",Headache,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

Here, we examined the isolated enzymatic A1 domain of LT (LTA1) for intranasal safety and efficacy in combination with influenza (flu) vaccination. LTA1-treated mice exhibited no neurotoxicity, as measured by olfactory system testing and H&amp;E staining of nasal tissue in contrast with cholera toxin. In vaccination studies, intranasal LTA1 enhanced immune responses to inactivated virus antigen and subsequent protection against H1N1 flu challenge in mice (8-week or 24-months). In addition, lung H1N1 viral titers post-challenge correlated to serum antibody responses; however, enhanced protection was also observed in μMT mice lacking B-cells while activation and recruitment of CD4 T-cells into the lung was apparent. Thus, we report that LTA1 protein is a novel, safe and effective enterotoxin adjuvant that improves protection of an intranasal flu vaccination by a mechanism that does not appear to require B-cells.","Adjuvants, Immunologic;Administration, Intranasal;Aging;Animals;Antibodies;Antibody Formation;Antigens;B-Lymphocytes;CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cholera Toxin;Clinical Trial;Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic;Enterotoxins;Female;Heat;Immunity;Immunity, Mucosal;Immunization;Inflammation;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype;Influenza, Human;Lung;Lymphocyte Activation;Lymphocyte Depletion;Mast Cells;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Orthomyxoviridae Infections;Proteins;Report;Safety;Serum;Staining;T-Lymphocytes;Tissues;Vaccination;Vaccines;Viruses","Cholera;Inflammation;Influenza, Human;Orthomyxoviridae Infections",Sci Rep,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32787282,2020,Novel Vaccine That Blunts Fentanyl Effects and Sequesters Ultrapotent Fentanyl Analogues.,"Active immunization is an emerging potential modality to combat fatal overdose amid the opioid epidemic. In this study, we described the design, synthesis, formulation, and animal testing of an efficacious vaccine against fentanyl. The vaccine formulation is composed of a novel fentanyl hapten conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) and adjuvanted with liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide. The linker and hapten N-phenyl-N-(1-(4-(3-(tritylthio)propanamido)phenethyl)piperidin-4-yl)propionamide were conjugated sequentially to TT using amine-N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester and thiol-maleimide reaction chemistries, respectively. Conjugation was facile, efficient, and reproducible with a protein recovery of &gt;98% and a hapten density of 30-35 per carrier protein molecule. In mice, immunization induced high and robust antibody endpoint titers in the order of &gt;106 against the hapten. The antisera bound fentanyl, carfentanil, cyclopropyl fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl, and furanyl fentanyl in vitro with antibody-drug dissociation constants in the range of 0.36-4.66 nM. No cross-reactivity to naloxone, naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine was observed. In vivo, immunization shifted the antinociceptive dose-response curve of fentanyl to higher doses. Collectively, these preclinical results showcased the desired traits of a potential vaccine against fentanyl and demonstrated the feasibility of immunization to combat fentanyl-induced effects.","Aluminum Hydroxide;Amines;Analgesics;Animals;Antibodies;Buprenorphine;Carrier Proteins;Chemistry;Dissociation;Drug Overdose;Esters;Female;Fentanyl;Haptens;Immune Sera;Immunization;Immunization, Active;In Vitro;Lipid A;Liposomes;Maleimides;Methadone;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Proteins;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Tetanus Toxoid;Vaccines;Vaccines, Conjugate",Dissociation;Drug Overdose;Tetanus,Mol Pharm,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32876947,2020,Synthesis of a deuterated 6-AmHap internal standard for the determination of hapten density in a heroin vaccine drug product.,"A deuterated hapten was designed and synthesized that will be essential for a future study of residual hapten and stability of a hapten-protein conjugate. This hapten, 6-AmHap, was chosen for a heroin vaccine that is now slated for a Phase 1 clinical trial. A maleimide-thiol bioconjugation strategy was successfully applied to our heroin vaccine to connect the hapten 6-AmHap with an immunogenic carrier protein (tetanus toxoid, TT) through a trityl-protected 3-mercaptopropanamide linker. The antibodies induced by the vaccine have been found to have activity against several opioids, including heroin and its metabolites, and, importantly, leave alternate pain treatment medications such as methadone untouched. To the best of our knowledge, no other hapten for a heroin vaccine has been deuterated, yet this tool may prove to be of great importance in the study of residual hapten during product release and the long-term stability program of a hapten-protein conjugate as part of FDA regulatory requirements. Hydrocodone was the starting material for the synthesis of the deuterated 6-AmHap, with a stable amide at C6 and a 3-mercaptopropanamide linker attached at C3. The desired deuterated product was prepared as the disulfide, 3,3'-disulfanediylbis(N-((7S,7aR,12bS)-7-acetamido-3-[2 H3 ]methyl)-2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a-octahydro-1H-4,12-methanobenzofuro[3,2-e]isoquinolin-9-yl)propanamide), that could be easily reduced to form the needed hapten, N-((4aR,7S,7aR,12bS)-7-acetamido-3-[2 H3 ]methyl]-2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a-octahydro-1H-4,12-methanobenzofuro[3,2-e]isoquinolin-9-yl)-3-mercaptopropanamide.","Amides;Antibodies;Carrier Proteins;Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic;Deuterium;Disulfides;Form;Future;Haptens;Heroin;Hydrocodone;Knowledge;Maleimides;Methadone;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Proteins;Reference Standards;Standards;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Tetanus Toxoid;Therapeutics;Vaccines",Pain;Tetanus,J Labelled Comp Radiopharm,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33986280,2021,Fentanyl conjugate vaccine by injected or mucosal delivery with dmLT or LTA1 adjuvants implicates IgA in protection from drug challenge.,"Fentanyl is a major contributor to the devastating increase in overdose deaths from substance use disorders (SUD). A vaccine targeting fentanyl could be a powerful immunotherapeutic. Here, we evaluated adjuvant and delivery strategies for conjugate antigen vaccination with fentanyl-based haptens. We tested adjuvants derived from the heat-labile toxin of E. coli including dmLT and LTA1 by intramuscular, sublingual or intranasal delivery. Our results show anti-fentanyl serum antibodies and antibody secreting cells in the bone-marrow after vaccination with highest levels observed with an adjuvant (alum, dmLT, or LTA1). Vaccine adjuvanted with LTA1 or dmLT elicited the highest levels of anti-fentanyl antibodies, whereas alum achieved highest levels against the carrier protein. Vaccination with sublingual dmLT or intranasal LTA1 provided the most robust blockade of fentanyl-induced analgesia and CNS penetration correlating strongly to anti-FEN IgA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates dmLT or LTA1 adjuvant as well as mucosal delivery may be attractive strategies for improving the efficacy of vaccines against SUD.","Analgesia;Antibodies;Antibody-Secreting Cells;Antigens;Bone Marrow;Carrier Proteins;Death;Escherichia coli;Fentanyl;Haptens;Heat;Immunoglobulin A;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Serum;Substance Use Disorders;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vaccines, Conjugate",Death;Substance Use Disorders,NPJ Vaccines,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34179783,2021,"Synthesis and immunological effects of C14-linked 4,5-epoxymorphinan analogues as novel heroin vaccine haptens.","Active immunization is being explored as a potential therapeutic to combat accidental overdose and to mitigate the abuse potential of opioids. Hapten design is one of the crucial factors that determines the efficacy of a candidate vaccine to substance abuse and remains one of the most active areas of research in vaccine development. Herein we report for the first time the synthesis of three novel opiate surrogates with the linker attachment site at C14, 1 (6,14-AmidoHap), 2 (14-AmidoMorHap), and 3 (14-AmidoHerHap) as novel heroin haptens. The compounds 1, 2, and 3 are analogues with different substituents at C6: an acetamide, a hydroxyl moiety, and an acetate, respectively. All three haptens had a phenolic hydroxyl group at C3. The haptens were conjugated to the tetanus toxoid carrier protein, adjuvanted with liposomal monophosphoryl lipid A/aluminum hydroxide and were tested in mice in terms of immunogenicity and efficacy. Immunization of mice resulted in antibody endpoint titers of &gt;105 against all the haptens. Neither of the conjugates of 1, 2, and 3 had induced antibodies with selectivity broad enough to recognize and bind heroin, 6-AM, and morphine resulting in little to no protection against the antinociceptive effects of heroin in vivo. Only the mice immunized with conjugate 3 were partially protected against heroin-induced antinociception. These results contribute to the growing body of knowledge that the linker position and the subtle structural differences in the hapten scaffold impact the selectivity of the induced antibodies. Together, these highlight the importance of rational hapten design for heroin vaccine development.","Acetamides;Acetates;Aluminum Hydroxide;Antibodies;Carrier Proteins;Haptens;Heroin;Immunization;Immunization, Active;Knowledge;Lipid A;Mice;Morphine;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Report;Research;Substance Abuse;Tetanus Toxoid;Therapeutics;Time;Vaccines",Substance Abuse;Tetanus,RSC Chem Biol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34205869,2021,Effect of Preexisting Immunity to Tetanus Toxoid on the Efficacy of Tetanus Toxoid-Conjugated Heroin Vaccine in Mice.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a serious health problem that has dramatically increased over the last decade. Although current therapies for the management of OUD can be effective, they have limitations. The complementary strategy to combat the opioid crisis is the development of a conjugate vaccine to generate high affinity antibodies in order to neutralize opioids in circulation before reaching the brain. The components of an opioid vaccine include an opioid hapten (6-AmHap) that is conjugated to a carrier protein (tetanus toxoid) with the addition of adjuvants (Army Liposome Formulation adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide-ALFA). There is no consensus in the literature as to whether preexisting immunity to the carrier protein may impact the immunogenicity of the conjugate vaccine by inducing an enhanced or suppressed immune response to the hapten. Here, we investigated whether pre-exposure to tetanus toxoid would affect the immunogenicity and efficacy of the heroin vaccine, TT-6-AmHap. Mice were primed with diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at weeks -4 and -2, then immunized with TT-6-AmHap vaccine at weeks 0, 3, and 6. Using ELISA and behavioral assays, we found that preexisting immunity to tetanus toxoid had no influence on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the TT-6-AmHap vaccine.","Affect;Aluminum Hydroxide;Antibody Affinity;Brain;Carrier Proteins;Consensus;Diphtheria;Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Haptens;Health;Heroin;Immunity;Liposomes;Literature;Mice;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Tetanus;Tetanus Toxoid;Therapeutics;Vaccines;Vaccines, Conjugate;Whooping Cough",Diphtheria;Opioid Use Disorder;Tetanus;Whooping Cough,Vaccines (Basel),Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34693882,2021,Novel chimeric monoclonal antibodies that block fentanyl effects and alter fentanyl biodistribution in mice.,"The prevalence and societal impact of opioid use disorder (OUD) is an acknowledged public health crisis that is further aggravated by the current pandemic. One of the devastating consequences of OUD is opioid overdose deaths. While multiple medications are now available to treat OUD, given the prevalence and societal burden, additional well-tolerated and effective therapies are still needed. To this point, we have developed chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that will specifically complex with fentanyl and its analogs in the periphery, thereby preventing them from reaching the central nervous system. Additionally, mAb-based passive immunotherapy offers a high degree of specificity to drugs of abuse and does not interfere with an individual's ability to use any of the medications used to treat OUD. We hypothesized that sequestering fentanyl and its analogs in the periphery will mitigate their negative effects on the brain and peripheral organs. This study is the first report of chimeric mAb against fentanyl and its analogs. We have discovered, engineered the chimeric versions, and identified the selectivity of these antibodies, through in vitro characterization and in vivo animal challenge studies. Two mAb candidates with very high (0.1-1.3 nM) binding affinities to fentanyl and its analogs were found to be effective in engaging fentanyl in the periphery and blocking its effects in challenged animals. Results presented in this work constitute a major contribution in the field of novel therapeutics targeting OUD.","Ability;Animals;Antibodies;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological;Brain;Central Nervous System;Death;Fentanyl;Immunization, Passive;Immunotherapy, Passive;In Vitro;Mice;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Public Health;Report;Specificity;Therapeutics;Tissue Distribution;Work",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,MAbs,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

This is the first report of hydrolytically stable haptenic surrogates of heroin with the attachment site at the C1 position in the 4,5-epoxymorophinan nucleus. We prepared respective tetanus toxoid (TT)-hapten conjugates as heroin vaccine immunogens and evaluated their efficacy in vivo. We showed that all TT-hapten conjugates induced high antibody endpoint titers against the targets but only haptens 2 and 3 can induce protective effects against heroin in vivo. The epimeric analogues of these haptens, 1 and 4, failed to protect mice from the effects of heroin. We also showed that the in vivo efficacy is consistent with the results of the in vitro drug sequestration assay. Attachment of the linker at the C1 position induced antibodies with weak binding to the target drugs. Only TT-2 and TT-3 yielded antibodies that bound heroin and 6-acetyl morphine. None of the TT-hapten conjugates induced antibodies that cross-reacted with morphine, methadone, naloxone, or naltrexone, and only TT-3 interacted weakly with buprenorphine, and that subtle structural difference, especially at the C6 position, can vastly alter the specificity of the induced antibodies. This study is an important contribution in the field of vaccine development against small-molecule targets, providing proof that the chirality at C6 in these epoxymorphinans is a vital key to their effectiveness.",Antibodies;Buprenorphine;Haptens;Heroin;In Vitro;Methadone;Mice;Morphine;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Report;Specificity;Tetanus Toxoid;Therapeutics;Vaccines,Opioid Use Disorder;Tetanus,Molecules,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
28534262,2018,Inflammatory Changes in Paravertebral Sympathetic Ganglia in Two Rat Pain Models.,"Injury to peripheral nerves can lead to neuropathic pain, along with well-studied effects on sensory neurons, including hyperexcitability, abnormal spontaneous activity, and neuroinflammation in the sensory ganglia. Neuropathic pain can be enhanced by sympathetic activity. Peripheral nerve injury may also damage sympathetic axons or expose them to an inflammatory environment. In this study, we examined the lumbar sympathetic ganglion responses to two rat pain models: ligation of the L5 spinal nerve, and local inflammation of the L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which does not involve axotomy. Both models resulted in neuroinflammatory changes in the sympathetic ganglia, as indicated by macrophage responses, satellite glia activation, and increased numbers of T cells, along with very modest increases in sympathetic neuron excitability (but not spontaneous activity) measured in ex vivo recordings. The spinal nerve ligation model generally caused larger responses than DRG inflammation. Plasticity of the sympathetic system should be recognized in studies of sympathetic effects on pain.","Action Potentials;Animals;Axons;Axotomy;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Environment;Female;Ganglia, Sensory;Ganglia, Spinal;Ganglia, Sympathetic;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injuries;Lead;Ligation;Macrophages;Male;Neuralgia;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neurons;Pain;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Peripheral Nerves;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta;Satellite Glia;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Nerves;T-Lymphocytes",Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injuries;Neuralgia;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Neurosci Bull,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Understanding the underlying analgesic mechanisms requires animal models. The aim of the current study was to develop an animal model for the analgesic actions of LVVA-SM in the setting of peripheral neuropathic pain. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve tibial and common peroneal branches were transected, sparing the sural branch (spared nerve injury, SNI). After 15-18 days, rats were assigned randomly to one of three groups (n=9 each group): LVVA-SM at 0.15-or 0.16-Hz or Control. LVVA-SM (20° flexion at the L5 vertebra with an innovative motorized treatment table) was administered in anesthetized rats for 10 min. Control rats were administered anesthesia and positioned on the treatment table. After 10, 25, and 40 min, the plantar skin of the hindpaw ipsilateral to SNI was tested for mechanical sensitivity (paw withdrawal threshold to a logarithmic series of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) and cold sensitivity (duration of paw lifting, shaking, and/or licking to topical acetone application). SNI produced behavioral signs of mechanical and cold allodynia. LVVA-SM reduced mechanical, but not cold, hypersensitivity compared with Control (0.15-Hz: P=0.04 at 10 min; 0.16-Hz: P&lt;0.001 at 10 min, P=0.04 at 25 min).

29847797,2018,Inhibition of Neuroinflammation by AIBP: Spinal Effects upon Facilitated Pain States.,"Apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP) reduces lipid raft abundance by augmenting the removal of excess cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Here, we report that AIBP prevents and reverses processes associated with neuroinflammatory-mediated spinal nociceptive processing. The mechanism involves AIBP binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and increased binding of AIBP to activated microglia, which mediates selective regulation of lipid rafts in inflammatory cells. AIBP-mediated lipid raft reductions downregulate LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization, inflammatory signaling, and expression of cytokines in microglia. In mice, intrathecal injections of AIBP reduce spinal myeloid cell lipid rafts, TLR4 dimerization, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Intrathecal AIBP reverses established allodynia in mice in which pain states were induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin, intraplantar formalin, or intrathecal LPS, all of which are pro-nociceptive interventions known to be regulated by TLR4 signaling. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which AIBP regulates neuroinflammation and suggest the therapeutic potential of AIBP in treating preexisting pain states.","Allodynia;Animals;Apolipoprotein A-I;Binding Proteins;Carrier Proteins;Cell Membrane;Cells;Cholesterol;Chronic Pain;Cisplatin;Cytokines;Dimerization;Drug Therapy;Formaldehyde;Formalin;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injections, Intrathecal;Lipids;Lipopolysaccharides;Membrane Microdomains;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Motor Activity;Myeloid Cells;Neuralgia;Pain;Protein Multimerization;Regulation;Report;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics;Toll-Like Receptor 4",Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Pain,Cell Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30152715,2019,Exercise-Induced Changes to the Macrophage Response in the Dorsal Root Ganglia Prevent Neuropathic Pain after Spinal Cord Injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces neuropathic pain that is refractory to treatment. Central and peripheral immune responses to SCI play critical roles in pain development. Although immune responses in the dorsal horn have been implicated in SCI-pain, immune mechanisms in the periphery, especially in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where nociceptor cell bodies reside, have not been well studied. Exercise is an immunomodulator, and we showed previously that early exercise after SCI reduces pain development. However, the mechanisms of exercise-mediated pain reduction are not understood. Therefore, we examined the 1) underlying immune differences in the spinal cord and DRG between rats with and without pain and 2) immunomodulatory effects of exercise in pain reduction. Rats were subjected to a unilateral contusion at C5 and tested for pain development using von Frey and mechanical conflict-avoidance paradigms. A subgroup of rats was exercised on forced running wheels starting at 5 days post-injury for 4 weeks. We observed greater microglial activation in the C7-C8 dorsal horn of rats with SCI-induced pain compared to rats with normal sensation, and early exercise reduced this activation independently of pain behavior. Further, abnormal pain sensation strongly correlated with an increased number of DRG macrophages. Importantly, exercise-treated rats that maintain normal sensation also have a lower number of macrophages in the DRG. Our data suggest that macrophage presence in the DRG may be an important effector of pain development, and early wheel walking exercise may mediate pain prevention by modulating the injury-induced macrophage response in the DRG. Further supportive evidence demonstrated that rats that developed pain despite exercise intervention still displayed a significantly elevated number of macrophages in the DRG. Collectively, these data suggest that macrophage presence in the DRG may be an amenable cellular target for future therapies.","Animals;Behavior;Cell Body;Contusions;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Exercise;Female;Future;Ganglia, Spinal;Immunity;Immunomodulators;Inflammation;Injuries;Macrophages;Neuralgia;Nociceptors;Pain;Physical Conditioning, Animal;Play;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Rehabilitation;Role;Running;Sensation;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Spinal Cord Injuries;Therapeutics;Walking",Contusions;Inflammation;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Spinal Cord Injuries,J Neurotrauma,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30618345,2019,Sexual Dimorphism of Pain Control: Analgesic Effects of Pioglitazone and Azithromycin in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury.,"Central neuropathic pain develops in greater than 75% of individuals suffering a spinal cord injury (SCI). Increasingly, sex is recognized as an important biological variable in the development and treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, but much less is known about the role of sex in central neuropathic pain and its pharmacological inhibition. To test the hypothesis that efficacy of analgesic therapies differs between males and females in SCI, we used a mouse model of SCI pain to determine the analgesic efficacy of pioglitazone (PIO), U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of diabetes, and azithromycin (AZM), a commonly prescribed macrolide antibiotic with immunomodulatory properties. Male and female mice received moderate-severe T9 contusion SCI (75-kdyn). A robust heat hyperalgesia developed similarly between male and female mice by 4 weeks post-injury and lasted throughout the duration of the study (14 weeks). Three months after SCI, mice were treated with PIO (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or AZM (160 mg/kg, oral). We observed a sex-specific effect of PIO with significant antihyperalgesic effects in females, but not males. In contrast, AZM was effective in both sexes. Our data support the use of PIO and AZM as novel therapies for SCI pain and highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical and experimental SCI pain research.","Analgesics;Animals;Antibiotics;Azithromycin;Biopharmaceuticals;Chronic Pain;Contusions;Female;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Macrolides;Macrophages;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pioglitazone;Research;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Spinal Cord Injuries;Therapeutics;Thiazolidinediones;Treatment Outcome;United States Food and Drug Administration",Chronic Pain;Contusions;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Spinal Cord Injuries,J Neurotrauma,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30660616,2019,Opioid receptors inhibit the spinal AMPA receptor Ca2+ permeability that mediates latent pain sensitization.,"Acute inflammation induces sensitization of nociceptive neurons and triggers the accumulation of calcium permeable (CP) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This coincides with behavioral signs of acute inflammatory pain, but whether CP-AMPARs contribute to chronic pain remains unclear. To evaluate this question, we first constructed current-voltage (IV) curves of C-fiber stimulus-evoked, AMPAR-mediated EPSCs in lamina II to test for inward rectification, a key characteristic of CP-AMPARs. We found that the intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced an inward rectification at 3 d that persisted to 21 d after injury. Furthermore, the CP- AMPAR antagonist IEM-1460 (50 μM) inhibited AMPAR-evoked Ca2+ transients 21d after injury but had no effect in uninflamed mice. We then used a model of long-lasting vulnerability for chronic pain that is determined by the balance between latent central sensitization (LCS) and mu opioid receptor constitutive activity (MORCA). When administered 21 d after the intraplantar injection of CFA, intrathecal administration of the MORCA inverse agonist naltrexone (NTX, 1 μg, i.t.) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity, and superfusion of spinal cord slices with NTX (10 μM) increased the peak amplitude of AMPAR-evoked Ca2+ transients in lamina II neurons. The CP-AMPAR antagonist naspm (0-10 nmol, i.t.) inhibited these NTX-induced increases in mechanical hypersensitivity. NTX had no effect in uninflamed mice. Subsequent western blot analysis of the postsynaptic density membrane fraction from lumbar dorsal horn revealed that CFA increased GluA1 expression at 2 d and GluA4 expression at both 2 and 21 d post-injury, indicating that not just the GluA1 subunit, but also the GluA4 subunit, contributes to the expression of CP-AMPARs and synaptic strength during hyperalgesia. GluA2 expression increased at 21 d, an unexpected result that requires further study. We conclude that after tissue injury, dorsal horn AMPARs retain a Ca2+ permeability that underlies LCS. Because of their effectiveness in reducing naltrexone-induced reinstatement of hyperalgesia and potentiation of AMPAR-evoked Ca2+ signals, CP-AMPAR inhibitors are a promising class of agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain.","Adamantane;Administration;Animals;Blot, Western;C Fibers;Calcium;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chronic Pain;Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials;Freund's Adjuvant;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injections;Injuries;Isoxazoles;Male;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Permeability;Post-Synaptic Density;Posterior Horn Cells;Propionic Acids;Receptors, AMPA;Receptors, Glutamate;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Substantia Gelatinosa;Synapses;Therapeutics;Tissues;Transients",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injuries;Pain,Exp Neurol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30776373,2019,Signaling characteristics and functional regulation of delta opioid-kappa opioid receptor (DOP-KOP) heteromers in peripheral sensory neurons.,"Receptor heteromers often display distinct pharmacological and functional properties compared to the individual receptor constituents. In this study, we compared the properties of the DOP-KOP heteromer agonist, 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI), with agonists for DOP ([D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin [DPDPE]) and KOP (U50488) in peripheral sensory neurons in culture and in vivo. In primary cultures, all three agonists inhibited PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation as well as activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) with similar efficacy. ERK activation by U50488 was Gi-protein mediated but that by DPDPE or 6'-GNTI was Gi-protein independent (i.e., pertussis toxin insensitive). Brief pretreatment with DPDPE or U50488 resulted in loss of cAMP signaling, however, no desensitization occurred with 6'-GNTI pretreatment. In vivo, following intraplantar injection, all three agonists reduced thermal nociception. The dose-response curves for DPDPE and 6'-GNTI were monotonic whereas the curve for U50488 was an inverted U-shape. Inhibition of ERK blocked the downward phase and shifted the curve for U50488 to the right. Following intraplantar injection of carrageenan, antinociceptive responses to either DPDPE or U50488 were transient but could be prolonged with inhibitors of 12/15-lipoxgenases (LOX). By contrast, responsiveness to 6'-GNTI remained for a prolonged time in the absence of LOX inhibitors. Further, pretreatment with the 12/15-LOX metabolites, 12- and 15- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, abolished responses to U50488 and DPDPE but had no effect on 6'-GNTI-mediated responses either in cultures or in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that DOP-KOP heteromers exhibit unique signaling and functional regulation in peripheral sensory neurons and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Carrageenan;Culture;Cyclic AMP;Dinoprostone;Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-;Enkephalins;Exhibition;Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids;Injections;Male;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3;Nociception;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pertussis Toxin;Proteins;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Regulation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics;Time;Transients;U-50488",Pain;Whooping Cough,Neuropharmacology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30807826,2019,Methylglyoxal and a spinal TRPA1-AC1-Epac cascade facilitate pain in the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes.,"Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a devastating neurological complication of diabetes. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive metabolite whose elevation in the plasma corresponds to PDN in patients and pain-like behavior in rodent models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here, we addressed the MG-related spinal mechanisms of PDN in type 2 diabetes using db/db mice, an established model of type 2 diabetes, and intrathecal injection of MG in conventional C57BL/6J mice. Administration of either a MG scavenger (GERP10) or a vector overexpressing glyoxalase 1, the catabolic enzyme for MG, attenuated heat hypersensitivity in db/db mice. In C57BL/6J mice, intrathecal administration of MG produced signs of both evoked (heat and mechanical hypersensitivity) and affective (conditioned place avoidance) pain. MG-induced Ca2+ mobilization in lamina II dorsal horn neurons of C57BL/6J mice was exacerbated in db/db, suggestive of MG-evoked central sensitization. Pharmacological and/or genetic inhibition of transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 (TRPA1), adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1), protein kinase A (PKA), or exchange protein directly activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (Epac) blocked MG-evoked hypersensitivity in C57BL/6J mice. Similarly, intrathecal administration of GERP10, or inhibitors of TRPA1 (HC030031), AC1 (NB001), or Epac (HJC-0197) attenuated hypersensitivity in db/db mice. We conclude that MG and sensitization of a spinal TRPA1-AC1-Epac signaling cascade facilitate PDN in db/db mice.

30985364,2019,"Regulation of lipid rafts, angiogenesis and inflammation by AIBP.","Recent studies demonstrate an important role of the secreted apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP) in regulation of cholesterol efflux and lipid rafts. The article discusses these findings in the context of angiogenesis and inflammation. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-rich and sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains in which many receptor complexes assemble upon activation. AIBP mediates selective cholesterol efflux, in part via binding to toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in activated macrophages and microglia, and thus reverses lipid raft increases in activated cells. Recent articles report AIBP regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Notch1 and TLR4 function. In zebrafish and mouse animal models, AIBP deficiency results in accelerated angiogenesis, increased inflammation and exacerbated atherosclerosis. Spinal delivery of recombinant AIBP reduces neuraxial inflammation and reverses persistent pain state in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy. Inhalation of recombinant AIBP reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice. These findings are discussed in the perspective of AIBP's proposed other function, as an NAD(P)H hydrate epimerase, evolving into a regulator of cholesterol trafficking and lipid rafts. Novel findings of AIBP regulatory circuitry affecting lipid rafts and related cellular processes may provide new therapeutic avenues for angiogenic and inflammatory diseases.","Acute Lung Injury;Animals;Apolipoprotein A-I;Atherosclerosis;Binding Proteins;Cells;Cholesterol;Disease;Drug Therapy;Epimerases;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Inflammation;Inhalation;Lipids;Lipopolysaccharides;Macrophages;Membrane Microdomains;Membranes;Mice;Microglia;Models, Animal;NAD;Neovascularization, Physiologic;News;Pain;Phosphoproteins;Polyneuropathies;Regulation;Report;Role;Sphingomyelins;Therapeutics;Toll-Like Receptor 4;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2;Zebrafish",Acute Lung Injury;Atherosclerosis;Inflammation;Pain;Polyneuropathies,Curr Opin Lipidol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31308053,2019,TRESK K+ Channel Activity Regulates Trigeminal Nociception and Headache.,"Although TWIK-related spinal cord K+ (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4-). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4- dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4+). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.","Adult;Affect;Animals;Behavior;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Genetics;Headache;Humans;Isolectins;Male;Membrane Potentials;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Migraine Disorders;Mutation;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Potassium Channels;Spinal Cord;Time;Trigeminal Ganglion;Visceral Pain",Ganglion Cysts;Headache;Migraine Disorders;Pain;Visceral Pain,eNeuro,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

31686009,2019,A pH-responsive nanoparticle targets the neurokinin 1 receptor in endosomes to prevent chronic pain.,"Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is especially useful for targets within endosomes because of the endosomal transport mechanisms of many nanomedicines within cells. Here, we report the design of a pH-responsive, soft polymeric nanoparticle for the targeting of acidified endosomes to precisely inhibit endosomal signalling events leading to chronic pain. In chronic pain, the substance P (SP) neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) redistributes from the plasma membrane to acidified endosomes, where it signals to maintain pain. Therefore, the NK1R in endosomes provides an important target for pain relief. The pH-responsive nanoparticles enter cells by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis and accumulate in NK1R-containing endosomes. Following intrathecal injection into rodents, the nanoparticles, containing the FDA-approved NK1R antagonist aprepitant, inhibit SP-induced activation of spinal neurons and thus prevent pain transmission. Treatment with the nanoparticles leads to complete and persistent relief from nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic nociception and offers a much-needed non-opioid treatment option for chronic pain.","Animals;Aprepitant;Cell Line;Cell Membrane;Cells;Chronic Pain;Clathrin;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Delivery Systems;Dynamins;Endocytosis;Endosomes;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Injections, Intrathecal;Lead;Male;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Nanomedicine;Nanoparticles;Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists;Neurons;Nociception;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Receptors, Neurokinin-1;Report;Rodentia;Substance P;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Pain,Nat Nanotechnol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Here, we define a pathway whereby GABAergic neurons from the central nucleus of the amygdala (GABACeA) project to glutamatergic neurons in the parafascicular nucleus (GluPF). These GluPF neurons relay directly to neurons in the second somatosensory cortex (S2), a well-known area involved in pain signal processing. Enhanced inhibition of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway is found in mice exhibiting CP symptoms. Reversing this pathway using chemogenetic or optogenetic approaches alleviates CP symptoms. Together, the current study demonstrates the putative importance of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway in controlling at least some aspects of CP.",Animals;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Depression;GABAergic Neurons;Glutamates;Intralaminar Thalamic Nuclei;Male;Mice;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Optogenetics;Pain;Parafascicular Thalamic Nucleus;Somatosensory Cortex,Pain,Cell Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31862695,2020,Lipid rafts in glial cells: role in neuroinflammation and pain processing.,"Activation of microglia and astrocytes secondary to inflammatory processes contributes to the development and perpetuation of pain with a neuropathic phenotype. This pain state presents as a chronic debilitating condition and affects a large population of patients with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, or after surgery, trauma, or chemotherapy. Here, we review the regulation of lipid rafts in glial cells and the role they play as a key component of neuroinflammatory sensitization of central pain signaling pathways. In this context, we introduce the concept of an inflammaraft (i-raft), enlarged lipid rafts harboring activated receptors and adaptor molecules and serving as an organizing platform to initiate inflammatory signaling and the cellular response. Characteristics of the inflammaraft include increased relative abundance of lipid rafts in inflammatory cells, increased content of cholesterol per raft, and increased levels of inflammatory receptors, such as toll-like receptor (TLR)4, adaptor molecules, ion channels, and enzymes in lipid rafts. This inflammaraft motif serves an important role in the membrane assembly of protein complexes, for example, TLR4 dimerization. Operating within this framework, we demonstrate the involvement of inflammatory receptors, redox molecules, and ion channels in the inflammaraft formation and the regulation of cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism in the inflammaraft maintenance and disruption. Strategies for targeting inflammarafts, without affecting the integrity of lipid rafts in noninflammatory cells, may lead to developing novel therapies for neuropathic pain states and other neuroinflammatory conditions.","Affect;Animals;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Astrocytes;Cells;Cholesterol;Dimerization;Drug Therapy;Enzymes;General Surgery;Humans;Inflammation;Ion Channels;Lead;Lipids;Maintenance;Membrane Microdomains;Membrane Proteins;Membranes;Metabolism;Microglia;Neuralgia;Neuroglia;Oxidation-Reduction;Pain;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Population;Proteins;Regulation;Relatives;Review;Role;Sphingolipids;Therapeutics;Toll-Like Receptors;Wounds and Injuries","Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Pain;Wounds and Injuries",J Lipid Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31863796,2020,GluA1 in Central Amygdala Promotes Opioid Use and Reverses Inhibitory Effect of Pain.,"Increasing evidence suggests that long-term opioids and pain induce similar adaptive changes in the brain's reward circuits, however, how pain alters the addictive properties of opioids remains poorly understood. In this study using a rat model of morphine self-administration (MSA), we found that short-term pain, induced by an intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), acutely decreased voluntary morphine intake, but not food intake, only at a morphine dose that did not affect pain itself. Pre-treatment with indomethacin, a non-opioid inhibitor of pain, before the pain induction blocked the decrease in morphine intake. In rats with steady MSA, the protein level of GluA1 subunits of glutamate AMPA receptors (AMPARs) was significantly increased, but that of GluA2 was decreased, resulting in an increased GluA1/GluA2 ratio in central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In contrast, pain decreased the GluA1/GluA2 ratio in the CeA of rats with MSA. Microinjection of NASPM, a selective inhibitor of homomeric GluA1-AMPARs, into CeA inhibited morphine intake. Furthermore, viral overexpression of GluA1 protein in CeA maintained morphine intake at a higher level than controls and reversed the pain-induced reduction in morphine intake. These findings suggest that CeA GluA1 promotes opioid use and its upregulation is sufficient to increase opioid consumption, which counteracts the acute inhibitory effect of pain on opioid intake. These results demonstrate that the CeA GluA1 is a shared target of opioid and pain in regulation of opioid use, which may aid in future development of therapeutic applications in opioid abuse.","Affect;Amygdala;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Brain;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Chronic Pain;Consumption;Eating;Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials;Freund's Adjuvant;Future;Glutamates;Glutamic Acid;Indomethacin;Injections;Male;Microinjections;Morphine;Opioid Abuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Proteins;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Receptors, AMPA;Receptors, Glutamate;Regulation;Reward;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Up-Regulation",Chronic Pain;Opioid Abuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Neuroscience,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31917219,2020,Alternative Splicing of Nrcam Gene in Dorsal Root Ganglion Contributes to Neuropathic Pain.,"NrCAM, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule in the L1 family of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is subjected to extensively alternative splicing and involved in neural development and some disorders. The aim of this study was to explore the role of Nrcam mRNA alternative splicing in neuropathic pain. A next generation RNA sequencing analysis of dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) showed the differential expression of two splicing variants of Nrcam, Nrcam+10 and Nrcam-10, in the injured DRG after the fourth lumbar spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in mice. SNL increased the exon 10 insertion, resulting in an increase in the amount of Nrcam+10 and a corresponding decrease in the level of Nrcam-10 in the injured DRG. An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that specifically targeted exon 10 of Nrcam gene (Nrcam ASO) repressed RNA expression of Nrcam+10 and increased RNA expression of Nrcam-10 in in vitro DRG cell culture. Either DRG microinjection or intrathecal injection of Nrcam ASO attenuated SNL-induced the development of mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, or cold allodynia. Nrcam ASO also relieved SNL- or chronic compression of DRG (CCD)-induced the maintenance of pain hypersensitivities in male and female mice. PERSPECTIVE: We conclude that the relative levels of alternatively spliced Nrcam variants are critical for neuropathic pain genesis. Targeting Nrcam alternative splicing via the antisense oligonucleotides may be a new potential avenue in neuropathic pain management.","Allodynia;Alternative Splicing;Animals;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal;Cell Culture Techniques;Cold Temperature;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Exons;Family;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Genes;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Immunoglobulins;In Vitro;Injections, Intrathecal;Injections, Spinal;Ligation;Maintenance;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microinjections;Neuralgia;News;Oligonucleotides, Antisense;Pain;RNA;RNA, Messenger;Relatives;Role;Sequence Analysis, RNA;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Spinal Nerves","Allodynia;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain",J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31999650,2020,GPR160 de-orphanization reveals critical roles in neuropathic pain in rodents.,"Treating neuropathic pain is challenging and novel non-opioid-based medicines are needed. Using unbiased receptomics, transcriptomic analyses, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of the orphan GPCR Gpr160 and GPR160 increased in the rodent dorsal horn of the spinal cord following traumatic nerve injury. Genetic and immunopharmacological approaches demonstrated that GPR160 inhibition in the spinal cord prevented and reversed neuropathic pain in male and female rodents without altering normal pain response. GPR160 inhibition in the spinal cord attenuated sensory processing in the thalamus, a key relay in the sensory discriminative pathways of pain. We also identified cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) as a GPR160 ligand. Inhibiting endogenous CARTp signaling in spinal cord attenuated neuropathic pain, whereas exogenous intrathecal CARTp evoked painful hypersensitivity through GPR160-dependent ERK and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Our findings de-orphanize GPR160, identify it as a determinant of neuropathic pain and potential therapeutic target, and provide insights into its signaling pathways. CARTp is involved in many diseases including depression and reward and addiction; de-orphanization of GPR160 is a major step forward understanding the role of CARTp signaling in health and disease.","Amphetamine;Animals;Cell Line;Child, Orphaned;Cocaine;Comprehension;Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein;Depression;Disease;Female;Genetics;Health;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Immunofluorescence;In Situ Hybridization;Injuries;Ligands;Male;Medicine;Mice;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Neuralgia;Neurosciences;Opioids;PC12 Cells;Pain;Peptides;Perception;RNA, Small Interfering;Rats;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Reward;Rodentia;Role;Sciatic Nerve;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Thalamus;Therapeutics;Up-Regulation",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,J Clin Invest,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32003253,2020,Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP): role in migraine pathophysiology and therapeutic targeting.,"Introduction: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is recognized as a critical player in migraine pathophysiology. Excitement has grown regarding CGRP because of the development and clinical testing of drugs targeting CGRP or its receptor. While these drugs alleviate migraine symptoms in half of the patients, the remaining unresponsive half of this population creates an impetus to address unanswered questions that exist in this field.Areas covered: We describe the role of CGRP in migraine pathophysiology and CGRP-targeted therapeutics currently under development and in use. We also discuss how a second CGRP receptor may provide a new therapeutic target.Expert opinion: CGRP-targeting drugs have shown a remarkable safety profile. We speculate that this may reflect the redundancy of peptides within the CGRP family and a second CGRP receptor that may compensate for reduced CGRP activity. Furthermore, we propose that an inherent safety feature of peptide-blocking antibodies is attributed to the fundamental nature of peptide release, which occurs as a large bolus in short bursts of volume transmission. These facts support the development of more refined CGRP therapeutic drugs, as well as drugs that target other neuropeptides. We believe that the future of migraine research is bright with exciting advances on the horizon.","Address;Animals;Antibodies, Blocking;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Development;Expert Opinion;Family;Future;GEPANTS;Humans;Migraine Disorders;Molecular Targeted Therapy;Nature;Neuropeptides;News;Patients;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Receptors, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Research;Role;Safety;Therapeutics",Migraine Disorders,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32005763,2020,SIRT1 Decreases Emotional Pain Vulnerability with Associated CaMKIIα Deacetylation in Central Amygdala.,"Emotional disorders are common comorbid conditions that further exacerbate the severity and chronicity of chronic pain. However, individuals show considerable vulnerability to the development of chronic pain under similar pain conditions. In this study on male rat and mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain, we identify the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in central amygdala as a key epigenetic regulator that controls the development of comorbid emotional disorders underlying the individual vulnerability to chronic pain. We found that animals that were vulnerable to developing behaviors of anxiety and depression under the pain condition displayed reduced SIRT1 protein levels in central amygdala, but not those animals resistant to the emotional disorders. Viral overexpression of local SIRT1 reversed this vulnerability, but viral knockdown of local SIRT1 mimicked the pain effect, eliciting the pain vulnerability in pain-free animals. The SIRT1 action was associated with CaMKIIα downregulation and deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at the CaMKIIα promoter. These results suggest that, by transcriptional repression of CaMKIIα in central amygdala, SIRT1 functions to guard against the emotional pain vulnerability under chronic pain conditions. This study indicates that SIRT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for individualized treatment of chronic pain with vulnerable emotional disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic pain is a prevalent neurological disease with no effective treatment at present. Pain patients display considerably variable vulnerability to developing chronic pain, indicating individual-based molecular mechanisms underlying the pain vulnerability, which is hardly addressed in current preclinical research. In this study, we have identified the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a key regulator that controls this pain vulnerability. This study reveals that the SIRT1-CaMKIIaα pathway in central amygdala acts as an epigenetic mechanism that guards against the development of comorbid emotional disorders under chronic pain, and that its dysfunction causes increased vulnerability to the development of chronic pain. These findings suggest that SIRT1 activators may be used in a novel therapeutic approach for individual-based treatment of chronic pain.","Acetylation;Animals;Anxiety;Behavior;Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Chronic Pain;Depression;Disease;Disease Susceptibility;Down-Regulation;Epigenetics;Exploratory Behavior;GABAergic Neurons;Genetic Vectors;Histone Deacetylases;Histone H3;Histones;Hyperalgesia;Lysine;Male;Mice;Neuralgia;Pain;Patients;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Proteins;Psychological Distress;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Research;Sirtuin 1;Swimming;Therapeutics;Transcription, Genetic;Trigeminal Neuralgia",Chronic Pain;Disease Susceptibility;Hyperalgesia;Neuralgia;Pain;Trigeminal Neuralgia,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32047493,2020,Neuraxial Cytokines in Pain States.,"A high-intensity potentially tissue-injuring stimulus generates a homotopic response to escape the stimulus and is associated with an affective phenotype considered to represent pain. In the face of tissue or nerve injury, the afferent encoding systems display robust changes in the input-output function, leading to an ongoing sensation reported as painful and sensitization of the nociceptors such that an enhanced pain state is reported for a given somatic or visceral stimulus. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this non-linear processing of nociceptive stimuli has led to our appreciation of the role played by the functional interactions of neural and immune signaling systems in pain phenotypes. In pathological states, neural systems interact with the immune system through the actions of a variety of soluble mediators, including cytokines. Cytokines are recognized as important mediators of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, supporting system sensitization and the development of a persistent pathologic pain. Cytokines can induce a facilitation of nociceptive processing at all levels of the neuraxis including supraspinal centers where nociceptive input evokes an affective component of the pain state. We review here several key proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and explore their underlying actions at four levels of neuronal organization: (1) peripheral nociceptor termini; (2) dorsal root ganglia; (3) spinal cord; and (4) supraspinal areas. Thus, current thinking suggests that cytokines by this action throughout the neuraxis play key roles in the induction of pain and the maintenance of the facilitated states of pain behavior generated by tissue injury/inflammation and nerve injury.","Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Behavior;Biomarkers;Chemokines;Comprehension;Cytokines;Disease Susceptibility;Face;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Immune System;Inflammation;Injuries;Maintenance;Molecular Targeted Therapy;Multigene Family;Neuralgia;Nociceptors;Organizations;Pain;Phenotype;Play;Review;Role;Sensation;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Thinking;Tissues",Disease Susceptibility;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Inflammation;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Front Immunol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32071073,2020,The Operant Plantar Thermal Assay: A Novel Device for Assessing Thermal Pain Tolerance in Mice.,"Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.","Administration;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Behavior;Clonidine;Constriction;Decision Making;Devices;Disease Models, Animal;Female;Freund's Adjuvant;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injuries;Learning;Male;Measures;Meloxicam;Methods;Mice;Neuralgia;News;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain Threshold;Research;Reward;Solutions;Sucrose;Temperature;Time",Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,eNeuro,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32099850,2020,Long noncoding RNA H19 in the injured dorsal root ganglion contributes to peripheral nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity.,"Peripheral nerve injury-induced changes in gene transcription and translation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. Here, we report that peripheral nerve injury caused by ligation of the fourth spinal nerve (SNL) led to a time-dependent increase in the expression in H19, an lncRNA, in the injured DRG. Microinjection of a specific H19 siRNA, but not negative control scrambled siRNA, into the injured DRG 4 days before SNL alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 3 and 5 post-SNL. Additionally, DRG microinjection of the H19 siRNA on day 7 after SNL reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 10 and 12 post-SNL. DRG microinjection of neither siRNA affected locomotor activity and acute basal responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Our findings suggest that H19 participates in the peripheral mechanism underlying the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. H19 may be a potential target for treatment of this disorder.","Diagnosis-Related Groups;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Genes;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Ligation;Locomotion;Maintenance;Mechanical Allodynia;Microinjections;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Play;RNA, Long Noncoding;RNA, Small Interfering;Report;Role;Spinal Nerves;Therapeutics;Time;Translations","Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries",Transl Perioper Pain Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

32200043,2020,MeCP2 mediates transgenerational transmission of chronic pain.,"Pain symptoms can be transmitted across generations, but the mechanisms underlying these outcomes remain poorly understood. Here, we identified an essential role for primary somatosensory cortical (S1) glutamate neuronal DNA methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in the transgenerational transmission of pain. In a female mouse chronic pain model, the offspring displayed significant pain sensitization. In these mice, MeCP2 expression was increased in S1 glutamate (GluS1) neurons, correlating with increased neuronal activity. Downregulation of GluS1 neuronal MeCP2 in maternal mice with pain abolished offspring pain sensitization, whereas overexpression of MeCP2 in naïve maternal mice induced pain sensitization in offspring. Notably, single-cell sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the expression of a wide range of genes was changed in offspring and maternal GluS1 neurons, some of which were regulated by MeCP2. These results collectively demonstrate the putative importance of MeCP2 as a key regulator in pain transgenerational transmission through actions on GluS1 neuronal maladaptation.","Animals;Behavior, Animal;Cells;Chromatin Immunoprecipitation;Chronic Pain;DNA;Disease Models, Animal;Down-Regulation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Generations;Genes;Glutamates;Glutamic Acid;Hyperalgesia;Male;Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Pain;Primary Somatosensory Cortex;Role;Somatosensory Cortex;Up-Regulation",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Pain,Prog Neurobiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32205121,2020,Toll-like receptor 7 contributes to neuropathic pain by activating NF-κB in primary sensory neurons.,"Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) is expressed in neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), but whether it contributes to neuropathic pain is elusive. We found that peripheral nerve injury caused by ligation of the fourth lumbar (L4) spinal nerve (SNL) or chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve led to a significant increase in the expression of TLR7 at mRNA and protein levels in mouse injured DRG. Blocking this increase through microinjection of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) 5 expressing TLR7 shRNA into the ipsilateral L4 DRG alleviated the SNL-induced mechanical, thermal and cold pain hypersensitivities in both male and female mice. This microinjection also attenuated the SNL-induced increases in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (p-ERK1/2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in L4 dorsal horn on the ipsilateral side during both development and maintenance periods. Conversely, mimicking this increase through microinjection of AAV5 expressing full-length TLR7 into unilateral L3/4 DRGs led to elevations in the amounts of p-ERK1/2 and GFAP in the dorsal horn, augmented responses to mechanical, thermal and cold stimuli, and induced the spontaneous pain on the ipsilateral side in the absence of SNL. Mechanistically, the increased TLR7 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway through promoting the translocation of p65 into the nucleus and phosphorylation of p65 in the nucleus from the injured DRG neurons. Our findings suggest that DRG TLR7 contributes to neuropathic pain by activating NF-κB in primary sensory neurons. TLR7 may be a potential target for therapeutic treatment of this disorder.","Adeno-Associated Virus;Animals;Cold Temperature;Constriction;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Ligation;Maintenance;Male;Membrane Glycoproteins;Mice;Microinjections;NF-kappa B;Neuralgia;Neurons;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Phosphorylation;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Sciatic Nerve;Sensory Receptor Cells;Short Hairpin RNA;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Spinal Nerves;Therapeutics;Toll-Like Receptor 7",Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

32404819,2020,Local Sympathectomy Promotes Anti-inflammatory Responses and Relief of Paclitaxel-induced Mechanical and Cold Allodynia in Mice.,"Patients undergoing cancer treatment often experience chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain at their extremities, for which there is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug. The authors hypothesized that local sympathetic blockade, which is used in the clinic to treat various pain conditions, can also be effective to treat chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. A local sympathectomy (i.e., cutting the ipsilateral gray rami entering the spinal nerves near the L3 and L4 dorsal root ganglia) was performed in mice receiving intraperitoneal injections every other day of the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel. Sympathectomy effects were then assessed in chemotherapy-induced pain-like behaviors (i.e., mechanical and cold allodynia) and neuroimmune and electrophysiologic responses. Local microsympathectomy produced a fast recovery from mechanical allodynia (mean ± SD: sympathectomy vs. sham at day 5, 1.07 ± 0.34 g vs. 0.51 ± 0.17g, n = 5, P = 0.030 in male mice, and 1.08 ± 0.28 g vs. 0.62 ± 0.16 g, n = 5, P = 0.036 in female mice) and prevented the development of cold allodynia in both male and female mice after paclitaxel. Mechanistically, microsympathectomy induced transcriptional increases in dorsal root ganglia of macrophage markers and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as the transforming growth factor-β. Accordingly, depletion of monocytes/macrophages and blockade of transforming growth factor-β signaling reversed the relief of mechanical allodynia by microsympathectomy. In particular, exogenous transforming growth factor-β was sufficient to relieve mechanical allodynia after paclitaxel (transforming growth factor-β 100 ng/site vs. vehicle at 3 h, 1.21 ± 0.34g vs. 0.53 ± 0.14 g, n = 5, P = 0.001 in male mice), and transforming growth factor-β signaling regulated neuronal activity in dorsal root ganglia. Local sympathetic nerves control the progression of immune responses in dorsal root ganglia and pain-like behaviors in mice after paclitaxel, raising the possibility that clinical strategies already in use for local sympathetic blockade may also offer an effective treatment for patients experiencing chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.","Allodynia;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Behavior;Cancer;Cold Temperature;Cytokines;Disease Models, Animal;Drug Therapy;Extremities;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Hyperalgesia;Immunity;Inflammation;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Macrophages;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Monocytes;Neuralgia;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Spinal Nerves;Sympathectomy;Therapeutics;Transforming Growth Factor beta;United States Food and Drug Administration",Allodynia;Cancer;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain,Anesthesiology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32413559,2020,"Germinal center formation, immunoglobulin production and hindlimb nociceptive sensitization after tibia fracture.","Emerging evidence suggests that Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is in part a post-traumatic autoimmune disease mediated by an adaptive immune response after limb injuries. We previously observed in a murine tibial fracture model of CRPS that pain-related behaviors were dependent upon adaptive immune mechanisms including the neuropeptide-dependent production of IgM for 5 months after injury. However, the time course of induction of this immune response and the demonstration of germinal center formation in lymphoid organs has not been evaluated. Using the murine fracture model, we employed behavioral tests of nociceptive sensitization and limb dysfunction, serum passive transfer techniques, western blot analysis of IgM accumulation, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of lymphoid tissues and immunohistochemistry to follow the temporal activation of the adaptive immune response over the first 3 weeks after fracture. We observed that: 1) IgM protein levels in the skin of the fractured mice were elevated at 3 weeks post fracture, but not at earlier time points, 2) serum from fracture mice at 3 weeks, but not 1 and 2 weeks post fracture, had pro-nociceptive effects when passively transferred to fractured muMT mice lacking B cells, 3) fracture induced popliteal lymphadenopathy occurred ipsilateral to fracture beginning at 1 week and peaking at 3 weeks post fracture, 4) a germinal center reaction was detected by FACS analysis in the popliteal lymph nodes from injured limbs by 3 weeks post fracture but not in other lymphoid tissues, 5) germinal center formation was characterized by the induction of T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and germinal center B cells in the popliteal lymph nodes of the injured but not contralateral limbs, and 6) fracture mice treated with the Tfh signaling inhibitor FK506 had impaired germinal center reactions, reduced IgM levels, reduced nociceptive sensitization, and no pronociceptive serum effects after administration to fractured muMT mice. Collectively these data demonstrate that tibia fracture induces an adaptive autoimmune response characterized by popliteal lymph node germinal center formation and Tfh cell dependent B cell activation, resulting in nociceptive sensitization within 3 weeks.","Adaptive Immune Response;Adaptive Immunity;Administration;Animals;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Response;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;Behavior;Behavior Test;Blot, Western;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Disease Models, Animal;Extremities;FK-506;Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting;Germinal Center;Hindlimb;Immunity;Immunoglobulin M;Immunoglobulins;Immunohistochemistry;Injuries;Lymph Nodes;Lymphadenopathy;Lymphoid Tissue;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neuropeptides;Nociception;Pain;Production;Proteins;Serum;Skin;T Follicular Helper Cells;T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer;Tibia;Tibial Fractures;Time",Autoimmune Diseases;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Injuries;Lymphadenopathy;Pain;Tibial Fractures,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32424286,2020,General anesthetics activate a potent central pain-suppression circuit in the amygdala.,"General anesthesia (GA) can produce analgesia (loss of pain) independent of inducing loss of consciousness, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that GA suppresses pain in part by activating supraspinal analgesic circuits. We discovered a distinct population of GABAergic neurons activated by GA in the mouse central amygdala (CeAGA neurons). In vivo calcium imaging revealed that different GA drugs activate a shared ensemble of CeAGA neurons. CeAGA neurons also possess basal activity that mostly reflects animals' internal state rather than external stimuli. Optogenetic activation of CeAGA potently suppressed both pain-elicited reflexive and self-recuperating behaviors across sensory modalities and abolished neuropathic pain-induced mechanical (hyper-)sensitivity. Conversely, inhibition of CeAGA activity exacerbated pain, produced strong aversion and canceled the analgesic effect of low-dose ketamine. CeAGA neurons have widespread inhibitory projections to many affective pain-processing centers. Our study points to CeAGA as a potential powerful therapeutic target for alleviating chronic pain.","Amygdala;Analgesia;Analgesics;Anesthesia, General;Anesthetics, General;Animals;Behavior;Calcium;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Chronic Pain;Female;GABAergic Neurons;Ketamine;Male;Mice;Neural Pathways;Neuralgia;Neurons;Optogenetics;Pain;Pain Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Projection;Self;Sensitivity;Therapeutics;Unconsciousness",Chronic Pain;Neuralgia;Pain;Unconsciousness,Nat Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32597310,2020,"Effect of Sex on Motor Function, Lesion Size, and Neuropathic Pain after Contusion Spinal Cord Injury in Mice.","Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes neurodegeneration, impairs locomotor function, and impacts the quality of life particularly in those individuals in whom neuropathic pain develops. Whether the time course of neurodegeneration, locomotor impairment, or neuropathic pain varies with sex, however, remains understudied. Therefore, the objective of this study in male and female C57BL/6 mice was to evaluate the following outcomes for six weeks after a 75-kdyn thoracic contusion SCI: locomotor function using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS); spinal cord tissue sparing and rostral-caudal lesion length; and mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia using hindpaw application of Von Frey filaments or radiant heat stimuli, respectively. Although motor function was largely similar between sexes, all of the males, but only half of the females, recovered plantar stepping. Rostral-caudal lesion length was shorter in females than in males. Mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia after SCI developed in all animals, regardless of sex; there were no differences in pain outcomes between sexes. We conclude that contusion SCI yields subtle sex differences in mice depending on the outcome measure but no significant differences in behavioral signs of neuropathic pain.","Animals;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;Contusions;Female;Gender;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Locomotion;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neuralgia;Outcome Measures;Pain;Quality of Life;Scales;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Contusion;Spinal Cord Injuries;Time;Tissues",Contusions;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Spinal Cord Contusion;Spinal Cord Injuries,J Neurotrauma,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32639368,2020,Quantitative differences in neuronal subpopulations between mouse and human dorsal root ganglia demonstrated with RNAscope in situ hybridization.,"Next-generation transcriptomics in combination with imaging-based approaches have emerged as powerful tools for the characterization of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal subpopulations. The mouse DRG has been well characterized by many independently conducted studies with convergent findings, but few studies have directly compared expression of population markers between mouse and human. This is important because of our increasing reliance on the mouse as a preclinical model for translational studies. Although calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and P2X purinergic ion channel type 3 receptor (P2X3R) have been used to define peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptor subpopulations, respectively, in mouse DRG, these populations may be different in other species. To directly test this, as well as a host of other markers, we used multiplex RNAscope in situ hybridization to elucidate the distribution of a multitude of unique and classic neuronal mRNAs in peptidergic (CGRP-expressing) and nonpeptidergic (P2X3R-expressing) nociceptor subpopulations in mouse and human DRG. We found a large overlapping CGRP and P2X3R neuronal subpopulation in human, lumbar DRG that was not present in mouse. We also found differential expression in a variety of mRNAs for transient receptor potential channels, cholinergic receptors, potassium channels, sodium channels, and other markers/targets. These data offer insights into the spatial and functional organization of neuronal cell subpopulations in the rodent and human DRG and support the idea that sensory system organizational principles are likely different between both species.","Animals;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Humans;In Situ Hybridization;Ion Channels;Male;Mice;Middle Aged;Neurons;Nociceptors;Organizations;Population;Potassium Channels;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Cholinergic;Receptors, Purinergic P2X3;Rodentia;Sodium Channels;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Young Adult",Ganglion Cysts,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32701850,2020,Localized sympathectomy reduces peripheral nerve regeneration and pain behaviors in 2 rat neuropathic pain models.,"Previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve regeneration process is linked to pain in several neuropathic pain models. Other studies show that sympathetic blockade may relieve pain in some pain models and clinical conditions. This study examined reduction in peripheral nerve regeneration as one possible mechanism for relief of neuropathic pain by sympathetic blockade. A ""microsympathectomy,"" consisting of cutting the gray rami containing sympathetic postganglionic axons where they enter the L4 and L5 spinal nerves, reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in 2 different rat neuropathic pain models. In the spinal nerve ligation model, in which some functional regeneration and reinnervation of the ligated spinal nerve can be observed, microsympathectomy reduced functional and anatomical measures of regeneration as well as expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a regeneration-related protein. In the spared nerve injury model, in which functional reinnervation is not possible and the futile regeneration process results in formation of a neuroma, microsympathectomy reduced neuroma formation and GAP43 expression. In both models, microsympathectomy reduced macrophage density in the sensory ganglia and peripheral nerve. This corroborates previous work showing that sympathetic nerves may locally affect immune function. The results further highlight the challenge of improving pain in neuropathic conditions without inhibiting peripheral nerve regeneration that might otherwise be possible and desired.","Affect;Animals;Axons;Behavior;Disease Models, Animal;Female;GAP-43 Protein;Ganglia, Sensory;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Ligation;Macrophages;Male;Measures;Nerve Regeneration;Neuralgia;Neuroma;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Peripheral Nerves;Proteins;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Regeneration;Spinal Nerves;Sympathectomy;Work",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Neuroma;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32773603,2020,The role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in neuropathic pain.,"The chronification of pain can be attributed to changes in membrane receptors and channels underlying neuronal plasticity and signal transduction largely within nociceptive neurons that initiate and maintain pathological pain states. These proteins are subject to dynamic modification by posttranslational modifications, creating a code that controls protein function in time and space. Phosphorylation is an important posttranslational modification that affects ∼30% of proteins in vivo. Increased phosphorylation of various nociceptive ion channels and of their modulators underlies sensitization of different pain states. Cyclin-dependent kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that impact various biological and cellular systems. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), one member of this kinase family, and its activators p35 and p39 are expressed in spinal nerves, dorsal root ganglia, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In neuropathic pain conditions, expression and/or activity of Cdk5 is increased, implicating Cdk5 in nociception. Experimental evidence suggests that Cdk5 is regulated through its own phosphorylation, through increasing p35's interaction with Cdk5, and through cleavage of p35 into p25. This narrative review discusses the molecular mechanisms of Cdk5-mediated regulation of target proteins involved in neuropathic pain. We focus on Cdk5 substrates that have been linked to nociceptive pathways, including channels (eg, transient receptor potential cation channel and voltage-gated calcium channel), proteins involved in neurotransmitter release (eg, synaptophysin and collapsin response mediator protein 2), and receptors (eg, glutamate, purinergic, and opioid). By altering the phosphoregulatory ""set point"" of proteins involved in pain signaling, Cdk5 thus appears to be an attractive target for treating neuropathic pain conditions.","Affect;Biopharmaceuticals;Calcium Channels;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5;Cyclin-Dependent Kinases;Family;Ganglia, Spinal;Glutamates;Humans;Ion Channels;Membranes;Neuralgia;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurotransmitters;Nociception;Nociceptors;Opioids;Pain;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Proline;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proteins;Regulation;Review;Role;Semaphorin-3A;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Spinal Nerves;Synaptophysin;Time;Transient Receptor Potential Channels",Neuralgia;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32777329,2021,Targeting spinal neuropeptide Y1 receptor-expressing interneurons to alleviate chronic pain and itch.,"An accelerating basic science literature is providing key insights into the mechanisms by which spinal neuropeptide Y (NPY) inhibits chronic pain. A key target of pain inhibition is the Gi-coupled neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1). Y1 is located in key sites of pain transmission, including the peptidergic subpopulation of primary afferent neurons and a dense subpopulation of small, excitatory, glutamatergic/somatostatinergic interneurons (Y1-INs) that are densely expressed in the dorsal horn, particularly in superficial lamina I-II. Selective ablation of spinal Y1-INs with an NPY-conjugated saporin neurotoxin attenuates the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. Conversely, conditional knockdown of NPY expression or intrathecal administration of Y1 antagonists reinstates hypersensitivity in models of chronic latent pain sensitization. These and other results indicate that spinal NPY release and the consequent inhibition of pain facilitatory Y1-INs represent an important mechanism of endogenous analgesia. This mechanism can be mimicked with exogenous pharmacological approaches (e.g. intrathecal administration of Y1 agonists) to inhibit mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and spinal neuron activity in rodent models of neuropathic, inflammatory, and postoperative pain. Pharmacological activation of Y1 also inhibits mechanical- and histamine-induced itch. These immunohistochemical, pharmacological, and cell type-directed lesioning data, in combination with recent transcriptomic findings, point to Y1-INs as a promising therapeutic target for the development of spinally directed NPY-Y1 agonists to treat both chronic pain and itch.","Administration;Analgesia;Animals;Cells;Chronic Pain;Cold Temperature;Histamine;Hypersensitivity;Interneurons;Lamina I;Literature;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Neuropeptide Y;Neuropeptides;Neurotoxins;Neurotransmitters;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Pruritus;Receptors, Neuropeptide Y;Rodentia;Saporins;Science;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics","Chronic Pain;Hypersensitivity;Neuralgia;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Pruritus",Prog Neurobiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

33172978,2021,Legumain Induces Oral Cancer Pain by Biased Agonism of Protease-Activated Receptor-2.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most painful cancers, which interferes with orofacial function including talking and eating. We report that legumain (Lgmn) cleaves protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) in the acidic OSCC microenvironment to cause pain. Lgmn is a cysteine protease of late endosomes and lysosomes that can be secreted; it exhibits maximal activity in acidic environments. The role of Lgmn in PAR2-dependent cancer pain is unknown. We studied Lgmn activation in human oral cancers and oral cancer mouse models. Lgmn was activated in OSCC patient tumors, compared with matched normal oral tissue. After intraplantar, facial or lingual injection, Lgmn evoked nociception in wild-type (WT) female mice but not in female mice lacking PAR2 in NaV1.8-positive neurons (Par2Nav1.8), nor in female mice treated with a Lgmn inhibitor, LI-1. Inoculation of an OSCC cell line caused mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia that was reversed by LI-1. Par2Nav1.8 and Lgmn deletion attenuated mechanical allodynia in female mice with carcinogen-induced OSCC. Lgmn caused PAR2-dependent hyperexcitability of trigeminal neurons from WT female mice. Par2 deletion, LI-1, and inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase or protein kinase A (PKA) prevented the effects of Lgmn. Under acidified conditions, Lgmn cleaved within the extracellular N terminus of PAR2 at Asn30↓Arg31, proximal to the canonical trypsin activation site. Lgmn activated PAR2 by biased mechanisms in HEK293 cells to induce Ca2+ mobilization, cAMP formation, and PKA/protein kinase D (PKD) activation, but not β-arrestin recruitment or PAR2 endocytosis. Thus, in the acidified OSCC microenvironment, Lgmn activates PAR2 by biased mechanisms that evoke cancer pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most painful cancers. We report that legumain (Lgmn), which exhibits maximal activity in acidic environments, cleaves protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) on neurons to produce OSCC pain. Active Lgmn was elevated in OSCC patient tumors, compared with matched normal oral tissue. Lgmn evokes pain-like behavior through PAR2 Exposure of pain-sensing neurons to Lgmn decreased the current required to generate an action potential through PAR2 Inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA) prevented the effects of Lgmn. Lgmn activated PAR2 to induce calcium mobilization, cAMP formation, and activation of protein kinase D (PKD) and PKA, but not β-arrestin recruitment or PAR2 endocytosis. Thus, Lgmn is a biased agonist of PAR2 that evokes cancer pain.","Action Potentials;Adenosine Monophosphate;Adenylyl Cyclases;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Arrestin;Behavior;Calcium;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Cancer of Mouth;Carcinogens;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell;Cell Line;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Cysteine Endopeptidases;Cysteine Proteases;Eating;Endocytosis;Endopeptidases;Endosomes;Environment;Enzyme Activation;Exhibition;Female;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injections;Lysosomes;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Middle Aged;Mouth Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Neurons;Nociception;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Protein Kinase C;Protein Kinase Inhibitors;Protein Kinases;Receptor, PAR-2;Report;Role;Tissues;Trypsin;Tumor Microenvironment;beta-Arrestins","Cancer;Cancer Pain;Cancer of Mouth;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Mechanical Allodynia;Mouth Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain",J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33197543,2021,Key role of CCR2-expressing macrophages in a mouse model of low back pain and radiculopathy.,"Chronic low back pain is a common condition, with high societal costs and often ineffectual treatments. Communication between macrophages/monocytes (MØ) and sensory neurons has been implicated in various preclinical pain models. However, few studies have examined specific MØ subsets, although distinct subtypes may play opposing roles. This study used a model of low back pain/radiculopathy involving direct local inflammation of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Reporter mice were employed that had distinct fluorescent labels for two key MØ subsets: CCR2-expressing (infiltrating pro-inflammatory) MØ, and CX3CR1-expressing (resident) macrophages. We observed that local DRG inflammation induced pain behaviors in mice, including guarding behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity, similar to the previously described rat model. The increase in MØ in the inflamed DRG was dominated by increases in CCR2+ MØ, which persisted for at least 14 days. The primary endogenous ligand for CCR2, CCL2, was upregulated in inflamed DRG. Three different experimental manipulations that reduced the CCR2+ MØ influx also reduced pain behaviors: global CCR2 knockout; systemic injection of INCB3344 (specific CCR2 blocker); and intravenous injection of liposomal clodronate. The latter two treatments when applied around the time of DRG inflammation reduced CCR2+ but not CX3CR1+ MØ in the DRG. Together these experiments suggest a key role for the CCR2/CCL2 system in establishing the pain state in this model of inflammatory low back pain and radiculopathy. Intravenous clodronate given after pain was established had the opposite effect on pain behaviors, suggesting the role of macrophages or their susceptibility to clodronate may change with time.","Animals;Behavior;CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1;Chemokine CCL2;Clodronate;Clodronic Acid;Communication;Cost;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injections;Injections, Intravenous;Ligands;Low Back Pain;Macrophages;Mice;Monocytes;Pain;Play;Radiculopathy;Rats;Receptors, CCR2;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Therapeutics;Time",Ganglion Cysts;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Low Back Pain;Pain;Radiculopathy,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33239404,2021,The Neuroimmunology of Chronic Pain: From Rodents to Humans.,"Chronic pain, encompassing conditions, such as low back pain, arthritis, persistent post-surgical pain, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain disorders, is highly prevalent but remains poorly treated. The vast majority of therapeutics are directed solely at neurons, despite the fact that signaling between immune cells, glia, and neurons is now recognized as indispensable for the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain. This review highlights recent advances in understanding fundamental neuroimmune signaling mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets in rodent models of chronic pain. We further discuss new technological developments to study, diagnose, and quantify neuroimmune contributions to chronic pain in patient populations.","Animals;Arthritis;Autoantibodies;Biomarkers;Cannabinoids;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Diagnosis;Disease Models, Animal;Fibromyalgia;Humans;Low Back Pain;Maintenance;NF-E2-Related Factor 2;Neuralgia;Neuroglia;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neurons;News;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Population;Receptors, IgG;Review;Rodentia;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics","Arthritis;Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia;Low Back Pain;Neuralgia;Pain, Postoperative",J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33259455,2021,C5a complement and cytokine signaling mediate the pronociceptive effects of complex regional pain syndrome patient IgM in fracture mice.,"It has been proposed that complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a posttraumatic autoimmune disease. Previously, we observed that B cells contribute to CRPS-like changes in a mouse tibia fracture model, and that early (&lt;12 months duration) CRPS patient IgM antibodies have pronociceptive effects in the skin and spinal cord of muMT fracture mice lacking B cells. The current study evaluated the pronociceptive effects of intraplantar or intrathecal injections of early CRPS IgM (5 µg) in muMT fracture mice. Skin and lumbar spinal cord were collected for immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction analyses. Wild-type mice exhibited postfracture increases in complement component C5a and its receptor expression in skin and spinal cord, predominantly on dermal macrophages and spinal microglia. Intraplantar IgM injection caused nociceptive sensitization in muMT fracture mice with increased complement component C1q and inflammatory cytokine expression, and these IgM effects were blocked by a C5a receptor antagonist (PMX53) or a global cytokine inhibitor (pentoxifylline). Intrathecal IgM injection also had pronociceptive effects with increased spinal cytokine expression, effects that were blocked by PMX53 or pentoxifylline treatment. Intrathecal injection of chronic (&gt;12 months duration) CRPS patient IgM (but not IgG) caused nociceptive sensitization in muMT fracture mice, but intraplantar injection of chronic CRPS IgM or IgG had no effect. We postulate that CRPS IgM antibodies bind to neoantigens in the fracture limb skin and corresponding spinal cord to activate C5a complement signaling in macrophages and microglia, evoking proinflammatory cytokine expression contributing to nociceptive sensitization in the injured limb.","Animals;Autoimmune Diseases;B-Lymphocytes;Complement C5a;Complement System Proteins;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Cytokines;Disease Models, Animal;Extremities;Humans;Immunoglobulin G;Immunoglobulin M;Immunohistochemistry;Injections;Injections, Intrathecal;Macrophages;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Patients;Pentoxifylline;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a;Skin;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics;Tibia",Autoimmune Diseases;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33272979,2021,Targeting G protein-coupled receptors for the treatment of chronic pain in the digestive system.,"Chronic pain is a hallmark of functional disorders, inflammatory diseases and cancer of the digestive system. The mechanisms that initiate and sustain chronic pain are incompletely understood, and available therapies are inadequate. This review highlights recent advances in the structure and function of pronociceptive and antinociceptive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that provide insights into the mechanisms and treatment of chronic pain. This knowledge, derived from studies of somatic pain, can guide research into visceral pain. Mediators from injured tissues transiently activate GPCRs at the plasma membrane of neurons, leading to sensitisation of ion channels and acute hyperexcitability and nociception. Sustained agonist release evokes GPCR redistribution to endosomes, where persistent signalling regulates activity of channels and genes that control chronic hyperexcitability and nociception. Endosomally targeted GPCR antagonists provide superior pain relief in preclinical models. Biased agonists stabilise GPCR conformations that favour signalling of beneficial actions at the expense of detrimental side effects. Biased agonists of µ-opioid receptors (MOPrs) can provide analgesia without addiction, respiratory depression and constipation. Opioids that preferentially bind to MOPrs in the acidic microenvironment of diseased tissues produce analgesia without side effects. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs fine-tune actions of endogenous ligands, offering the prospect of refined pain control. GPCR dimers might function as distinct therapeutic targets for nociception. The discovery that GPCRs that control itch also mediate irritant sensation in the colon has revealed new targets. A deeper understanding of GPCR structure and function in different microenvironments offers the potential of developing superior treatments for GI pain.","Abdominal Pain;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Cancer of Digestive System;Cell Membrane;Chronic Pain;Colon;Comprehension;Constipation;Digestive System;Disease;Endosomes;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Genes;Humans;Ion Channels;Irritants;Knowledge;Ligands;Neurobiology;Neurons;News;Nociception;Opioids;Pain;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Research;Respiratory Depression;Review;Sensation;Sensory System Agents;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics;Tissue Pain;Tissues;Viscera;Visceral Pain",Abdominal Pain;Cancer of Digestive System;Chronic Pain;Constipation;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Pain;Respiratory Depression;Tissue Pain;Visceral Pain,Gut,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33316379,2021,Nasal administration of mesenchymal stem cells reverses chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in mice.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequently reported adverse effects of cancer treatment. CIPN often persists long after treatment completion and has detrimental effects on patient's quality of life. There are no efficacious FDA-approved drugs for CIPN. We recently demonstrated that nasal administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reverses the cognitive deficits induced by cisplatin in mice. Here we show that nasal administration of MSC after cisplatin- or paclitaxel treatment- completely reverses signs of established CIPN, including mechanical allodynia, spontaneous pain, and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) in the paw. The resolution of CIPN is associated with normalization of the cisplatin-induced decrease in mitochondrial bioenergetics in DRG neurons. Nasally administered MSC enter rapidly the meninges of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral lymph nodes to promote IL-10 production by macrophages. MSC-mediated resolution of mechanical allodynia, recovery of IENFs and restoration of DRG mitochondrial function critically depends on IL-10 production. MSC from IL-10 knockout animals are not capable of reversing the symptoms of CIPN. Moreover, WT MSC do not reverse CIPN in mice lacking IL-10 receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. In conclusion, only two nasal administrations of MSC fully reverse CIPN and the associated mitochondrial abnormalities via an IL-10 dependent pathway. Since MSC are already applied clinically, we propose that nasal MSC treatment could become a powerful treatment for the large group of patients suffering from neurotoxicities of cancer treatment.","Administration, Intranasal;Aftercare;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Bioenergetics;Brain;Cancer;Cisplatin;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Drug Therapy;Humans;Interleukin-10;Lymph Nodes;Macrophages;Mechanical Allodynia;Meninges;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Mice;Mitochondria;Nerve Fibers;Neurons;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Production;Quality of Life;Receptors, Interleukin-10;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics",Cancer;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33340498,2021,Nerve trauma-caused downregulation of opioid receptors in primary afferent neurons: Molecular mechanisms and potential managements.,"Neuropathic pain is the most common clinical disorder destroying the quality of patient life and leading to a marked economic and social burden. Opioids are still last option for pharmacological treatment of this disorder, but their antinociceptive effects are limited in part due to the downregulation of opioid receptors in the primary afferent neurons after peripheral nerve trauma. How this downregulation occurs is not completely understood, but recent studies have demonstrated that peripheral nerve trauma drives the alterations in epigenetic modifications (including DNA methylation, histone methylation and mciroRNAs), expression of transcription factors, post-transcriptional modifications (e.g., RNA methylation) and protein translation initiation in the neurons of nerve trauma-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and that these alternations may be associated with nerve trauma-caused downregulation of DRG opioid receptors. This review presents how opioid receptors are downregulated in the DRG after peripheral nerve trauma, specifically focusing on distinct molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional and translational processes. This review also discusses how this downregulation contributes to the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain. A deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms likely provides a novel avenue for prevention and/or treatment of neuropathic pain.","Animals;Comprehension;DNA Methylation;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Down-Regulation;Drive;Economics;Epigenetics;Ganglia, Spinal;Histones;Humans;Life;Maintenance;Methylation;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Opioids;Patients;Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Peripheral Nerves;RNA;RNA, Guide;Receptors, Opioid;Review;Therapeutics;Transcription Factors;Wounds and Injuries",Ganglion Cysts;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Wounds and Injuries,Exp Neurol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

The contribution of neuroinflammation to chronic pain is widely acknowledged. Here, we summarize findings indicating that T cells play a key role in the suppression of pain. An active contribution of the immune system to resolution of pain may explain why immunosuppressive drugs are often not sufficient to control pain. This would also imply that dysregulation of certain immune functions promote transition to chronic pain. Conversely, stimulating the endogenous immune-mediated resolution pathways may provide a potent approach to treat chronic pain.",Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Disease;Humans;Immune System;Pain;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Research;Role;T-Lymphocytes;Therapeutics,Chronic Pain;Pain,Trends Mol Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33478555,2021,"Non-SUMOylated CRMP2 decreases NaV1.7 currents via the endocytic proteins Numb, Nedd4-2 and Eps15.","Voltage-gated sodium channels are key players in neuronal excitability and pain signaling. Functional expression of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is under the control of SUMOylated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). When not SUMOylated, CRMP2 forms a complex with the endocytic proteins Numb, the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NaV1.7. We recently reported that CRMP2 SUMO-null knock-in (CRMP2K374A/K374A) female mice have reduced NaV1.7 membrane localization and currents in their sensory neurons. Preventing CRMP2 SUMOylation was sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in CRMP2K374A/K374A female mice with neuropathic pain. Here we report that inhibiting clathrin assembly in nerve-injured male CRMP2K374A/K374A mice precipitated mechanical allodynia in mice otherwise resistant to developing persistent pain. Furthermore, Numb, Nedd4-2 and Eps15 expression was not modified in basal conditions in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male and female CRMP2K374A/K374A mice. Finally, silencing these proteins in DRG neurons from female CRMP2K374A/K374A mice, restored the loss of sodium currents. Our study shows that the endocytic complex composed of Numb, Nedd4-2 and Eps15, is necessary for non-SUMOylated CRMP2-mediated internalization of sodium channels in vivo.","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing;Animals;Clathrin;Diagnosis-Related Groups;EGF Receptors;Endocytosis;Female;Form;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Silencing;Hyperalgesia;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Ion Channel Gating;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Membrane Proteins;Membranes;Mice;Models, Biological;NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Neuralgia;Neurons;Pain;Proteins;Report;Semaphorin-3A;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sodium;Sodium Channels;Spinal Nerves;Sulfonamides;Sumoylation;Thiazolidines;Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels",Hyperalgesia;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain,Mol Brain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33478988,2021,TRPM3 Channels Play Roles in Heat Hypersensitivity and Spontaneous Pain after Nerve Injury.,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a heat-activated ion channel in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Pharmacological and genetic studies implicated TRPM3 in various pain modalities, but TRPM3 inhibitors were not validated in TRPM3-/- mice. Here we tested two inhibitors of TRPM3 in male and female wild-type and TRPM3-/- mice in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. We found that intraperitoneal injection of either isosakuranetin or primidone reduced heat hypersensitivity induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in wild-type, but not in TRPM3-/- mice. Primidone was also effective when injected locally in the hindpaw or intrathecally. Consistently, intrathecal injection of the TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 reduced paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat in wild-type, but not in TRPM3-/- mice. Intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg isosakuranetin, inhibited cold and mechanical hypersensitivity in CCI, both in wild-type and TRPM3-/- mice, indicating a dose-dependent off-target effect. Primidone had no effect on cold sensitivity, and only a marginal effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. Genetic deletion or inhibitors of TRPM3 reduced the increase in the levels of the early genes c-Fos and pERK in the spinal cord and DRGs in CCI mice, suggesting spontaneous activity of the channel. Intraperitoneal isosakuranetin also inhibited spontaneous pain related behavior in CCI in the conditioned place preference assay, and this effect was eliminated in TRPM3-/- mice. Overall, our data indicate a role of TRPM3 in heat hypersensitivity and in spontaneous pain after nerve injury.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuropathic pain is a major unsolved medical problem. The heat-activated TRPM3 ion channel is a potential target for novel pain medications, but the pain modalities in which it plays a role are not clear. Here we used a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools to assess the role of this channel in spontaneous pain, heat, cold, and mechanical hypersensitivity in a nerve injury model of neuropathic pain in mice. Our findings indicate a role for TRPM3 in heat hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain, but not in cold and mechanical hypersensitivity. We also find that not only TRPM3 located in the peripheral nerve termini, but also TRPM3 in the spinal cord or proximal segments of DRG neurons are important for heat hypersensitivity.","Animals;Behavior;Cold Temperature;Constriction;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Genetics;Heat;Hot Temperature;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Injections, Intrathecal;Injuries;Ion Channels;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Neuralgia;Neurons;Overall;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Peripheral Nerves;Play;Primidone;Role;Sciatic Nerve;Sensitivity;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;TRPM Cation Channels;Transients",Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Despite the existence of a large body of information on the subject, the molecular underpinnings of orofacial pain remain elusive. Two decades of research has identified that transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels play a crucial role in pathological pain. A number of TRP ion channels are clearly expressed in the trigeminal sensory system and have critical functions in the transduction and pathogenesis of orofacial pain. Although there are many similarities, the orofacial sensory system shows some distinct peripheral and central pain processing and different sensitivities from the spinal sensory system. Relative to the extensive review on TRPs in spinally-mediated pain, the summary of TRPs in trigeminally-mediated pain has not been well-documented. This review focuses on the current experimental evidence involving TRP ion channels, particularly TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPV4, and TRPM8 in orofacial pain, and discusses their possible cellular and molecular mechanisms.",Affect;Animals;Facial Pain;Headache;Humans;Ion Channels;Neuralgia;Orofacial Pain;Pain;Play;Population Health;Relatives;Research;Review;Role;Sensitivity;Sensory Receptor Cells;Temporomandibular Joint;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Transients;Trigeminal Ganglion;Trigeminal Neuralgia,Arthralgia;Facial Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Headache;Neuralgia;Orofacial Pain;Pain;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Trigeminal Neuralgia,Mol Neurobiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33515548,2021,A lipid-anchored neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist prolongs pain relief by a three-pronged mechanism of action targeting the receptor at the plasma membrane and in endosomes.,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are traditionally known for signaling at the plasma membrane, but they can also signal from endosomes after internalization to control important pathophysiological processes. In spinal neurons, sustained endosomal signaling of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) mediates nociception, as demonstrated in models of acute and neuropathic pain. An NK1R antagonist, Spantide I (Span), conjugated to cholestanol (Span-Chol), accumulates in endosomes, inhibits endosomal NK1R signaling, and causes prolonged antinociception. However, the extent to which the Chol-anchor influences long-term location and activity is poorly understood. Herein, we used fluorescent correlation spectroscopy and targeted biosensors to characterize Span-Chol over time. The Chol-anchor increased local concentration of probe at the plasma membrane. Over time we observed an increase in NK1R-binding affinity and more potent inhibition of NK1R-mediated calcium signaling. Span-Chol, but not Span, caused a persistent decrease in NK1R recruitment of β-arrestin and receptor internalization to early endosomes. Using targeted biosensors, we mapped the relative inhibition of NK1R signaling as the receptor moved into the cell. Span selectively inhibited cell surface signaling, whereas Span-Chol partitioned into endosomal membranes and blocked endosomal signaling. In a preclinical model of pain, Span-Chol caused prolonged antinociception (&gt;9 h), which is attributable to a three-pronged mechanism of action: increased local concentration at membranes, a prolonged decrease in NK1R endocytosis, and persistent inhibition of signaling from endosomes. Identifying the mechanisms that contribute to the increased preclinical efficacy of lipid-anchored NK1R antagonists is an important step toward understanding how we can effectively target intracellular GPCRs in disease.","Analgesics;Animals;Biosensors;Calcium Signaling;Cell Membrane;Cells;Cholestanol;Comprehension;Disease;Endocytosis;Endosomes;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Lipids;Male;Membranes;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neuralgia;Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists;Neurons;Nociception;Pain;Pain Management;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Neurokinin-1;Relatives;Signal Transduction;Spectroscopy;Substance P;Tachykinins;Time;beta-Arrestins",Neuralgia;Pain,J Biol Chem,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33636311,2021,"IL-6 signaling mediates the germinal center response, IgM production and nociceptive sensitization in male mice after tibia fracture.","Up-regulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, immune system activation, and pronociceptive autoantibodies are characteristic of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). IL-6 is known to promote B cell differentiation, thus we hypothesized that IL-6 signaling plays a crucial role in the development of adaptive immune responses and nociceptive sensitization in a murine tibia fracture model of CRPS. Mice deficient in IL-6 expression (IL-6-/-) or B cell deficient (muMT) underwent tibia fracture and 3 weeks of cast immobilization or sham injury. The deposition of IgM in fractured limbs was followed using Western blotting, and passive serum transfer to muMT fracture mice was used to detect nociception-supporting autoantibodies. Lymph nodes were assessed for hypertrophy, IL-6 expression was measured using qPCR and ELISA, and germinal center formation was evaluated using FACS and immunohistochemistry. The therapeutic effects of exogenous neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibodies were also evaluated in the CRPS fracture model. Functional IL-6 signaling was required for the post fracture development of nociceptive sensitization, vascular changes, and IgM immune complex deposition in the skin of injured limbs. Passive transfer of sera from wild-type, but not IL-6-/- fracture mice into muMT fracture mice caused enhanced allodynia and postural unweighting. IL-6-/- fracture mice displayed reduced popliteal lymphadenopathy after fracture. Germinal center responses were detected in the popliteal lymph nodes of wild-type, but not in IL-6-/- fracture mice. We observed that IL-6 expression was dramatically enhanced in popliteal lymph node tissue after fracture. Conversely, administration of anti-IL-6 antibodies reduced nociceptive and vascular changes after fracture and inhibited lymphadenopathy. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that IL-6 signaling in the fracture limb of mice is required for germinal center formation, IgM autoantibody production and nociceptive sensitization. Anti-IL-6 therapies might, therefore, reduce pain after limb fracture or in the setting of CRPS.","Adaptive Immune Response;Administration;Allodynia;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Autoantibodies;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;Blotting, Western;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Disease Models, Animal;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Extremities;Germinal Center;Hypertrophy;Immobilization;Immune System;Immunoglobulin M;Immunohistochemistry;Injuries;Interleukin-6;Lymph Nodes;Lymphadenopathy;Male;Mice;Nociception;Pain;Play;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Production;Role;Serum;Skin;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics;Tibia;Tissues",Allodynia;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Hypertrophy;Injuries;Lymphadenopathy;Pain,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33636371,2021,Mechanisms and Pathways of Pain Photobiomodulation: A Narrative Review.,"A growing body of evidence supports the modulation of pain by light exposure. As such, phototherapy is being increasingly utilized for the management of a variety of pain conditions. The modes of delivery, and hence applications of phototherapy, vary by wavelength, intensity, and route of exposure. As such, differing mechanisms of action exist depending upon those parameters. Cutaneous application of red light (660 nm) has been shown to reduce pain in neuropathies and complex regional pain syndrome-I, whereas visual application of the same wavelength of red light has been reported to exacerbate migraine headache in patients and lead to the development of functional pain in animal models. Interestingly visual exposure to green light can result in reduction in pain in variety of pain conditions such as migraine and fibromyalgia. Cutaneous application typically requires exposure on the order of minutes, whereas visual application requires exposure on the order of hours. Both routes of exposure elicit changes centrally in the brainstem and spinal cord, and peripherally in the dorsal root ganglia and nociceptors. The mechanisms of photobiomodulation of pain presented in this review provide a foundation in furtherance of exploration of the utility of phototherapy as a tool in the management of pain. PERSPECTIVE: This review synopsizes the pathways and mechanisms through which light modulates pain and the therapeutic utility of different colors and exposure modalities of light on pain. Recent advances in photobiomodulation provide a foundation for understanding this novel treatment for pain on which future translational and clinical studies can build upon.","Brain Stem;Clinical Study;Color;Complementary Medicine;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Comprehension;Fibromyalgia;Foundations;Future;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Lead;Light;Light Signal Transduction;Methyl Green;Migraine Disorders;Models, Animal;Neural Pathways;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Phototherapy;Review;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics",Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Fibromyalgia;Migraine Disorders;Pain,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33646122,2021,Parathyroid hormone attenuates osteoarthritis pain by remodeling subchondral bone in mice.,"Osteoarthritis, a highly prevalent degenerative joint disorder, is characterized by joint pain and disability. Available treatments fail to modify osteoarthritis progression and decrease joint pain effectively. Here, we show that intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) attenuates osteoarthritis pain by inhibiting subchondral sensory innervation, subchondral bone deterioration, and articular cartilage degeneration in a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. We found that subchondral sensory innervation for osteoarthritis pain was significantly decreased in PTH-treated DMM mice compared with vehicle-treated DMM mice. In parallel, deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in DMM mice was attenuated by iPTH treatment. Increased level of prostaglandin E2 in subchondral bone of DMM mice was reduced by iPTH treatment. Furthermore, uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling caused by increased transforming growth factor β signaling was regulated by PTH-induced endocytosis of the PTH type 1 receptor-transforming growth factor β type 2 receptor complex. Notably, iPTH improved subchondral bone microarchitecture and decreased level of prostaglandin E2 and sensory innervation of subchondral bone in DMM mice by acting specifically through PTH type 1 receptor in Nestin+ mesenchymal stromal cells. Thus, iPTH could be a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis.","Animals;Arthralgia;Bone Remodeling;Bone and Bones;Bones;Cartilage, Articular;Dinoprostone;Disease;Disease Models, Animal;Endocytosis;Hindlimb;Joints;Male;Medial Menisci;Medicine;Meniscus;Mesenchymal Stromal Cells;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Transgenic;Nestin;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Parathyroid Hormone;Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta;Therapeutics;Transforming Growth Factor beta",Arthralgia;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Elife,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33646995,2021,Dimethyl Fumarate Reduces Oxidative Stress and Pronociceptive Immune Responses in a Murine Model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly disabling cause of pain often precipitated by surgery or trauma to a limb. Both innate and adaptive immunological changes contribute to this syndrome. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) works through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor and other targets to activate antioxidant systems and to suppress immune system activation. We hypothesized that DMF would reduce nociceptive, functional, and immunological changes measured in a model of CRPS. Male C57BL/6 mice were used in the well-characterized tibial fracture model of CRPS. Some groups of mice received DMF 25 mg/kg/d orally, per os for 3 weeks after fracture versus vehicle alone. Homozygous Nrf2 null mutant mice were used as test subjects to address the need for this transcription factor for DMF activity. Allodynia was assessed using von Frey filaments and hindlimb weight-bearing data were collected. The markers of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were quantified in the skin of the fractured mice using immunoassays along with the innate immune system cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. The accumulation of IgM in the fractured limbs and lymph node hypertrophy were used as indexes of adaptive immune system activation, and the passive transfer of serum from wildtype fractured mice to B cell-deficient fractured muMT mice (mice lacking B cells and immunoglobulin) helped to assess the pronociceptive activity of humoral factors. We observed that oral DMF administration strongly prevented nociceptive sensitization and reduced uneven hindlimb weight bearing after fracture. DMF was also very effective in reducing the accumulation of markers of oxidative stress, activation of innate immune mediator production, lymph node hypertrophy, and the accumulation of IgM in fractured limbs. The sera of fractured vehicle-treated but not DMF-treated mice conferred pronociceptive activity to recipient mice. Unexpectedly, the effects of DMF were largely unchanged in the Nrf2 null mutant mice. Oxidative stress and immune system activation are robust after hindlimb fracture in mice. DMF strongly reduces activation of those systems, and the Nrf2 transcription factor is not required. DMF or drugs working through similar mechanisms might provide effective therapy for CRPS or other conditions where oxidative stress causes immune system activation.","Adaptive Immunity;Address;Administration;Allodynia;Analgesics;Animals;Antioxidants;B-Lymphocytes;Biomarkers;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Cytokines;Dimethyl Fumarate;Disease Models, Animal;Extremities;General Surgery;Hindlimb;Hypertrophy;Immune System;Immunity;Immunity, Innate;Immunoassay;Immunoglobulin M;Immunoglobulins;Immunosuppressive Agents;Index;Interleukin-1beta;Interleukin-6;Lymph Nodes;Male;Malondialdehyde;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;NF-E2-Related Factor 2;Needs;Nociception;Oxidative Stress;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Production;Serum;Skin;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Tibial Fractures;Transcription Factors;Weight-Bearing;Work;Wounds and Injuries",Allodynia;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Hypertrophy;Pain;Syndrome;Tibial Fractures;Wounds and Injuries,Anesth Analg,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33692134,2021,Long-lasting analgesia via targeted in situ repression of NaV1.7 in mice.,"Current treatments for chronic pain rely largely on opioids despite their substantial side effects and risk of addiction. Genetic studies have identified in humans key targets pivotal to nociceptive processing. In particular, a hereditary loss-of-function mutation in NaV1.7, a sodium channel protein associated with signaling in nociceptive sensory afferents, leads to insensitivity to pain without other neurodevelopmental alterations. However, the high sequence and structural similarity between NaV subtypes has frustrated efforts to develop selective inhibitors. Here, we investigated targeted epigenetic repression of NaV1.7 in primary afferents via epigenome engineering approaches based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dCas9 and zinc finger proteins at the spinal level as a potential treatment for chronic pain. Toward this end, we first optimized the efficiency of NaV1.7 repression in vitro in Neuro2A cells and then, by the lumbar intrathecal route, delivered both epigenome engineering platforms via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to assess their effects in three mouse models of pain: carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain, paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, and BzATP-induced pain. Our results show effective repression of NaV1.7 in lumbar dorsal root ganglia, reduced thermal hyperalgesia in the inflammatory state, decreased tactile allodynia in the neuropathic state, and no changes in normal motor function in mice. We anticipate that this long-lasting analgesia via targeted in vivo epigenetic repression of NaV1.7 methodology we dub pain LATER, might have therapeutic potential in management of persistent pain states.","Adeno-Associated Virus;Adenosine Triphosphate;Analgesia;Animals;Carrageenan;Cells;Chronic Pain;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Efficiency;Engineering;Epigenetic Repression;Epigenome;Ganglia, Spinal;Genetics;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;In Vitro;Lead;Loss of Function Mutation;Mice;Neuralgia;Opioids;Paclitaxel;Pain;Proteins;Risk;Sodium Channels;Tactile Allodynia;Therapeutics;Zinc Fingers","Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Neuralgia;Pain;Tactile Allodynia",Sci Transl Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33705816,2021,"Past, present and future of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide.","The existence of the peptide encoded by the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (Cartpt) has been recognized since 1981, but it was not until 1995, that the gene encoding CART peptide (CART) was identified. With the availability of the predicted protein sequence of CART investigators were able to identify sites of peptide localization, which then led to numerous approaches attempting to clarify CART's multiple pharmacologic effects and even provide evidence of potential physiologic relevance. Although not without controversy, a picture emerged of the importance of CART in ingestive behaviors, reward behaviors and even pain sensation. Despite the wealth of data hinting at the significance of CART, in the absence of an identified receptor, the full potential for this peptide or its analogs to be developed into therapeutic agents remained unrealized. There was evidence favoring the action of CART via a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), but despite multiple attempts the identity of that receptor eluded investigators until recently. Now with the identification of the previously orphaned GPCR, GPR160, as a receptor for CART, focus on this pluripotent neuropeptide will in all likelihood experience a renaissance and the potential for the development of pharmcotherapies targeting GPR160 seems within reach.","Amphetamine;Behavior;Cocaine;Feeding Behavior;Future;Genes;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Neuropeptides;Pain;Peptides;Proteins;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Research Personnel;Reward;Sensation;Therapeutics",Pain,Physiol Behav,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33771895,2021,Peripheral Nerve Resident Macrophages and Schwann Cells Mediate Cancer-Induced Pain.,"Although macrophages (MΦ) are known to play a central role in neuropathic pain, their contribution to cancer pain has not been established. Here we report that depletion of sciatic nerve resident MΦs (rMΦ) in mice attenuates mechanical/cold hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain evoked by intraplantar injection of melanoma or lung carcinoma cells. MΦ-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) was upregulated in the sciatic nerve trunk and mediated cancer-evoked pain via rMΦ expansion, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) activation, and oxidative stress. Targeted deletion of Trpa1 revealed a key role for Schwann cell TRPA1 in sciatic nerve rMΦ expansion and pain-like behaviors. Depletion of rMΦs in a medial portion of the sciatic nerve prevented pain-like behaviors. Collectively, we identified a feed-forward pathway involving M-CSF, rMΦ, oxidative stress, and Schwann cell TRPA1 that operates throughout the nerve trunk to signal cancer-evoked pain. SIGNIFICANCE: Schwann cell TRPA1 sustains cancer pain through release of M-CSF and oxidative stress, which promote the expansion and the proalgesic actions of intraneural macrophages.

33785555,2022,Agonist that activates the µ-opioid receptor in acidified microenvironments inhibits colitis pain without side effects.,"The effectiveness of µ-opioid receptor (MOPr) agonists for treatment of visceral pain is compromised by constipation, respiratory depression, sedation and addiction. We investigated whether a fentanyl analogue, (±)-N-(3-fluoro-1-phenethylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-phenyl propionamide (NFEPP), which preferentially activates MOPr in acidified diseased tissues, would inhibit pain in a preclinical model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) without side effects in healthy tissues. Antinociceptive actions of NFEPP and fentanyl were compared in control mice and mice with dextran sodium sulfate colitis by measuring visceromotor responses to colorectal distension. Patch clamp and extracellular recordings were used to assess nociceptor activation. Defecation, respiration and locomotion were assessed. Colonic migrating motor complexes were assessed by spatiotemporal mapping of isolated tissue. NFEPP-induced MOPr signalling and trafficking were studied in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. NFEPP inhibited visceromotor responses to colorectal distension in mice with colitis but not in control mice, consistent with acidification of the inflamed colon. Fentanyl inhibited responses in both groups. NFEPP inhibited the excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons and suppressed mechanical sensitivity of colonic afferent fibres in acidified but not physiological conditions. Whereas fentanyl decreased defecation and caused respiratory depression and hyperactivity in mice with colitis, NFEPP was devoid of these effects. NFEPP did not affect colonic migrating motor complexes at physiological pH. NFEPP preferentially activated MOPr in acidified extracellular conditions to inhibit cAMP formation, recruit β-arrestins and evoke MOPr endocytosis. In a preclinical IBD model, NFEPP preferentially activates MOPr in acidified microenvironments of inflamed tissues to induce antinociception without causing respiratory depression, constipation and hyperactivity.","Abdominal Pain;Adenosine Monophosphate;Affect;Animals;Cells;Colitis;Colon;Colorectal Neoplasms;Constipation;Defecation;Dextran;Endocytosis;Fentanyl;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Kidney;Locomotion;Mice;Myoelectric Complex, Migrating;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiration;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Sensitivity;Sodium;Sulfates;Therapeutics;Tissues;Tumor Microenvironment;Visceral Pain;beta-Arrestins",Abdominal Pain;Colitis;Colorectal Neoplasms;Constipation;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Neoplasms;Pain;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Visceral Pain,Gut,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33854366,2021,Low-Dose Interleukin-2 and Regulatory T Cell Treatments Attenuate Punctate and Dynamic Mechanical Allodynia in a Mouse Model of Sciatic Nerve Injury.,"Nerve injury-induced mechanical hyper-sensitivity, in particular stroking-induced dynamic allodynia, is highly debilitating and difficult to treat. Previous studies indicate that the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells modulate the magnitude of punctate mechanical allodynia resulting from sciatic nerve injury. However, whether enhancing Treg-mediated suppression attenuates dynamic allodynia is not known. In the present study, we addressed this knowledge gap by treating mice with low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL2) injections or adoptive transfer of Treg cells. Female Swiss Webster mice received daily injections of ld-IL2 (1 μg/mouse, intraperitoneally) either before or after unilateral spared nerve injury (SNI). Male C57BL/6J mice received adoptive transfer of 1 x 106 Treg cells 3 weeks post-SNI. The responses to punctate and dynamic mechanical stimuli on the hindpaw were monitored before and up to 4-6 weeks post-SNI. We also compared the distribution of Treg cells and CD3+ total T cells after SNI and/or ld-IL2 treatment. Ld-IL2 pretreatment in female Swiss Webster mice completely blocked the development of SNI-induced dynamic mechanical allodynia and reduced the magnitude of punctate allodynia. Delayed ld-IL2 treatment in female mice significantly attenuated the morphine-resistant punctate and dynamic allodynia at 3-5 weeks post-SNI. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells to male C57BL/6J mice 3 weeks post-SNI effectively reversed the persistent punctate and dynamic allodynia, supporting that the effect of ld-IL2 is mediated through endogenous Treg cells, and is likely independent of mouse strain and sex. Neither ld-IL2 treatment nor Treg transfer affected the basal responses to punctate or brush stimuli. Ld-IL2 significantly increased the frequency of Treg cells among total CD3+ T cells in the injured sciatic nerves but not in the uninjured nerves or the dorsal root ganglia, suggesting the injured nerve as ld-IL2's site of action. Collectively, results from the present study supports Treg as a cellular target and ld-IL2 as a potential therapeutic option for nerve injury-induced persistent punctate and dynamic mechanical allodynia.","Adoptive Transfer;Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Injections;Injuries;Interleukin-2;Knowledge;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Morphine;Sciatic Nerve;Sensitivity;Sex;T-Lymphocytes;T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory;Therapeutics",Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia,J Pain Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33941753,2022,Sympathectomy decreases pain behaviors and nerve regeneration by downregulating monocyte chemokine CCL2 in dorsal root ganglia in the rat tibial nerve crush model.,"Peripheral nerve regeneration is associated with pain in several preclinical models of neuropathic pain. Some neuropathic pain conditions and preclinical neuropathic pain behaviors are improved by sympathetic blockade. In this study, we examined the effect of a localized ""microsympathectomy,"" ie, cutting the gray rami containing sympathetic postganglionic axons where they enter the L4 and L5 spinal nerves, which is more analogous to clinically used sympathetic blockade compared with chemical or surgical sympathectomy. We also examined manipulations of CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), a key player in both regeneration and pain. We used rat tibial nerve crush as a neuropathic pain model in which peripheral nerve regeneration can occur successfully. CCL2 in the sensory ganglia was increased by tibial nerve crush and reduced by microsympathectomy. Microsympathectomy and localized siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCL2 in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion had very similar effects: partial improvement of mechanical hypersensitivity and guarding behavior, reduction of regeneration markers growth-associated protein 43 and activating transcription factor 3, and reduction of macrophage density in the sensory ganglia and regenerating nerve. Microsympathectomy reduced functional regeneration as measured by myelinated action potential propagation through the injury site and denervation-induced atrophy of the tibial-innervated gastrocnemius muscle at day 10. Microsympathectomy plus CCL2 knockdown had behavioral effects similar to microsympathectomy alone. The results show that local sympathetic effects on neuropathic pain may be mediated in a large part by the effects on expression of CCL2, which in turn regulates the regeneration process.","Action Potentials;Activating Transcription Factor 3;Animals;Atrophy;Axons;Behavior;Chemokine CCL2;Denervation;GAP-43 Protein;Ganglia, Sensory;Ganglia, Spinal;Gastrocnemius Muscle;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Macrophages;Monocytes;Nerve Regeneration;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerves;RNA, Small Interfering;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Regeneration;Spinal Nerves;Sympathectomy;Tibial Nerve",Atrophy;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

33970188,2021,Normalization of cholesterol metabolism in spinal microglia alleviates neuropathic pain.,"Neuroinflammation is a major component in the transition to and perpetuation of neuropathic pain states. Spinal neuroinflammation involves activation of TLR4, localized to enlarged, cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, designated here as inflammarafts. Conditional deletion of cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in microglia, leading to inflammaraft formation, induced tactile allodynia in naive mice. The apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) facilitated cholesterol depletion from inflammarafts and reversed neuropathic pain in a model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in wild-type mice, but AIBP failed to reverse allodynia in mice with ABCA1/ABCG1-deficient microglia, suggesting a cholesterol-dependent mechanism. An AIBP mutant lacking the TLR4-binding domain did not bind microglia or reverse CIPN allodynia. The long-lasting therapeutic effect of a single AIBP dose in CIPN was associated with anti-inflammatory and cholesterol metabolism reprogramming and reduced accumulation of lipid droplets in microglia. These results suggest a cholesterol-driven mechanism of regulation of neuropathic pain by controlling the TLR4 inflammarafts and gene expression program in microglia and blocking the perpetuation of neuroinflammation.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily A;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1;Allodynia;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Apolipoprotein A-I;Binding Proteins;Biological Transport;Cell Line;Cholesterol;Drug Therapy;Gene Expression;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Inflammation;Lipid Droplets;Lipids;Male;Membrane Microdomains;Metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Program;Regulation;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Tactile Allodynia;Therapeutic Effects",Allodynia;Inflammation;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Tactile Allodynia,J Exp Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

34102854,2021,FTO (Fat-Mass and Obesity-Associated Protein) Participates in Hemorrhage-Induced Thalamic Pain by Stabilizing Toll-Like Receptor 4 Expression in Thalamic Neurons.,"Hemorrhage-caused gene changes in the thalamus likely contribute to thalamic pain genesis. RNA N6-methyladenosine modification is an additional layer of gene regulation. Whether FTO (fat-mass and obesity-associated protein), an N6-methyladenosine demethylase, participates in hemorrhage-induced thalamic pain is unknown. Expression of Fto mRNA and protein was assessed in mouse thalamus after hemorrhage caused by microinjection of Coll IV (type IV collagenase) into unilateral thalamus. Effect of intraperitoneal administration of meclofenamic acid (a FTO inhibitor) or microinjection of adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) expressing Cre into the thalamus of Ftofl/fl mice on the Coll IV microinjection–induced TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) upregulation and nociceptive hypersensitivity was examined. Effect of thalamic microinjection of AAV5 expressing Fto (AAV5-Fto) on basal thalamic TLR4 expression and nociceptive thresholds was also analyzed. Additionally, level of N6-methyladenosine in Tlr4 mRNA and its binding to FTO or YTHDF2 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2) were observed. FTO was detected in neuronal nuclei of thalamus. Level of FTO protein, but not mRNA, was time-dependently increased in the ipsilateral thalamus on days 1 to 14 after Coll IV microinjection. Intraperitoneal injection of meclofenamic acid or adeno-associated virus-5 expressing Cre microinjection into Ftofl/fl mouse thalamus attenuated the Coll IV microinjection–induced TLR4 upregulation and tissue damage in the ipsilateral thalamus and development and maintenance of nociceptive hypersensitivities on the contralateral side. Thalamic microinjection of AAV5-Fto increased TLR4 expression and elicited hypersensitivities to mechanical, heat and cold stimuli. Mechanistically, Coll IV microinjection produced an increase in FTO binding to Tlr4 mRNA, an FTO-dependent loss of N6-methyladenosine sites in Tlr4 mRNA and a reduction in the binding of YTHDF2 to Tlr4 mRNA in the ipsilateral thalamus. Our findings suggest that FTO participates in hemorrhage-induced thalamic pain by stabilizing TLR4 upregulation in thalamic neurons.

34187083,2022,Beyond CGRP: The calcitonin peptide family as targets for migraine and pain.,"The CGRP system has emerged as a key pharmacological target for the treatment of migraine. However, some individuals who suffer from migraine have low or no response to anti-CGRP or other treatments, suggesting the need for additional clinical targets. CGRP belongs to the calcitonin family of peptides, which includes calcitonin, amylin, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2. These peptides display a range of pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive actions, in primary headache conditions such as migraine. Calcitonin family peptides also show expression at sites relevant to migraine and pain. This suggests that calcitonin family peptides and their receptors, beyond CGRP, may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of migraine and other pain disorders. This review considers the localisation of the calcitonin family in peripheral pain pathways and discusses how they may contribute to migraine and pain.

34232927,2022,Mitochondrial calcium uniporter deletion prevents painful diabetic neuropathy by restoring mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.,"Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication affecting 25% of diabetic patients. Painful diabetic neuropathy is characterized by neuropathic pain accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability, resulting in calcium overload, axonal degeneration, and loss of cutaneous innervation. The molecular pathways underlying these effects are unknown. Using high-throughput and deep-proteome profiling, we found that mitochondrial fission proteins were elevated in DRG neurons from mice with PDN induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). In vivo calcium imaging revealed increased calcium signaling in DRG nociceptors from mice with PDN. Furthermore, using electron microscopy, we showed that mitochondria in DRG nociceptors had fragmented morphology as early as 2 weeks after starting HFD, preceding the onset of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration. Moreover, preventing calcium entry into the mitochondria, by selectively deleting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter from these neurons, restored normal mitochondrial morphology, prevented axonal degeneration, and reversed mechanical allodynia in the HFD mouse model of PDN. These studies suggest a molecular cascade linking neuropathic pain to axonal degeneration in PDN. In particular, nociceptor hyperexcitability and the associated increased intracellular calcium concentrations could lead to excessive calcium entry into mitochondria mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, resulting in increased calcium-dependent mitochondrial fission and ultimately contributing to small-fiber degeneration and neuropathic pain in PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting calcium entry into nociceptor mitochondria may represent a promising effective and disease-modifying therapeutic approach for this currently intractable and widespread affliction. Moreover, these results are likely to inform studies of other neurodegenerative disease involving similar underlying events.","Animals;Calcium;Calcium Channels;Calcium Signaling;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Diet, High-Fat;Disease;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Lead;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Microscopy, Electron;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Fission;Neuralgia;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Neurons;Nociceptors;Patients;Proteins;Proteome;Therapeutics",Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Ganglion Cysts;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Neurodegenerative Diseases,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34289083,2022,Pharmacological characterisation of mouse calcitonin and calcitonin receptor-like receptors reveals differences compared with human receptors.,"The calcitonin (CT) receptor family is complex, comprising two receptors (the CT receptor [CTR] and the CTR-like receptor [CLR]), three accessory proteins (RAMPs) and multiple endogenous peptides. This family contains several important drug targets, including CGRP, which is targeted by migraine therapeutics. The pharmacology of this receptor family is poorly characterised in species other than rats and humans. To facilitate understanding of translational and preclinical data, we need to know the receptor pharmacology of this family in mice. Plasmids encoding mouse CLR/CTR and RAMPs were transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells. cAMP production was measured in response to agonists in the absence or presence of antagonists. We report the first synthesis and characterisation of mouse adrenomedullin, adrenomedullin 2 and βCGRP and of mouse CTR without or with mouse RAMPs. Receptors containing m-CTR had subtly different pharmacology than human receptors; they were promiscuous in their pharmacology, both with and without RAMPs. Several peptides, including mouse αCGRP and mouse adrenomedullin 2, were potent agonists of the m-CTR:m-RAMP3 complex. Pharmacological profiles of receptors comprising m-CLR:m-RAMPs were generally similar to those of their human counterparts, albeit with reduced specificity. Mouse receptor pharmacology differed from that in humans, with mouse receptors displaying reduced discrimination between ligands. This creates challenges for interpreting which receptor may underlie an effect in preclinical models and thus translation of findings from mice to humans. It also highlights the need for new ligands to differentiate between these complexes. This article is part of a themed issue on Advances in Migraine and Headache Therapy (BJP 75th Anniversary)..

34299208,2021,Emerging Role of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) Ion Channel in Acute and Chronic Itch.,"Itch is a clinical problem that leaves many sufferers insufficiently treated, with over 20 million cases in the United States. This is due to incomplete understanding of its molecular, cellular, and cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are involved in several sensory modalities including pain, vision, taste, olfaction, hearing, touch, and thermosensation, as well as itch. Relative to the extensive studies on TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels in itch modulation, TRPV4 has received relatively little research attention and its mechanisms have remained poorly understood until recently. TRPV4 is expressed in ganglion sensory neurons and a variety of skin cells. Growing evidence in the past few years strongly suggests that TRPV4 in these cells contributes to acute and chronic disease-associated itch. This review focuses on the current experimental evidence involving TRPV4 in itch under pathophysiological conditions and discusses its possible cellular and molecular mechanisms.","Acute Disease;Animals;Attention;Cells;Chronic Disease;Comprehension;Ganglia, Sensory;Hearing;Humans;Ion Channels;Keratinocytes;Neurons;Pain;Pruritus;Relatives;Research;Review;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Skin;Smell;TRPV Cation Channels;Taste;Touch;Transients;United States;Vision, Ocular",Acute Disease;Chronic Disease;Ganglion Cysts;Pain;Pruritus,Int J Mol Sci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34334792,2021,PGE2/EP4 skeleton interoception activity reduces vertebral endplate porosity and spinal pain with low-dose celecoxib.,"Skeletal interoception regulates bone homeostasis through the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentration in bone. Vertebral endplates undergo ossification and become highly porous during intervertebral disc degeneration and aging. We found that the PGE2 concentration was elevated in porous endplates to generate spinal pain. Importantly, treatment with a high-dose cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor (celecoxib, 80 mg·kg-1 per day) decreased the prostaglandin E2 concentration and attenuated spinal pain in mice with lumbar spine instability. However, this treatment impaired bone formation in porous endplates, and spinal pain recurred after discontinuing the treatment. Interestingly, low-dose celecoxib (20 mg·kg-1 per day, which is equivalent to one-quarter of the clinical maximum dosage) induced a latent inhibition of spinal pain at 3 weeks post-treatment, which persisted even after discontinuing treatment. Furthermore, when the prostaglandin E2 concentration was maintained at the physiological level with low-dose celecoxib, endplate porosity was reduced significantly, which was associated with decreased sensory nerve innervation and spinal pain. These findings suggest that low-dose celecoxib may help to maintain skeletal interoception and decrease vertebral endplate porosity, thereby reducing sensory innervation and spinal pain in mice.",Aging;Bones;Celecoxib;Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors;Dinoprostone;Homeostasis;Interoception;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Mice;Osteogenesis;Pain;Porosity;Skeleton;Spine;Therapeutics,Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Pain,Bone Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34497285,2021,Pituitary hormones are specifically expressed in trigeminal sensory neurons and contribute to pain responses in the trigeminal system.,"Trigeminal (TG), dorsal root (DRG), and nodose/jugular (NG/JG) ganglia each possess specialized and distinct functions. We used RNA sequencing of two-cycle sorted Pirt-positive neurons to identify genes exclusively expressing in L3-L5 DRG, T10-L1 DRG, NG/JG, and TG mouse ganglion neurons. Transcription factor Phox2b and Efcab6 are specifically expressed in NG/JG while Hoxa7 is exclusively present in both T10-L1 and L3-L5 DRG neurons. Cyp2f2, Krt18, and Ptgds, along with pituitary hormone prolactin (Prl), growth hormone (Gh), and proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) encoding genes are almost exclusively in TG neurons. Immunohistochemistry confirmed selective expression of these hormones in TG neurons and dural nerves; and showed GH expression in subsets of TRPV1+ and CGRP+ TG neurons. We next examined GH roles in hypersensitivity in the spinal versus trigeminal systems. Exogenous GH produced mechanical hypersensitivity when injected intrathecally, but not intraplantarly. GH-induced thermal hypersensitivity was not detected in the spinal system. GH dose-dependently generated orofacial and headache-like periorbital mechanical hypersensitivity after administration into masseter muscle and dura, respectively. Periorbital mechanical hypersensitivity was reversed by a GH receptor antagonist, pegvisomant. Overall, pituitary hormone genes are selective for TG versus other ganglia somatotypes; and GH has distinctive functional significance in the trigeminal versus spinal systems.","Administration;Animals;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Dorsal Roots;Ganglia;Ganglia, Spinal;Ganglion Cysts;Genes;Growth Hormone;Headache;Hormones;Hypersensitivity;Immunohistochemistry;Masseter Muscle;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Neurons;Nodose Ganglion;Overall;Pain;Pituitary Hormones;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Prolactin;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Somatotypes;Transcription Factors;Trigeminal Ganglion",Ganglion Cysts;Headache;Hypersensitivity;Pain,Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34531285,2021,Sex Differences in Protein Kinase A Signaling of the Latent Postoperative Pain Sensitization That Is Masked by Kappa Opioid Receptors in the Spinal Cord.,"Latent sensitization (LS) of pain engages pronociceptive signaling pathways in the dorsal horn that include NMDA receptor (NMDAR)→adenylyl cyclase-1 (AC1)→protein kinase A (PKA), and exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP (Epacs). To determine whether these pathways operate similarly between males and females or are under the inhibitory control of spinal κ opioid receptors (KOR), we allowed hyperalgesia to resolve after plantar incision and then blocked KOR with intrathecal administration of LY2456302, which reinstated hyperalgesia and facilitated touch-evoked immunoreactivity of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in neurons (NeuN) but not astrocytes (GFAPs) nor microglia (Iba1). LY2456302 reinstated hyperalgesia even when administered 13 months later, indicating that chronic postoperative pain vulnerability persists for over a year in a latent state of remission. In both sexes, intrathecal MK-801 (an NMDAR competitive antagonist) prevented LY2456302-evoked reinstatement of hyperalgesia as did AC1 gene deletion or the AC1 inhibitor NB001. NB001 also prevented stimulus-evoked pERK. In both sexes, the Epac inhibitor ESI-09 prevented reinstatement, whereas the Epac activator 8-CPT reinstated hyperalgesia. By contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 prevented reinstatement only in male mice, whereas the PKA activator 6-bnz-cAMP itself evoked reinstatement at all doses tested (3-30 nmol, i.t.). In neither sex did incision change gene expression of KOR, GluN1, PKA, or Epac1 in dorsal horn. We conclude that sustained KOR signaling inhibits spinal PKA-dependent mechanisms that drive postoperative LS in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings support the development of AC1, PKA, and Epac inhibitors toward a new pharmacotherapy for chronic postoperative pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Because of neural mechanisms that are not well understood, men and women respond differently to treatments for chronic pain. We report that surgical incision recruits a pronociceptive latent pain sensitization that persisted for over a year and was kept in check by the sustained analgesic activity of κ opioid receptors. NMDAR→AC1→cAMP→Epac signaling pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord maintain latent sensitization in both males and females; however, only males recruit a PKA-dependent mechanism. This work presents a novel male-specific mechanism for the promotion of chronic postoperative pain.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Adenylyl Cyclases;Administration;Analgesics;Animals;Astrocytes;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chronic Pain;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Drive;Drug Therapy;Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases;Female;Gene Deletion;Gene Expression;Hyperalgesia;MK-801;Male;Men;Mice;Microglia;Neurons;News;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Proteins;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Report;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Surgical Wound;Therapeutics;Touch;Women;Work","Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Surgical Wound",J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34572924,2021,Cathepsin S Evokes PAR2-Dependent Pain in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients and Preclinical Mouse Models.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) pain is more prevalent and severe than pain generated by any other form of cancer. We previously showed that protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) contributes to oral SCC pain. Cathepsin S is a lysosomal cysteine protease released during injury and disease that can activate PAR2. We report here a role for cathepsin S in PAR2-dependent cancer pain. We report that cathepsin S was more active in human oral SCC than matched normal tissue, and in an orthotopic xenograft tongue cancer model than normal tongue. The multiplex immunolocalization of cathepsin S in human oral cancers suggests that carcinoma and macrophages generate cathepsin S in the oral cancer microenvironment. After cheek or paw injection, cathepsin S evoked nociception in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking PAR2 in Nav1.8-positive neurons (Par2Nav1.8), nor in mice treated with LY3000328 or an endogenous cathepsin S inhibitor (cystatin C). The human oral SCC cell line (HSC-3) with homozygous deletion of the gene for cathepsin S (CTSS) with CRISPR/Cas9 provoked significantly less mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, as did those treated with LY3000328, compared to the control cancer mice. Our results indicate that cathepsin S is activated in oral SCC, and that cathepsin S contributes to cancer pain through PAR2 on neurons.","Cancer;Cancer Pain;Cancer of Mouth;Cancer of Tongue;Carcinoma;Cathepsins;Cell Line;Cheek;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cystatin C;Cysteine Proteases;Disease;Form;Genes;Heterografts;Humans;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injections;Injuries;Macrophages;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Neurons;Nociception;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain;Patients;Receptor, PAR-2;Report;Role;Tissues;Tongue","Cancer;Cancer Pain;Cancer of Mouth;Cancer of Tongue;Carcinoma;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain",Cancers (Basel),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34580157,2021,Identification of Trigeminal Sensory Neuronal Types Innervating Masseter Muscle.,"Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to non-peptidergic IB-4+/TRPA1- or IB-4+/TRPA1+ groups, while two TRPV1+ small-sized neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP+ One small-sized CGRP+ neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from Nav1.8- or trkC+ neurons. The remaining CGRP+ neurons were medium-sized, could be divided into Nav1.8-/trkC- and Nav1.8low/trkC+ clusters, and showed large 5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC+ and had no Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1+/CGRP- (somatostatin+), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ (C-LTMR), TRPM8+, MrgprA3+, or trkB+ (Aδ-LTMR) subtypes have not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by either CGRP+/NFH+ or CGRP-/NFH+ medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.",Animals;Antibodies;Back;Callithrix jacchus;Cells;Comprehension;Electrophysiology;Face;Fascia;General Surgery;Immunohistochemistry;Masseter Muscle;Mice;Muscles;Neurofilaments;Neurons;Orofacial Pain;Overall;Pain;Platyrrhini;Sensory Receptor Cells;Serotonin;Somatostatin;TRPV Cation Channels;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Tendons;Tissues;Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase,Orofacial Pain;Pain;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,eNeuro,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34608164,2021,Inhibiting endocytosis in CGRP+ nociceptors attenuates inflammatory pain-like behavior.,"The advantage of locally applied anesthetics is that they are not associated with the many adverse effects, including addiction liability, of systemically administered analgesics. This therapeutic approach has two inherent pitfalls: specificity and a short duration of action. Here, we identified nociceptor endocytosis as a promising target for local, specific, and long-lasting treatment of inflammatory pain. We observed preferential expression of AP2α2, an α-subunit isoform of the AP2 complex, within CGRP+/IB4- nociceptors in rodents and in CGRP+ dorsal root ganglion neurons from a human donor. We utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit nociceptor endocytosis demonstrating its role in the development and maintenance of acute and chronic inflammatory pain. One-time injection of an AP2 inhibitor peptide significantly reduced acute and chronic pain-like behaviors and provided prolonged analgesia. We evidenced sexually dimorphic recovery responses to this pharmacological approach highlighting the importance of sex differences in pain development and response to analgesics.","Adaptor Protein Complex 2;Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits;Analgesia;Analgesics;Anesthetics;Animals;Behavior;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Chronic Pain;Donors;Endocytosis;Epidermis;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Genetics;Humans;Inflammation;Injections;Maintenance;Male;Mice;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Nociceptors;Pain;Peptides;Protein Isoforms;RNA, Small Interfering;Rodentia;Role;Sex Characteristics;Specificity;Therapeutics;Time",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Pain,Nat Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34699985,2022,Autonomic Regulation of Nociceptive and Immunologic Changes in a Mouse Model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.,"Chronic pain frequently develops after limb injuries, and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. We explored the hypothesis that the autonomic nervous system regulates adaptive immune system activation and nociceptive sensitization in a mouse model of chronic post-traumatic pain with features of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In studies sympathetic signaling was reduced using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or lofexidine, while parasympathetic signaling was augmented by nicotine administration. Hindpaw allodynia, unweighting, skin temperature, and edema were measured at 3 and 7 weeks after fracture. Hypertrophy of regional lymph nodes and IgM deposition in the skin of injured limbs were followed as indices of adaptive immune system activation. Passive transfer of serum from fracture mice to recipient B cell deficient (muMT) mice was used to assess the formation of pain-related autoantibodies. We observed that 6-OHDA or lofexidine reduced fracture-induced hindpaw nociceptive sensitization and unweighting. Nicotine had similar effects. These treatments also prevented IgM deposition, hypertrophy of popliteal lymph nodes, and the development of pronociceptive serum transfer effects. We conclude that inhibiting sympathetic or augmenting parasympathetic signaling inhibits pro-nociceptive immunological changes accompanying limb fracture. These translational results support the use of similar approaches in trials potentially alleviating persistent post-traumatic pain and, possibly, CRPS. PERSPECTIVE: Selective treatments aimed at autonomic nervous system modulation reduce fracture-related nociceptive and functional sequelae. The same treatment strategies limit pain-supporting immune system activation and the production of pro-nociceptive antibodies. Thus, the therapeutic regulation of autonomic activity after limb injury may reduce the incidence of chronic pain.","Administration;Allodynia;Animals;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Autonomic Nervous System;B-Lymphocytes;Chronic Pain;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Disease Models, Animal;Edema;Extremities;Fractures, Bone;Hypertrophy;Immune System;Immunity;Immunoglobulin M;Incidence;Injuries;Lymph Nodes;Mice;Nicotine;Nociception;Oxidopamine;Pain;Production;Regulation;Serum;Skin;Skin Temperature;Therapeutics","Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Edema;Fractures, Bone;Hypertrophy;Injuries;Pain",J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34730998,2021,Astrocytes contribute to pain gating in the spinal cord.,"Various pain therapies have been developed on the basis of the gate control theory of pain, which postulates that nonpainful sensory inputs mediated by large-diameter afferent fibers (Aβ-fibers) can attenuate noxious signals relayed to the brain. To date, this theory has focused only on neuronal mechanisms. Here, we identified an unprecedented function of astrocytes in the gating of nociceptive signals transmitted by neurokinin 1 receptor–positive (NK1R+) projection neurons in the spinal cord. Electrical stimulation of peripheral Aβ-fibers in naïve mice activated spinal astrocytes, which in turn induced long-term depression (LTD) in NK1R+ neurons and antinociception through activation of endogenous adenosinergic mechanisms. Suppression of astrocyte activation by pharmacologic, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulations blocked the induction of LTD in NK1R+ neurons and pain inhibition by Aβ-fiber stimulation. Collectively, our study introduces astrocytes as an important component of pain gating by activation of Aβ-fibers, which thus exert nonneuronal control of pain.","Astrocytes;Brain;Dates;Depression;Electric Stimulation;Mice;Neurons;Optogenetics;Pain;Projection;Receptors, Neurokinin-1;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics",Pain,Sci Adv,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34752775,2022,"Synchronized cluster firing, a distinct form of sensory neuron activation, drives spontaneous pain.","Spontaneous pain refers to pain occurring without external stimuli. It is a primary complaint in chronic pain conditions and remains difficult to treat. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying spontaneous pain remain poorly understood. Here we employed in vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and discovered a distinct form of abnormal spontaneous activity following peripheral nerve injury: clusters of adjacent DRG neurons firing synchronously and sporadically. The level of cluster firing correlated directly with nerve injury-induced spontaneous pain behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cluster firing is triggered by activity of sympathetic nerves, which sprout into DRGs after injury, and identified norepinephrine as a key neurotransmitter mediating this unique firing. Chemogenetic and pharmacological manipulations of sympathetic activity and norepinephrine receptors suggest that they are necessary and sufficient for DRG cluster firing and spontaneous pain behavior. Therefore, blocking sympathetically mediated cluster firing may be a new paradigm for treating spontaneous pain.","Behavior;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drive;Form;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Injuries;Mediating;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;News;Norepinephrine;Norepinephrine Receptors;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Receptors, Adrenergic;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Nerves;Sympathetic Nervous System",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Injuries;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Neuron,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34757807,2021,Selective targeting of NaV1.7 via inhibition of the CRMP2-Ubc9 interaction reduces pain in rodents.,"The voltage-gated sodium NaV1.7 channel, critical for sensing pain, has been actively targeted by drug developers; however, there are currently no effective and safe therapies targeting NaV1.7. Here, we tested whether a different approach, indirect NaV1.7 regulation, could have antinociceptive effects in preclinical models. We found that preventing addition of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) on the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 functions and had antinociceptive effects in rodents. In silico targeting of the SUMOylation site in CRMP2 (Lys374) identified &gt;200 hits, of which compound 194 exhibited selective in vitro and ex vivo NaV1.7 engagement. Orally administered 194 was not only antinociceptive in preclinical models of acute and chronic pain but also demonstrated synergy alongside other analgesics—without eliciting addiction, rewarding properties, or neurotoxicity. Analgesia conferred by 194 was opioid receptor dependent. Our results demonstrate that 194 is a first-in-class protein-protein inhibitor that capitalizes on CRMP2-NaV1.7 regulation to deliver safe analgesia in rodents.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Chronic Pain;In Silico;In Vitro;NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Proteins;Receptors, Opioid;Regulation;Rodentia;Semaphorin-3A;Sodium;Sumoylation;Therapeutics;Ubiquitins",Chronic Pain;Pain,Sci Transl Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

34776867,2021,Transient Receptor Potential Channels and Botulinum Neurotoxins in Chronic Pain.,"Pain afflicts more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, with hundreds of millions suffering from unrelieved chronic pain. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of developing better interventions for the relief of chronic pain, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this condition. However, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in nociceptors have been shown to be essential players in the generation and progression of pain and have attracted the attention of several pharmaceutical companies as therapeutic targets. Unfortunately, TRP channel inhibitors have failed in clinical trials, at least in part due to their thermoregulatory function. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) have emerged as novel and safe pain therapeutics because of their regulation of exocytosis and pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters. However, it is becoming evident that BoNTs also regulate the expression and function of TRP channels, which may explain their analgesic effects. Here, we summarize the roles of TRP channels in pain, with a particular focus on TRPV1 and TRPA1, their regulation by BoNTs, and briefly discuss the use of BoNTs for the treatment of chronic pain.",Analgesics;Attention;Botulinum Toxins;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Exocytosis;Generations;Ion Channels;Migraine Disorders;Neurotransmitters;Nociceptors;Pain;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Regulation;Role;Therapeutics;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Transients,Chronic Pain;Migraine Disorders;Pain,Front Mol Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34790097,2021,Transient Receptor Potential Channel 4 Small-Molecule Inhibition Alleviates Migraine-Like Behavior in Mice.,"Migraine is a common neurological disorder with few available treatment options. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 4 (TRPC4) in itch and the modulation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a biomarker and emerging therapeutic target for migraine. In this study, we characterized the role of TRPC4 in pain and evaluated its inhibition as anti-migraine pain therapy in preclinical mouse models. First, we found that TRPC4 is highly expressed in trigeminal ganglia and its activation not only mediates itch but also pain. Second, we demonstrated that the small-molecule inhibitor ML204, a specific TRPC4 antagonist, significantly reduced episodic and chronic migraine-like behaviors in male and female mice after injection of nitroglycerin (NTG), a well-known migraine inducer in rodents and humans. Third, we found a significant decrease in CGRP protein levels in the plasma of both male and female mice treated with ML-204, which largely prevented the development of chronic migraine-like behavior. Using sensory neuron cultures, we confirmed that activation of TRPC4 elicited release of CGRP, which was significantly diminished by ML-204. Collectively, our findings identify TRPC4 in peripheral sensory neurons as a mediator of CGRP release and NTG-evoked migraine. Since a TRPC4 antagonist is already in clinical trials, we expect that this study will rapidly lead to novel and effective clinical treatments for migraineurs.",Behavior;Biomarkers;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Clinical Trial;Culture;Female;Headache;Humans;Injections;Lead;Male;Mice;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;Nitroglycerin;Pain;Plasma;Proteins;Rodentia;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;TRPC Cation Channels;Therapeutics;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Trigeminal Ganglion,Headache;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;Pain,Front Mol Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

34915156,2022,An HDAC6 inhibitor reverses chemotherapy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity via an IL-10 and macrophage dependent pathway.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) impacts a growing number of cancer survivors and treatment options are limited. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors are attractive candidates because they reverse established CIPN and may enhance anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy. Before considering clinical application of HDAC6 inhibitors, the mechanisms underlying reversal of CIPN need to be identified. We showed previously that deletion of Hdac6 from sensory neurons did not prevent cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, while global deletion of Hdac6 was protective, indicating involvement of HDAC6 in other cell types. Here we show that local depletion of MRC1 (CD206)-positive macrophages without affecting microglia by intrathecal administration of mannosylated clodronate liposomes reduced the capacity of an HDAC6 inhibitor to reverse cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. The HDAC6 inhibitor increased spinal cord Il10 mRNA and this was M2-macrophage dependent. Intrathecal administration of anti-IL-10 antibody or genetic deletion of Il10 prevented resolution of mechanical hypersensitivity. Genetic deletion of the IL-10 receptor from Advillin+ neurons prevented resolution of mechanical hypersensitivity in mice treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor. These findings indicate that treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor increases macrophage-derived IL-10 signaling to IL-10 receptors on Advillin+ sensory neurons to resolve mechanical hypersensitivity. Cisplatin decreases mitochondrial function in sensory axons, and HDAC6 inhibition can promote axonal transport of healthy mitochondria. Indeed, the HDAC6 inhibitor normalized cisplatin-induced tibial nerve mitochondrial deficits. However, this was independent of macrophages and IL-10 signaling. In conclusion, our findings indicate that administration of an HDAC6 inhibitor reverses cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity through two complementary pathways: macrophage HDAC6 inhibition to promote IL-10 production and IL-10 signaling to DRG neurons, and neuronal HDAC6 inhibition to restore axonal mitochondrial health.","Administration;Animals;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;Axonal Transport;Axons;Cancer Survivors;Cells;Cisplatin;Clodronate;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Genetics;Health;Histone Deacetylase 6;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Interleukin-10;Liposomes;Macrophages;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Mitochondria;Needs;Neoplasms;Neurons;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Production;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Interleukin-10;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics;Tibial Nerve",Cancer;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Neoplasms;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34983286,2022,Small molecule targeting NaV1.7 via inhibition of the CRMP2-Ubc9 interaction reduces pain in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats.,"The voltage-gated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7 is a critical player in the transmission of nociceptive information. This channel has been heavily implicated in human genetic pain disorders and is a validated pain target. However, targeting this channel directly has failed, and an indirect approach - disruption of interactions with accessory protein partners - has emerged as a viable alternative strategy. We recently reported that a small-molecule inhibitor of CRMP2 SUMOylation, compound 194, selectively reduces NaV1.7 currents in DRG neurons across species from mouse to human. This compound also reversed mechanical allodynia in a spared nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced model of neuropathic pain. Here, we show that oral administration of 194 reverses mechanical allodynia in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, we show that orally administered 194 reverses the increased latency to cross an aversive barrier in a mechanical conflict-avoidance task following CCI. These two findings, in the context of our previous report, support the conclusion that 194 is a robust inhibitor of NaV1.7 function with the ultimate effect of profoundly ameliorating mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury. The fact that this was observed using both traditional, evoked measures of pain behavior as well as the more recently developed operator-independent mechanical conflict-avoidance assay increases confidence in the efficacy of 194-induced anti-nociception.","Administration, Oral;Animals;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Constriction;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Human Genetics;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Measures;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain Disorder;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Rats;Report;Sumoylation;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Pain Disorder,Channels (Austin),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35029600,2022,"Conditional knockout of CRMP2 in neurons, but not astrocytes, disrupts spinal nociceptive neurotransmission to control the initiation and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain.","Mechanistic studies principally focusing on primary afferent nociceptive neurons uncovered the upregulation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2)-a dual trafficking regulator of N-type voltage-gated calcium (Cav2.2) as well as Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channels-as a potential determinant of neuropathic pain. Whether CRMP2 contributes to aberrant excitatory synaptic transmission underlying neuropathic pain processing after peripheral nerve injury is unknown. Here, we interrogated CRMP2's role in synaptic transmission and in the initiation or maintenance of chronic pain. In rats, short-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2 in the spinal cord reduced the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, but not spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, recorded from superficial dorsal horn neurons in acute spinal cord slices. No effect was observed on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In a complementary targeted approach, conditional knockout of CRMP2 from mouse neurons using a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha promoter to drive Cre recombinase expression reduced the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, but not miniature excitatory SCss. Conditional knockout of CRMP2 from mouse astrocytes using a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter had no effect on synaptic transmission. Conditional knockout of CRMP2 in neurons reversed established mechanical allodynia induced by a spared nerve injury in both male and female mice. In addition, the development of spared nerve injury-induced allodynia was also prevented in these mice. Our data strongly suggest that CRMP2 is a key regulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission driving pain signaling and that it contributes to the transition of physiological pain into pathological pain.","Allodynia;Animals;Astrocytes;Calcium;Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases;Chronic Pain;Drive;Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents;Female;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents;Injuries;Maintenance;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Posterior Horn Cells;Proteins;RNA, Small Interfering;Rats;Recombinases;Role;Semaphorin-3A;Spinal Cord;Synaptic Transmission;Up-Regulation",Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

However, the mechanism of action for CGX analgesia is unknown. We hypothesized that spinal application of CGX produces antinociception through activation of the presynaptic neurotensin receptor (NTSR)2. In this study, we assessed the mechanisms of CGX antinociception in rodent models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Intrathecal administration of CGX, dose dependently, inhibited thermal and mechanical hypersensitivities in rodents of both sexes. Pharmacological and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 editing of NTSR2 reversed CGX-induced antinociception without affecting morphine analgesia. Electrophysiological and gene editing approaches demonstrated that CGX inhibition was dependent on the R-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav2.3) in sensory neurons. Anatomical studies demonstrated coexpression of NTSR2 and Cav2.3 in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Finally, synaptic fractionation and slice electrophysiology recordings confirmed a predominantly presynaptic effect. Together, these data reveal a nonopioid pathway engaged by a human-tested drug to produce antinociception.","Administration;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Calcium Channel Blockers;Calcium Channels;Calcium Channels, R-Type;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Conotoxins;Electrophysiology;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Editing;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Male;Morphine;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Neurotensin;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Receptors, Neurotensin;Rodentia;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex",Ganglion Cysts;Hypersensitivity;Neuralgia,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35110404,2022,Mice expressing fluorescent PAR2 reveal that endocytosis mediates colonic inflammation and pain.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate many pathophysiological processes and are major therapeutic targets. The impact of disease on the subcellular distribution and function of GPCRs is poorly understood. We investigated trafficking and signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in colitis. To localize PAR2 and assess redistribution during disease, we generated knockin mice expressing PAR2 fused to monomeric ultrastable green fluorescent protein (muGFP). PAR2-muGFP signaled and trafficked normally. PAR2 messenger RNA was detected at similar levels in Par2-mugfp and wild-type mice. Immunostaining with a GFP antibody and RNAScope in situ hybridization using F2rl1 (PAR2) and Gfp probes revealed that PAR2-muGFP was expressed in epithelial cells of the small and large intestine and in subsets of enteric and dorsal root ganglia neurons. In healthy mice, PAR2-muGFP was prominently localized to the basolateral membrane of colonocytes. In mice with colitis, PAR2-muGFP was depleted from the plasma membrane of colonocytes and redistributed to early endosomes, consistent with generation of proinflammatory proteases that activate PAR2 PAR2 agonists stimulated endocytosis of PAR2 and recruitment of Gαq, Gαi, and β-arrestin to early endosomes of T84 colon carcinoma cells. PAR2 agonists increased paracellular permeability of colonic epithelial cells, induced colonic inflammation and hyperalgesia in mice, and stimulated proinflammatory cytokine release from segments of human colon. Knockdown of dynamin-2 (Dnm2), the major colonocyte isoform, and Dnm inhibition attenuated PAR2 endocytosis, signaling complex assembly and colonic inflammation and hyperalgesia. Thus, PAR2 endocytosis sustains protease-evoked inflammation and nociception and PAR2 in endosomes is a potential therapeutic target for colitis.","Animals;Antibodies;Arrestins;Carcinoma;Cell Membrane;Cells;Colitis;Colon;Cytokines;Disease;Dynamin II;Endocytosis;Endosomes;Epithelial Cells;Female;Fluorescent Dyes;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Green Fluorescent Proteins;Humans;Hyperalgesia;In Situ Hybridization;Inflammation;Intestine, Large;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neurons;Nociception;Pain;Peptide Hydrolases;Permeability;Protein Isoforms;RNA, Messenger;Receptor, PAR-2;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics;beta-Arrestins",Carcinoma;Colitis;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Pain,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35115501,2022,Schwann cell endosome CGRP signals elicit periorbital mechanical allodynia in mice.,"Efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor (calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity modifying protein-1, CLR/RAMP1) implicates peripherally-released CGRP in migraine pain. However, the site and mechanism of CGRP-evoked peripheral pain remain unclear. By cell-selective RAMP1 gene deletion, we reveal that CGRP released from mouse cutaneous trigeminal fibers targets CLR/RAMP1 on surrounding Schwann cells to evoke periorbital mechanical allodynia. CLR/RAMP1 activation in human and mouse Schwann cells generates long-lasting signals from endosomes that evoke cAMP-dependent formation of NO. NO, by gating Schwann cell transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), releases ROS, which in a feed-forward manner sustain allodynia via nociceptor TRPA1. When encapsulated into nanoparticles that release cargo in acidified endosomes, a CLR/RAMP1 antagonist provides superior inhibition of CGRP signaling and allodynia in mice. Our data suggest that the CGRP-mediated neuronal/Schwann cell pathway mediates allodynia associated with neurogenic inflammation, contributing to the algesic action of CGRP in mice.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Allodynia;Animals;Ankyrins;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Calcitonin Receptor-Like Protein;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Endosomes;Female;Gene Deletion;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Mice, Transgenic;Middle Aged;Migraine Disorders;Nanoparticles;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neurons;Nitric Oxide;Nociceptors;Pain;Ramps;Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1;Receptors, Calcitonin;Schwann Cells;Signal Transduction;TRPA1 Cation Channel;Transients",Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Mechanical Allodynia;Migraine Disorders;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain,Nat Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35256532,2022,Opioid-Induced Pronociceptive Signaling in the Gastrointestinal Tract Is Mediated by Delta-Opioid Receptor Signaling.,"Opioid tolerance (OT) leads to dose escalation and serious side effects, including opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We sought to better understand the mechanisms underlying this event in the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic in vivo administration of morphine by intraperitoneal injection in male C57BL/6 mice evoked tolerance and evidence of OIH in an assay of colonic afferent nerve mechanosensitivity; this was inhibited by the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) antagonist naltrindole when intraperitoneally injected in previous morphine administration. Patch-clamp studies of DRG neurons following overnight incubation with high concentrations of morphine, the µ-opioid receptors (MOPr) agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) or the DOPr agonist [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-Enkephalin evoked hyperexcitability. The pronociceptive actions of these opioids were blocked by the DOPr antagonist SDM25N but not the MOPr antagonist D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 The hyperexcitability induced by DAMGO was reversed after a 1 h washout, but reapplication of low concentrations of DAMGO or [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-Enkephalin restored the hyperexcitability, an effect mediated by protein kinase C. DOPr-dependent DRG neuron hyperexcitability was blocked by the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop 2, and the weakly internalizing DOPr agonist ARM390 did not cause hyperexcitability. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in HEK cells showed no evidence of switching of G-protein signaling from Gi to a Gs pathway in response to either high concentrations or overnight incubation of opioids. Thus, chronic high-dose opioid exposure leads to opioid tolerance and features of OIH in the colon. This action is mediated by DOPr signaling and is dependent on receptor endocytosis and downstream protein kinase C signaling.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Opioids are effective in the treatment of abdominal pain, but escalating doses can lead to opioid tolerance and potentially opioid-induced hyperalgesia. We found that δ-opioid receptor (DOPr) plays a central role in the development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in colonic afferent nociceptors following prolonged exposure to high concentrations of MOPr or DOPr agonists. Furthermore, the role of DOPr was dependent on OPr internalization and activation of a protein kinase C signaling pathway. Thus, targeting DOPr or key components of the downstream signaling pathway could mitigate adverse side effects by opioids.","Abdominal Pain;Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Arm;Cells;Colon;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Tolerance;Endocytosis;Energy Transfer;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Enkephalin, Leucine-2-Alanine;Enkephalins;GTP-Binding Proteins;Ganglia, Spinal;Gastrointestinal Tract;Hyperalgesia;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Lead;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Morphine;Narcotic Antagonists;Neurons;Nociceptors;Opioids;Play;Protein Kinase C;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics",Abdominal Pain;Hyperalgesia,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35260535,2022,CD8+ T cell-derived IL-13 increases macrophage IL-10 to resolve neuropathic pain.,"Understanding the endogenous mechanisms regulating resolution of pain may identify novel targets for treatment of chronic pain. Resolution of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) after treatment completion depends on CD8+ T cells and on IL-10 produced by other cells. Using Rag2-/- mice lacking T and B cells and adoptive transfer of Il13-/- CD8+ T cells, we showed that CD8+ T cells producing IL-13 were required for resolution of CIPN. Intrathecal administration of anti-IL-13 delayed resolution of CIPN and reduced IL-10 production by dorsal root ganglion macrophages. Depleting local CD206+ macrophages also delayed resolution of CIPN. In vitro, TIM3+CD8+ T cells cultured with cisplatin, apoptotic cells, or phosphatidylserine liposomes produced IL-13, which induced IL-10 in macrophages. In vivo, resolution of CIPN was delayed by intrathecal administration of anti-TIM3. Resolution was also delayed in Rag2-/- mice reconstituted with Havcr2 (TIM3)-/- CD8+ T cells. Our data indicated that cell damage induced by cisplatin activated TIM3 on CD8+ T cells, leading to increased IL-13 production, which in turn induced macrophage IL-10 production and resolution of CIPN. Development of exogenous activators of the IL-13/IL-10 pain resolution pathway may provide a way to treat the underlying cause of chronic pain.","Administration;Adoptive Transfer;Aftercare;Animals;B-Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Cellular Immune Response;Chronic Pain;Cisplatin;Comprehension;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2;Hyperalgesia;In Vitro;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-13;Liposomes;Macrophages;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurosciences;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phosphatidylserines;Production;T-Lymphocytes;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Hepatitis A;Hyperalgesia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,JCI Insight,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35266833,2022,Oxytocin inhibits hindpaw hyperalgesia induced by orofacial inflammation combined with stress.,"Oxytocin (OT) is recognized as a critical neuropeptide in pain-related disorders. Chronic pain caused by the comorbidity of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is common, but whether OT plays an analgesic role in the comorbidity of TMD and FMS is unknown. Female rats with masseter muscle inflammation combined with 3-day forced swim (FS) stress developed somatic hypersensitivity, which modeled the comorbidity of TMD and FMS. Using this model, the effects of spinal OT administration on mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in hindpaws were examined. Furthermore, the protein levels of OT receptors and 5-HT2A receptors in the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn were analyzed by Western blot. The OT receptor antagonist atosiban and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ritanserin were intrathecally injected prior to OT injection in the separate groups. Intrathecal injection of 0.125 μg and 0.5 μg OT attenuated the hindpaw hyperalgesia. The expression of OT receptors and 5-HT2A receptors in the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn significantly increased following intrathecal injection of 0.5 μg OT. Intrathecal administration of either the OT receptor antagonist atosiban or 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ritanserin blocked the analgesic effect of OT. These results suggest that OT may inhibit hindpaw hyperalgesia evoked by orofacial inflammation combined with stress through OT receptors and/or 5-HT2A receptors, thus providing a therapeutic prospect for drugs targeting the OT system and for patients with comorbidity of TMD and FMS.","Administration;Analgesics;Animals;Blot, Western;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Drug Delivery Systems;Female;Fibromyalgia;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injections;Injections, Intrathecal;Masseter Muscle;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuropeptides;Oxytocin;Pain;Patients;Play;Proteins;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A;Ritanserin;Role;Serotonin;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Syndrome;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Therapeutics","Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Syndrome;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders",Mol Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35296422,2022,Duration of Reduction in Enduring Stress-Induced Hyperalgesia Via FKBP51 Inhibition Depends on Timing of Administration Relative to Traumatic Stress Exposure.,"Chronic pain development is a frequent outcome of severe stressor exposure, with or without tissue injury. Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH) is believed to play a central role, but the precise mechanisms mediating the development of chronic post-traumatic pain, and the time-dependency of these mechanisms, remain poorly understood. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a key stress system regulator, might prevent ESIH. We evaluated whether peritraumatic inhibition of FKBP51 in an animal model of traumatic stress exposure, the single prolonged stress (SPS) model, reversed ESIH evaluated via daily mechanical von Frey testing. FKBP51 inhibition was achieved using SAFit2, a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of FKBP51, administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats via intraperitoneal injection. To assess timing effects, FKBP51 was administered at different times relative to stress (SPS) exposure. SAFit2 administration immediately after SPS produced a complete reversal in ESIH lasting &gt;7 days. In contrast, SAFit2 administration 72 hours following SPS produced only temporary hyperalgesia reversal, and administration 120h following SPS had no effect. Similarly, animals undergoing SPS together with tissue injury (plantar incision) receiving SAFit2 immediately post-surgery developed acute hyperalgesia but recovered by 4 days and did not develop ESIH. These data suggest that: 1) FKBP51 plays an important, time-dependent role in ESIH pathogenesis, 2) time windows of opportunity may exist to prevent ESIH via FKBP51 inhibition after traumatic stress, with or without tissue injury, and 3) the use of inhibitors of specific pathways may provide new insights into chronic post-traumatic pain development. PERSPECTIVE: The current work adds to a growing body of literature indicating that FKBP51 inhibition is a highly promising potential treatment strategy for reducing hyperalgesia. In the case of post-traumatic chronic pain, we show that such a treatment strategy would be particularly impactful if administered early after traumatic stress exposure.","Administration;Animals;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Female;General Surgery;Hyperalgesia;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Injuries;Literature;Male;Mediating;Models, Animal;News;Pain;Play;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Relatives;Role;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins;Therapeutics;Time;Tissues;Work","Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Pain;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35444168,2022,"Hippocampal volume, FKBP5 genetic risk alleles, and childhood trauma interact to increase vulnerability to chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain.","Chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is common and highly morbid. However, vulnerability factors for CMP are poorly understood. Previous studies have independently shown that both small hippocampal brain volume and genetic risk alleles in a key stress system gene, FKBP5, increase vulnerability for chronic pain. However, little is known regarding the relationship between these factors and CMP. Here we tested the hypothesis that both small hippocampal brain volume and FKBP5 genetic risk, assessed using the tagging risk variant, FKBP5rs3800373, increase vulnerability for CMP. We used participant data from 36,822 individuals with available genetic, neuroimaging, and chronic pain data in the UK Biobank study. Although no main effects were observed, the interaction between FKBP5 genetic risk and right hippocampal volume was associated with CMP severity (β = -0.020, praw = 0.002, padj = 0.01). In secondary analyses, severity of childhood trauma further moderated the relationship between FKBP5 genetic risk, right hippocampal brain volume, and CMP (β = -0.081, p = 0.016). This study provides novel evidence that both FKBP5 genetic risk and childhood trauma moderate the relationship between right hippocampal brain volume and CMP. The data increases our understanding of vulnerability factors for CMP and builds a foundation for further work assessing causal relationships that might drive CMP development.","Adverse Childhood Experiences;Alleles;Brain;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Cytidine Monophosphate;Drive;Foundations;Genes;Genetics;Hippocampus;Humans;Musculoskeletal Pain;Neuroimaging;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Risk;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins;Work;Wounds and Injuries",Chronic Pain;Musculoskeletal Pain;Wounds and Injuries,Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35486864,2022,Preconditioning by voluntary wheel running attenuates later neuropathic pain via nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 antioxidant signaling in rats.,"Animal and human studies have shown that exercise prior to nerve injury prevents later chronic pain, but the mechanisms of such preconditioning remain elusive. Given that exercise acutely increases the formation of free radicals, triggering antioxidant compensation, we hypothesized that voluntary running preconditioning would attenuate neuropathic pain by supporting redox homeostasis after sciatic nerve injury in male and female rats. We show that 6 weeks of voluntary wheel running suppresses neuropathic pain development induced by chronic constriction injury across both sexes. This attenuation was associated with reduced nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity-a marker for peroxynitrite-at the sciatic nerve injury site. Our data suggest that prior voluntary wheel running does not reduce the production of peroxynitrite precursors, as expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase 2 were unchanged. Instead, voluntary wheel running increased superoxide scavenging by elevating expression of superoxide dismutases 1 and 2. Prevention of neuropathic pain was further associated with the activation of the master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Six weeks of prior voluntary wheel running increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation at the sciatic nerve injury site; in contrast, 3 weeks of prior wheel running, which failed to prevent neuropathic pain, had no effect on Nrf2 nuclear translocation. The protective effects of prior voluntary wheel running were mediated by Nrf2, as suppression was abolished across both sexes when Nrf2 activation was blocked during the 6-week running phase. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which physical activity may prevent neuropathic pain. Preconditioning by voluntary wheel running, terminated prior to nerve injury, suppresses later neuropathic pain in both sexes, and it is modulated through the activation of Nrf2-antioxidant signaling.","Animals;Antioxidants;Chronic Pain;Compensation;Constriction;Exercise;Female;Free Radicals;Homeostasis;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Male;Motor Activity;NADPH Oxidase 2;NF-E2-Related Factor 2;Neuralgia;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II;Oxidation-Reduction;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Peroxynitrite;Peroxynitrous Acid;Production;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Running;Sciatic Nerve;Sciatic Neuropathy;Sex;Superoxide Dismutase-1;Superoxides",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Sciatic Neuropathy,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35547239,2022,"CGRP Administration Into the Cerebellum Evokes Light Aversion, Tactile Hypersensitivity, and Nociceptive Squint in Mice.","The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a major player in migraine pathophysiology. Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of CGRP caused migraine-like behaviors in mice, but the sites of action in the brain remain unidentified. The cerebellum has the most CGRP binding sites in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized as both a sensory and motor integration center. The objective of this study was to test whether the cerebellum, particularly the medial cerebellar nuclei (MN), might be a site of CGRP action. In this study, CGRP was directly injected into the right MN of C57BL/6J mice via a cannula. A battery of tests was done to assess preclinical behaviors that are surrogates of migraine-like symptoms. CGRP caused light aversion measured as decreased time in the light zone even with dim light. The mice also spent more time resting in the dark zone, but not the light, along with decreased rearing and transitions between zones. These behaviors were similar for both sexes. Moreover, significant responses to CGRP were seen in the open field assay, von Frey test, and automated squint assay, indicating anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain, respectively. Interestingly, CGRP injection caused significant anxiety and spontaneous pain responses only in female mice, and a more robust tactile hypersensitivity in female mice. No detectable effect of CGRP on gait was observed in either sex. These results suggest that CGRP injection in the MN causes light aversion accompanied by increased anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. A caveat is that we cannot exclude contributions from other cerebellar regions in addition to the MN due to diffusion of the injected peptide. These results reveal the cerebellum as a new site of CGRP actions that may contribute to migraine-like hypersensitivity.",Administration;Anxiety;Behavior;Binding Sites;Brain;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cannula;Central Nervous System;Cerebellar Nuclei;Cerebellum;Diffusion;Female;Gait;Hypersensitivity;Injections;Light;Mice;Migraine Disorders;Neuropeptides;News;Pain;Peptides;Sex;Strabismus;Time,Hypersensitivity;Migraine Disorders;Pain;Strabismus,Front Pain Res (Lausanne),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35620595,2022,"CGRP and the Calcitonin Receptor are Co-Expressed in Mouse, Rat and Human Trigeminal Ganglia Neurons.","The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed in the trigeminal ganglia, a key site in craniofacial pain and migraine. CGRP potently activates two receptors: the CGRP receptor and the AMY1 receptor. These receptors are heterodimers consisting of receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) with either the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) to form the CGRP receptor or the calcitonin receptor (CTR) to form the AMY1 receptor. The expression of the CGRP receptor in trigeminal ganglia has been described in several studies; however, there is comparatively limited data available describing AMY1 receptor expression and in which cellular subtypes it is found. This research aimed to determine the relative distributions of the AMY1 receptor subunit, CTR, and CGRP in neurons or glia in rat, mouse and human trigeminal ganglia. Antibodies against CTR, CGRP and neuronal/glial cell markers were applied to trigeminal ganglia sections to investigate their distribution. CTR-like and CGRP-like immunoreactivity were observed in both discrete and overlapping populations of neurons. In rats and mice, 30-40% of trigeminal ganglia neurons displayed CTR-like immunoreactivity in their cell bodies, with approximately 78-80% of these also containing CGRP-like immunoreactivity. Although human cases were more variable, a similar overall pattern of CTR-like immunoreactivity to rodents was observed in the human trigeminal ganglia. CTR and CGRP appeared to be primarily colocalized in small to medium sized neurons, suggesting that colocalization of CTR and CGRP may occur in C-fiber neurons. CGRP-like or CTR-like immunoreactivity were not typically observed in glial cells. Western blotting confirmed that CTR was expressed in the trigeminal ganglia of all three species. These results confirm that CTR is expressed in trigeminal ganglia neurons. The identification of populations of neurons that express both CGRP and CTR suggests that CGRP could act in an autocrine manner through a CTR-based receptor, such as the AMY1 receptor. Overall, this suggests that a trigeminal ganglia CTR-based receptor may be activated during migraine and could therefore represent a potential target to develop treatments for craniofacial pain and migraine.","Antibodies;Blotting, Western;C Fibers;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Calcitonin Receptor-Like Protein;Cell Body;Craniofacial Pain;Form;Headache;Humans;Islet Amyloid Polypeptide;Mice;Migraine Disorders;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Overall;Population;Ramps;Rats;Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1;Receptors, Calcitonin;Receptors, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Relatives;Research;Rodentia;Therapeutics;Trigeminal Ganglion",Craniofacial Pain;Headache;Migraine Disorders,Front Physiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35691467,2022,Spinal CCK1 Receptors Contribute to Somatic Pain Hypersensitivity Induced by Malocclusion via a Reciprocal Neuron-Glial Signaling Cascade.,"Recent studies have shown that the incidence of chronic primary pain including temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) often exhibit comorbidities. We recently reported that central sensitization and descending facilitation system contributed to the development of somatic pain hypersensitivity induced by orofacial inflammation combined with stress. The purpose of this study was to explore whether TMD caused by unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) can induce somatic pain hypersensitivity, and whether the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor-mediated descending facilitation system promotes hypersensitivity through neuron-glia cell signaling cascade. UAC evoked thermal and mechanical pain hypersensitivity of the hind paws from day 5 to 70 that peaked at week 4 post UAC. The expression levels of CCK1 receptors, interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-18 receptors (IL-18R) were significantly up-regulated in the L4 to L5 spinal dorsal horn at 4 weeks post UAC. Intrathecal injection of CCK1 and IL-18 receptor antagonists blocked somatic pain hypersensitivity. IL-18 mainly co-localized with microglia, while IL-18R mainly co-localized with astrocytes and to a lesser extent with neurons. These findings indicate that the signaling transduction between neurons and glia at the spinal cord level contributes to the descending pain facilitation through CCK1 receptors during the development of the comorbidity of TMD and FMS. PERSPECTIVE: CCK1 receptor-dependent descending facilitation may mediate central mechanisms underlying the development of widespread somatic pain via a reciprocal neuron-glial signaling cascade, providing novel therapeutic targets for the clinical treatment of TMD and FMS comorbidities.","Animals;Astrocytes;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Cholecystokinin;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Crossbite;Exhibition;Fibromyalgia;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Incidence;Inflammation;Injections, Intrathecal;Interleukin-18;Malocclusion;Microglia;Neuroglia;Neurons;Nociceptive Pain;Pain;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptor, Cholecystokinin A;Receptor, Cholecystokinin B;Receptors, Cholecystokinin;Receptors, Interleukin-18;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Syndrome;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Therapeutics;Tissue Pain",Chronic Pain;Crossbite;Fibromyalgia;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Malocclusion;Nociceptive Pain;Pain;Syndrome;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Tissue Pain,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35705684,2022,TGR5 agonists induce peripheral and central hypersensitivity to bladder distension.,"The mechanisms underlying chronic bladder conditions such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) are incompletely understood. However, targeting specific receptors mediating neuronal sensitivity to specific stimuli is an emerging treatment strategy. Recently, irritant-sensing receptors including the bile acid receptor TGR5, have been identified within the viscera and are thought to play a key role in neuronal hypersensitivity. Here, in mice, we identify mRNA expression of TGR5 (Gpbar1) in all layers of the bladder as well as in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in isolated bladder-innervating DRG neurons. In bladder-innervating DRG neurons Gpbar1 mRNA was 100% co-expressed with Trpv1 and 30% co-expressed with Trpa1. In vitro live-cell calcium imaging of bladder-innervating DRG neurons showed direct activation of a sub-population of bladder-innervating DRG neurons with the synthetic TGR5 agonist CCDC, which was diminished in Trpv1-/- but not Trpa1-/- DRG neurons. CCDC also activated a small percentage of non-neuronal cells. Using an ex vivo mouse bladder afferent recording preparation we show intravesical application of endogenous (5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one sulphate, Pg5α) and synthetic (CCDC) TGR5 agonists enhanced afferent mechanosensitivity to bladder distension. Correspondingly, in vivo intravesical administration of CCDC increased the number of spinal dorsal horn neurons that were activated by bladder distension. The enhanced mechanosensitivity induced by CCDC ex vivo and in vivo was absent using Gpbar1-/- mice. Together, these results indicate a role for the TGR5 receptor in mediating bladder afferent hypersensitivity to distension and thus may be important to the symptoms associated with IC/BPS and OAB.","Administration, Intravesical;Animals;Bile Acids;Calcium;Cells;Cystitis, Interstitial;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypersensitivity;In Vitro;Irritants;Mediating;Mice;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Painful Bladder Syndrome;Play;Population;Posterior Horn Cells;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Role;Sensitivity;Sulfates;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Thought;Urinary Bladder;Urinary Bladder, Overactive;Urinary Retention;Viscera","Cystitis, Interstitial;Hypersensitivity;Painful Bladder Syndrome;Syndrome;Urinary Bladder, Overactive;Urinary Retention",Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35714327,2023,Sympathetic modulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nociception in the presence of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) causes more severe pain and psychological stress than other types of cancer. Despite clinical evidence linking pain, stress, and cancer progression, the underlying relationship between pain and sympathetic neurotransmission in oral cancer is unknown. We found that human HNSCC tumors and mouse tumor tissue are innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves. Moreover, β-adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors (β-ARs) are overexpressed in human oral cancer cell lines, and norepinephrine treatment increased β-AR2 protein expression as well as cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) signaling reduces oral cancer-induced nociceptive behavior. Norepinephrine-treated cancer cell lines secrete more TNFα which, when applied to tongue-innervating trigeminal neurons, evoked a larger Ca 2+ transient; TNF-TNFR inhibitor blocked the increase in the evoked Ca 2+ transient. Using an orthotopic xenograft oral cancer model, we found that mice demonstrated significantly less orofacial cancer-induced nociceptive behavior during systemic β-adrenergic inhibitory treatment with propranolol. Furthermore, chemical sympathectomy using guanethidine led to a significant reduction in tumor size and nociceptive behavior. We infer from these results that sympathetic signaling modulates oral cancer pain through TNFα secretion and tumorigenesis. Further investigation of the role of neurocancer communication in cancer progression and pain is warranted.","Adrenergic Agents;Animals;Behavior;Bodily Secretions;Cancer;Cancer of Mouth;Carcinogenesis;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell;Cell Line;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Proliferation;Communication;Guanethidine;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Heterografts;Humans;In Vitro;Mice;Mouth Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Neurons;Nociception;Norepinephrine;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain;Propranolol;Proteins;Role;Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck;Stress, Psychological;Sympathectomy, Chemical;Synaptic Transmission;Therapeutics;Tissues;Tongue;Transients;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Cancer;Cancer of Mouth;Carcinogenesis;Carcinoma, Squamous Cell;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Mouth Neoplasms;Necrosis;Neoplasms;Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Pain;Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35775484,2022,A nerve injury-specific long noncoding RNA promotes neuropathic pain by increasing Ccl2 expression.,"Maladaptive changes of nerve injury-associated genes in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are critical for neuropathic pain genesis. Emerging evidence supports the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene transcription. Here we identified a conserved lncRNA, named nerve injury-specific lncRNA (NIS-lncRNA) for its upregulation in injured DRGs exclusively in response to nerve injury. This upregulation was triggered by nerve injury-induced increase in DRG ELF1, a transcription factor that bound to the NIS-lncRNA promoter. Blocking this upregulation attenuated nerve injury-induced CCL2 increase in injured DRGs and nociceptive hypersensitivity during the development and maintenance periods of neuropathic pain. Mimicking NIS-lncRNA upregulation elevated CCL2 expression, increased CCL2-mediated excitability in DRG neurons, and produced neuropathic pain symptoms. Mechanistically, NIS-lncRNA recruited more binding of the RNA-interacting protein FUS to the Ccl2 promoter and augmented Ccl2 transcription in injured DRGs. Thus, NIS-lncRNA participates in neuropathic pain likely by promoting FUS-triggered DRG Ccl2 expression and may be a potential target in neuropathic pain management.","Cell Biology;Chemokine CCL2;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Epigenetics;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Maintenance;Nervous System Diseases;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurosciences;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Proteins;RNA;RNA, Long Noncoding;Role;Transcription Factors;Up-Regulation",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Nervous System Diseases;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,J Clin Invest,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35839339,2022,Enhanced nociceptive behavior and expansion of associated primary afferents in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy.,"Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia; the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 min at ~70%-80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4) was unaltered in HI kits, but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein was unchanged within spinal cord white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinal reflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.","Animals;Behavior;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cerebral Palsy;Cerebral Palsy, Spastic;Comorbidity;Female;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Hyperreflexia;Hypoxia;Injuries;Ischemia;Isolectins;Movement;Movement Disorders;New Zealand Rabbits;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Population;Pregnancy;Rabbits;Reflex;Sensation;Sensitivity;Spastic;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Surgical Procedures, Operative;White Matter","Cerebral Palsy;Cerebral Palsy, Spastic;Hyperreflexia;Hypoxia;Injuries;Ischemia;Movement Disorders;Pain;Spastic",J Neurosci Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36126728,2022,14-3-3γ mediates the long-term inhibition of peripheral kappa opioid receptor antinociceptive signaling by norbinaltorphimine.,"Long-term inhibition of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in peripheral pain-sensing neurons is a potential obstacle for development of peripherally-restricted KOR agonists that produce analgesia. Such a long-term inhibitory mechanism is invoked from activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that follows a single injection of the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). This effect requires protein synthesis of an unknown mediator in peripheral pain-sensing neurons. Using 2D difference gel electrophoresis with tandem mass spectrometry, we have identified that the scaffolding protein 14-3-3γ is upregulated in peripheral sensory neurons following activation of JNK with norBNI. Knockdown of 14-3-3γ by siRNA eliminates the long-term reduction in KOR-mediated cAMP signaling by norBNI in peripheral sensory neurons in culture. Similarly, knockdown of 14-3-3γ in the rat hind paw abolished the norBNI-mediated long-term reduction in peripheral KOR-mediated antinociception. Further, overexpression of 14-3-3γ in KOR expressing CHO cells prevented KOR-mediated inhibition of cAMP signaling. These long-term effects are selective for KOR as heterologous regulation of other receptor systems was not observed. These data suggest that 14-3-3γ is both necessary and sufficient for the long-term inhibition of KOR by norBNI in peripheral sensory neurons.","14-3-3 Proteins;Adenosine Monophosphate;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;CHO Cells;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Culture;Electrophoresis;Gels;Injections;JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Longterm Effects;Naltrexone;Neurons;Opioids;Pain;Proteins;RNA, Small Interfering;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Regulation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Pain,Neuropharmacology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36226379,2022,A narrative review of the calcitonin peptide family and associated receptors as migraine targets: Calcitonin gene-related peptide and beyond.,"To summarize the pharmacology of the calcitonin peptide family of receptors and explore their relationship to migraine and current migraine therapies. Therapeutics that dampen calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling are now in clinical use to prevent or treat migraine. However, CGRP belongs to a broader peptide family, including the peptides amylin and adrenomedullin. Receptors for this family are complex, displaying overlapping pharmacologic profiles. Despite the focus on CGRP and the CGRP receptor in migraine research, recent evidence implicates related peptides and receptors in migraine. This narrative review summarizes literature encompassing the current pharmacologic understanding of the calcitonin peptide family, and the evidence that links specific members of this family to migraine and migraine-like behaviors. Recent work links amylin and adrenomedullin to migraine-like behavior in rodent models and migraine-like attacks in individuals with migraine. We collate novel information that suggests females may be more sensitive to amylin and CGRP in the context of migraine-like behaviors. We report that drugs designed to antagonize the canonical CGRP receptor also antagonize a second CGRP-responsive receptor and speculate as to whether this influences therapeutic efficacy. We also discuss the specificity of current drugs with regards to CGRP isoforms and how this may influence therapeutic profiles. Lastly, we emphasize that receptors related to, but distinct from, the canonical CGRP receptor may represent underappreciated and novel drug targets. Multiple peptides within the calcitonin family have been linked to migraine. The current focus on CGRP and its canonical receptor may be obscuring pathways to further therapeutics. Drug discovery schemes that take a wider view of the receptor family may lead to the development of new anti-migraine drugs with favorable clinical profiles. We also propose that understanding these related peptides and receptors may improve our interpretation regarding the mechanism of action of current drugs.","Adrenomedullin;Behavior;Calcitonin;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Comprehension;Drug Discovery;Family;Female;Humans;Islet Amyloid Polypeptide;Lead;Literature;Migraine Disorders;News;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Protein Isoforms;Receptor Activity-Modifying Proteins;Receptors, Adrenomedullin;Receptors, Calcitonin;Receptors, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Report;Research;Review;Rodentia;Specificity;Therapeutics;Work",Migraine Disorders,Headache,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36257317,2022,Skeletal interoception in bone homeostasis and pain.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that interoception maintains proper physiological status and orchestrates metabolic homeostasis by regulating feeding behaviors, glucose balance, and lipid metabolism. Continuous skeletal remodeling consumes a tremendous amount of energy to provide skeletal scaffolding, support muscle movement, store vital minerals, and maintain a niche for hematopoiesis, which are processes that also contribute to overall metabolic balance. Although skeletal innervation has been described for centuries, recent work has shown that skeletal metabolism is tightly regulated by the nervous system and that skeletal interoception regulates bone homeostasis. Here, we provide a general discussion of interoception and its effects on the skeleton and whole-body metabolism. We also discuss skeletal interoception-mediated regulation in the context of pathological conditions and skeletal pain as well as future challenges to our understanding of these process and how they can be leveraged for more effective therapy.",Bones;Central Nervous System;Comprehension;Energy Metabolism;Feeding Behavior;Future;Glucose;Hematopoiesis;Homeostasis;Humans;Interoception;Lipid Metabolism;Metabolism;Minerals;Movement;Muscles;Nervous System;Overall;Pain;Regulation;Skeleton;Therapeutics;Work,Pain,Cell Metab,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

36343228,2022,Spinal neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor-expressing neurons are a pharmacotherapeutic target for the alleviation of neuropathic pain.,"Peripheral nerve injury sensitizes a complex network of spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) neurons to produce allodynia and neuropathic pain. The identification of a druggable target within this network has remained elusive, but a promising candidate is the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor-expressing interneuron (Y1-IN) population. We report that spared nerve injury (SNI) enhanced the excitability of Y1-INs and elicited allodynia (mechanical and cold hypersensitivity) and affective pain. Similarly, chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of Y1-INs in uninjured mice elicited behavioral signs of spontaneous, allodynic, and affective pain. SNI-induced allodynia was reduced by chemogenetic inhibition of Y1-INs, or intrathecal administration of a Y1-selective agonist. Conditional deletion of Npy1r in DH neurons, but not peripheral afferent neurons prevented the anti-hyperalgesic effects of the intrathecal Y1 agonist. We conclude that spinal Y1-INs are necessary and sufficient for the behavioral symptoms of neuropathic pain and represent a promising target for future pharmacotherapeutic development of Y1 agonists.","Administration;Allodynia;Animals;Behavioral Symptoms;Cold Temperature;Future;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Interneurons;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Neuropeptide Y;Optogenetics;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Population;Report;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn",Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36378744,2022,The contribution of endocytosis to sensitization of nociceptors and synaptic transmission in nociceptive circuits.,"Chronic pain involves sensitization of nociceptors and synaptic transmission of painful signals in nociceptive circuits in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We investigated the contribution of clathrin-dependent endocytosis to sensitization of nociceptors by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and to synaptic transmission in spinal nociceptive circuits. We determined whether therapeutic targeting of endocytosis could ameliorate pain. mRNA encoding dynamin (Dnm) 1 to 3 and adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), which mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis, were localized to primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia of mouse and human and to spinal neurons in the dorsal horn of the mouse spinal cord by RNAScope. When injected intrathecally to mice, Dnm and AAK1 siRNA or shRNA knocked down Dnm and AAK1 mRNA in dorsal root ganglia neurons, reversed mechanical and thermal allodynia and hyperalgesia, and normalized nonevoked behavior in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Intrathecally administered inhibitors of clathrin, Dnm, and AAK1 also reversed allodynia and hyperalgesia. Disruption of clathrin, Dnm, and AAK1 did not affect normal motor functions of behaviors. Patch clamp recordings of dorsal horn neurons revealed that Dnm1 and AAK1 disruption inhibited synaptic transmission between primary sensory neurons and neurons in lamina I/II of the spinal cord dorsal horn by suppressing release of synaptic vesicles from presynaptic primary afferent neurons. Patch clamp recordings from dorsal root ganglion nociceptors indicated that Dnm siRNA prevented sustained GPCR-mediated sensitization of nociceptors. By disrupting synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and blunting sensitization of nociceptors, endocytosis inhibitors offer a therapeutic approach for pain treatment.","Affect;Allodynia;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Clathrin;Dynamins;Endocytosis;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Lamina I;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Nociceptors;Pain;Posterior Horn Cells;Protein Kinases;RNA, Messenger;RNA, Small Interfering;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Sensory Receptor Cells;Short Hairpin RNA;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles;Therapeutics","Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Neuralgia;Pain",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
36460518,2022,"Effect of intrathecal NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides on neuropathic pain caused by nerve trauma, chemotherapy, or diabetes mellitus.","Blocking increased expression of nerve injury-specific long non-coding RNA (NIS-lncRNA) in injured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) through DRG microinjection of NIS-lncRNA small hairpin interfering RNA or generation of NIS-lncRNA knockdown mice mitigates neuropathic pain. However, these strategies are impractical in the clinic. This study employed a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antisense oligonucleotides strategy to examine the effect of NIS-lncRNA ASOs on neuropathic pain. Effects of intrathecal injection of NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides on day 7 or 14 after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, fourth lumbar (L4) spinal nerve ligation, or intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel or streptozotocin on the expression of DRG NIS-lncRNA and C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, an NIS-lncRNA downstream target) and nociceptive hypersensitivity were examined. We also assessed whether NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides produced cellular toxicity. Intrathecal NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides attenuated CCI-induced mechanical allodynia, heat hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia, and ongoing nociceptive responses, without changing basal or acute nociceptive responses and locomotor function. Intrathecal NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides also blocked CCI-induced increases in NIS-lncRNA and CCL2 in the ipsilateral L3 and L4 DRG and hyperactivities of neurones and astrocytes in the ipsilateral L3 and L4 spinal cord dorsal horn. Similar results were found in antisense oligonucleotides-treated mice after spinal nerve ligation or intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel or streptozotocin. Normal morphologic structure and no cell loss were observed in the DRG and spinal cord of antisense oligonucleotides-treated mice. These findings further validate the role of NIS-lncRNA in trauma-, chemotherapy-, or diabetes-induced neuropathic pain and demonstrate potential clinical application of NIS-lncRNA antisense oligonucleotides for neuropathic pain management.","Astrocytes;Cells;Chemokines, CC;Cold Temperature;Constriction;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Injections, Intrathecal;Injuries;Ligands;Ligation;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Microinjections;Neuralgia;Oligonucleotides, Antisense;Paclitaxel;RNA;RNA, Long Noncoding;Role;Sciatic Nerve;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Spinal Nerves;Streptozocin;United States Food and Drug Administration;Wounds and Injuries",Diabetes Mellitus;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Wounds and Injuries,Br J Anaesth,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

This single arm prospective study assessed feasibility by actual use of the app and acceptability by satisfaction with the app. We report preliminary data on change in migraine disability and headache days. The 51 participants completed PMR sessions on a mean of 13 ± 19 (0,82) days for the 90-day study period, lasting a median of 11 min (IQR 6.5, 17) each.

More frequent PMR use was associated with a higher odds of headache free days (p = 0.0148). Smartphone-based PMR introduced to patients who present to the ED for migraine is feasible and acceptable.

33690845,2021,Implementation of Individualized Pain Care Plans Decreases Length of Stay and Hospital Admission Rates for High Utilizing Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.,"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) face inconsistent effective analgesic management, leading to high inpatient healthcare utilization and significant financial burden for healthcare institutions. Current evidence does not provide guidance for inpatient management of acute pain in adults with sickle cell disease. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort quality improvement project to characterize the role of individualized care plans on improving patient care and reducing financial burden in high healthcare-utilizing patients with SCD-related pain. Individualized care plans were developed for patients with hospital admissions resulting from pain associated with sickle cell disease. A 2-year prospective longitudinal cohort quality improvement project was performed and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcome measure was duration of hospitalization. Secondary outcome measures included: pain intensity; 7, 30, and 90-day readmission rates; cost per day; total admissions; total cost per year; analgesic regimen at index admission; and discharge disposition. Duration of hospitalization, the primary outcome, significantly decreased by 1.23 days with no worsening of pain intensity scores. Seven-day readmission decreased by 34%. Use of intravenous hydromorphone significantly decreased by 25%. The potential cost saving was $1,398,827 as a result of this quality initiative. Implementation of individualized care plans reduced both admission rate and financial burden of high utilizing patients. Importantly, pain outcomes were not diminished. Results suggest that individualized care plans are a promising strategy for managing acute pain crisis in adult sickle cell patients from both care-focused and utilization outcomes.","Acute Pain;Adult;Analgesics;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cells;Cost;Cost Savings;Face;Health Care;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Hydromorphone;Index;Inpatients;Length of Stay;Outcome Measures;Pain;Patient Care;Patients;Prospective Studies;Quality Improvement;Retrospective Studies;Role","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Pain",Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35450155,2022,Disparities in telehealth utilization in patients with pain during COVID-19.,"The shift from in-person visits to telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges for patients with pain. Disparities in health care access already existed, and the impact of telehealth on these inequities has not been studied. To identify sociodemographic characteristics of patients with pain obtaining care through video, telephone, and in-person visits as social distancing restrictions evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our institutional clinical data warehouse, we identified 3314 patients with pain receiving care at a large academic institution in New York City during a baseline period (September 23, 2019-March 22, 2020) and counted telephone, video, and in-person visits during the following conditions: a shutdown period (March 23, 2020-May 23, 2020), when nonessential in-person visits were strictly limited, and a reopening period (May 23, 2020-September 23, 2020), when restrictions were relaxed and in-person visits were available. Patients were categorized into 4 groups based on the technology used to complete a visit: (1) video, (2) telephone, (3) in-person, and (4) no visit. Patients who were older, publicly insured, and identified as Black or Hispanic were overrepresented in the telephone visit group during shutdown and the in-person group during reopening. A video visit during shutdown increased the likelihood of continued video visit use during reopening despite the return of in-person visits. Results show differences in how patients with pain accessed clinical care in a socially distanced world and that flexibility in method of health care delivery may reduce barriers to access. Future research will identify factors (eg, Internet access, digital literacy, provider-patient relationships) driving heterogeneity in telehealth use in patients with pain.",Blacks;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Data Warehousing;Delivery of Health Care;Future;Health Care;Hispanics;Internet Access;Literacy;Methods;New York City;Pain;Patients;Persons;Physical Distancing;Pliability;Research;Technology;Telehealth;Telephone,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Pain,Pain Rep,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
27958381,2018,A polymorphism in the OPRM1 3'-untranslated region is associated with methadone efficacy in treating opioid dependence.,"The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target of methadone and buprenorphine. The primary neuronal transcript of the OPRM1 gene, MOR-1, contains a ~13 kb 3' untranslated region with five common haplotypes in European-Americans. We analyzed the effects of these haplotypes on the percentage of opioid positive urine tests in European-Americans (n=582) during a 24-week, randomized, open-label trial of methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) for the treatment of opioid dependence. A single haplotype, tagged by rs10485058, was significantly associated with patient urinalysis data in the methadone treatment group. Methadone patients with the A/A genotype at rs10485058 were less likely to have opioid-positive urine drug screens than those in the combined A/G and G/G genotypes group (relative risk=0.76, 95% confidence intervals=0.73-0.80, P=0.0064). Genotype at rs10485058 also predicted self-reported relapse rates in an independent population of Australian patients of European descent (n=1215) who were receiving opioid substitution therapy (P=0.003). In silico analysis predicted that miR-95-3p would interact with the G, but not the A allele of rs10485058. Luciferase assays indicated miR-95-3p decreased reporter activity of constructs containing the G, but not the A allele of rs10485058, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed pharmacogenetic effect. These findings suggest that selection of a medication for opioid dependence based on rs10485058 genotype might improve outcomes in this ethnic group.","3' Untranslated Regions;Adult;Alleles;Analgesics, Opioid;Australia;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Confidence Intervals;Ethnic Groups;Female;Genes;Genotype;Haplotypes;Humans;In Silico;Luciferases;Male;Methadone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Population;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Relapse;Relative Risk;Self;Suboxone;Therapeutics;Urinalysis;Urine;Whites",Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Pharmacogenomics J,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
28473233,2018,Relapse to opioid use disorder after inpatient treatment: Protective effect of injection naltrexone.,"Opioid use disorder is often treated with short term hospitalization and medically supervised withdrawal from opioids followed by counseling alone without medication assisted treatment (MAT). More evidence is needed to confirm the expectation that the rate of relapse would be high after short term inpatient treatment and withdrawal from opioids without follow-up MAT. To examine relapse to opioid use disorder in a randomized, multi-site effectiveness trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) vs community-based treatment as usual (TAU) without medication, as a function of the type of clinical service where treatment was initiated-short-term inpatient (N=59), long-term inpatient (N=48), or outpatient (N=201). Inpatients typically were admitted to treatment actively using opioids and had completed withdrawal from opioids before study entry. Outpatients typically presented already abstinent for varying periods of time. One month after randomization, relapse rates on TAU by setting were: short-term inpatient: 63%; long term inpatient: 14%; outpatient: 28%. On XR-NTX relapse rates after one month were low (&lt;12%) across all three settings. At the end of the 6 month trial, relapse rates on TAU were high across all treatment-initiation settings (short term inpatient 77%; long term inpatient 59%; outpatient 61%), while XR-NTX exerted a modest protective effect against relapse across settings (short term inpatient: 59%; long term inpatient 46%; outpatient 38%). Short term inpatient treatment is associated with a high rate of relapse among patients with opioid use disorder. These findings support the recommendation that medically supervised withdrawal from opioids should be followed by medication assisted treatment.","Adult;Community;Counseling;Expectations;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Injections;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Random Allocation;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
28513227,2018,Temporal Relationship of Sex Risk Behaviors and Substance Use Severity Among Men in Substance Use Treatment.,"Sex risk behaviors and substance use are intertwined. Many men continue to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors even when enrolled in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. We hypothesized that changes in sex risk behaviors would coincide with changes in drug/alcohol use severity among men in SUD treatment. During an HIV risk-reduction trial, men in methadone maintenance and outpatient drug-free treatment (N = 359) completed assessments at baseline and six months after. We assessed changes in sex risk and substance use severity, using the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite), controlling for treatment condition. In multinomial logistic regressions, decreased alcohol severity was significantly associated with decreases in reported sex partners, and increased alcohol severity was significantly associated with increases in reported sex partners. Increasing drug use severity was significantly associated with maintaining and initiating sex with a high-risk partner, while decreasing alcohol use severity was significantly associated with discontinuing sex under the influence. However, changes in drug/alcohol use severity were not associated with changes in unprotected sex. Substance use reductions may decrease HIV risk behaviors among male substance users. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating interventions in SUD treatment settings that address the intersection of sex risk behaviors and substance use.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Alcohols;Follow-Up Studies;HIV;HIV Infections;Humans;Index;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Male;Men;Methadone;Middle Aged;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Outpatients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Risk;Risk Behavior;Risk Reduction;Risk-Taking;Severity of Illness Index;Sex;Sexual Behavior;Sexual Partners;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Unsafe Sex;Young Adult",Alcohol-Related Disorders;HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Sex Res,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study evaluated whether smoking is predictive of virologic non-suppression (&gt; 200 copies/mL) and low CD4 count (&lt; 200 cells/mm3) during 1-year follow-up in medically hospitalized, substance-using PLHIV recruited for a multi-site trial. Smoking status was assessed with the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI). Analyses revealed that, controlling for baseline differences and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, non-smokers (n = 237), compared to smokers scoring in the medium-to-high range on the HSI (n = 386), were significantly more likely to achieve viral suppression (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02, 2.20). There was a significant smoking-by-time interaction for CD4 cell count (χ2(1) = 4.08, p &lt; .05), with smokers less likely to have low CD4 count at baseline and 6-month follow-up, but more likely to have low CD4 count at 12-month follow-up.

The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of a contingency management (CM) intervention targeting methamphetamine (MA) use on cigarette smoking. Sixty-one adults with MA-use disorders who were smokers were assigned to CM or standard psychosocial treatment. Rates of smoking-negative breath samples (carbon monoxide &lt;3 ppm) were compared between the two groups while controlling for baseline carbon monoxide level, marijuana use, MA use, and time. This subgroup of mostly male (59%) participants included 44 participants in the CM group and 17 participants in the standard psychosocial treatment. Tobacco smoking participants who received CM targeting MA use were 140% (odds ratio: 2.395; 95% confidence interval: 1.073-5.346) more likely to submit a smoking-negative breath sample relative to standard psychosocial treatment during the treatment period, holding constant several other prespecified covariates.

29150198,2018,"Comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid relapse prevention (X:BOT): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.","Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), a partial opioid agonist, are pharmacologically and conceptually distinct interventions to prevent opioid relapse. We aimed to estimate the difference in opioid relapse-free survival between XR-NTX and BUP-NX. We initiated this 24 week, open-label, randomised controlled, comparative effectiveness trial at eight US community-based inpatient services and followed up participants as outpatients. Participants were 18 years or older, had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 opioid use disorder, and had used non-prescribed opioids in the past 30 days. We stratified participants by treatment site and opioid use severity and used a web-based permuted block design with random equally weighted block sizes of four and six for randomisation (1:1) to receive XR-NTX or BUP-NX. XR-NTX was monthly intramuscular injections (Vivitrol; Alkermes) and BUP-NX was daily self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone; Indivior). The primary outcome was opioid relapse-free survival during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Relapse was 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use by urine toxicology or self-report, or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02032433. Between Jan 30, 2014, and May 25, 2016, we randomly assigned 570 participants to receive XR-NTX (n=283) or BUP-NX (n=287). The last follow-up visit was Jan 31, 2017. As expected, XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle: fewer participants successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 [72%] of 283) than BUP-NX (270 [94%] of 287; p&lt;0·0001). Among all participants who were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat population, n=570) 24 week relapse events were greater for XR-NTX (185 [65%] of 283) than for BUP-NX (163 [57%] of 287; hazard ratio [HR] 1·36, 95% CI 1·10-1·68), most or all of this difference accounted for by early relapse in nearly all (70 [89%] of 79) XR-NTX induction failures. Among participants successfully inducted (per-protocol population, n=474), 24 week relapse events were similar across study groups (p=0·44). Opioid-negative urine samples (p&lt;0·0001) and opioid-abstinent days (p&lt;0·0001) favoured BUP-NX compared with XR-NTX among the intention-to-treat population, but were similar across study groups among the per-protocol population. Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p=0·0012), then converged by week 24 (p=0·20). With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions, treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose did not differ between treatment groups. Five fatal overdoses occurred (two in the XR-NTX group and three in the BUP-NX group). In this population it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than BUP-NX, and this negatively affected overall relapse. However, once initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective. Future work should focus on facilitating induction to XR-NTX and on improving treatment retention for both medications.

29174306,2018,Sex and gender differences in substance use disorders.,"The gender gap in substance use disorders (SUDs), characterized by greater prevalence in men, is narrowing, highlighting the importance of understanding sex and gender differences in SUD etiology and maintenance. In this critical review, we provide an overview of sex/gender differences in the biology, epidemiology and treatment of SUDs. Biological sex differences are evident across an array of systems, including brain structure and function, endocrine function, and metabolic function. Gender (i.e., environmentally and socioculturally defined roles for men and women) also contributes to the initiation and course of substance use and SUDs. Adverse medical, psychiatric, and functional consequences associated with SUDs are often more severe in women. However, men and women do not substantively differ with respect to SUD treatment outcomes. Although several trends are beginning to emerge in the literature, findings on sex and gender differences in SUDs are complicated by the interacting contributions of biological and environmental factors. Future research is needed to further elucidate sex and gender differences, especially focusing on hormonal factors in SUD course and treatment outcomes; research translating findings between animal and human models; and gender differences in understudied populations, such as those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders and gender-specific populations, such as pregnant women.",Animals;Biology;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;Comprehension;Epidemiology;Female;Future;Gender;Humans;Literature;Maintenance;Male;Men;Mental Disorders;Population;Pregnant Women;Prevalence;Research;Respect;Review;Risk Factors;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Translating;Treatment Outcome;Women,Mental Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Clin Psychol Rev,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Performance on cognitive measures at baseline was compared across 5 primary substance subgroups of individuals (alcohol = 104; cocaine = 102; stimulants = 69; opioids = 108; marijuana = 114) enrolled in a web-based psychosocial treatment study conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. MicroCog subtests were used to assess cognitive domains of attention and mental control, reasoning and cognitive flexibility, and spatial processing. The average age of onset for a substance use disorder was early to mid-20s, with marijuana users reporting the earliest age of onset (mean 19.9, SD 7.5) and stimulant users reporting the latest (mean 25.2, SD 9.9). Among the total sample, half (49.7%) demonstrated impairment in cognitive flexibility and reasoning, and over one-third (37.3%) had impairment in verbal learning and memory. Stimulant (37.68%) and cocaine (34.31%) users showed significantly greater clinical impairment in attention and mental control compared with alcohol users (17.31%) and opioid (21.30%) users (stimulant subgroup only) (χ [4] = 10.97, P = 0.027). Cocaine users showed the greatest overall impairment across total and proficiency subtest scores, although these were not statistically different from other subgroups. These findings confirmed previous studies, indicating a high prevalence of significant cognitive dysfunction across all substance use categories among treatment-seeking adults, and found that cocaine use appears to be associated with the most impairment. Increasing knowledge of similarities and differences between primary substance subgroups can help guide substance use disorder treatment planning.",Adolescent;Adult;Age of Onset;Alcohols;Attention;Cannabis;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Cognitive Dysfunction;Community;Counseling;Drug Abuse;Female;Humans;Internet;Knowledge;Logistic Models;Male;Measures;Memory;MicroCog;Neuropsychological Tests;Opioids;Overall;Pliability;Prevalence;Self Report;Spatial Processing;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Verbal Learning;Young Adult,Cognitive Dysfunction;Drug Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We also performed multinomial logistic regressions to identify key characteristics associated with class membership. We identified 5 classes of substance users (minimal drug users, cocaine users, substantial cocaine/hazardous alcohol users, problem polysubstance users, substantial cocaine/heroin users) and 3 classes of arrest history (minimal arrests, non-drug arrests, drug-related arrests). While several demographic variables such as age and being Black or Hispanic were associated with class membership for some of the latent classes, participation in substance use treatment was the only covariate that was significantly associated with membership in all classes in both substance use and arrest history LCA models. Our analyses reveal complex patterns of behaviors among substance using PLWH and suggest that HIV intervention strategies may need to take into consideration such nuanced differences to better inform future studies and program implementation.",Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Adult;Alcohols;Behavior;Blacks;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Criminal Justice;Demography;Drug Users;Female;Future;HIV;HIV Infections;Heroin;Hispanics;History;Hope;Humans;Latent Class Analysis;Law Enforcement;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Needs;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;HIV Infections;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,AIDS Behav,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
29325238,2018,Psychometrics of the Self-Report Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking Scale (CAST-SR): Results From the STRIDE (CTN-0037) Study.,"The self-report Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking Scale (CAST-SR) was developed to track mania, irritability, anxiety, panic, and insomnia symptoms among depressed outpatients receiving antidepressant medication. Given the overlap between these domains, depression, and stimulant use disorders, we reexamined CAST-SR psychometrics in a novel sample: individuals with stimulant use disorder receiving aerobic exercise or health education interventions. Using the subsample of stimulant-dependent (following DSM-IV criteria) individuals prescribed antidepressants (N = 124) from the multisite Stimulant Reduction Intervention Using Dosed Exercise (CTN-0037) trial (total sample N = 302), conducted July 2010 to February 2013, we analyzed CAST-SR data collected at the first assessment after participant's discharge from residential treatment. We also evaluated the convergent/discriminant validity of the CAST-SR with several self-report questionnaires. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 12-item measure composed of 4 factors: irritability, anxiety, panic, and insomnia. This factor structure loaded only in participants prescribed antidepressant medication, not in those who were not prescribed antidepressants. These results replicate the original CAST-SR factor structure, except for the mania factor, which failed to load. Internal consistency was high (α = 0.92 for total scale and α = 0.78-0.89 for the 4 factors), and convergent validity was established, especially for the insomnia and irritability factors, alongside the total score with depressive symptoms, insomnia, quality of life, suicide risk, and physical health measures. These results demonstrate the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the CAST-SR in a novel population of only individuals with stimulant use disorders receiving both exercise/health education interventions and antidepressant medication.

The aim of this study was to improve understanding of the profile of treatment-seeking crack-dependent individuals. We recruited 65 crack-dependent individuals from among those seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic for alcohol and drug treatment in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Assessments, conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, focused on sociodemographic characteristics, the pattern/history of crack use, treatment history, concomitant substance use disorders, psychiatric symptomatology, and impulsivity. In the study sample, males predominated, as did unemployment, homelessness, and low levels of education. On average, the participants had smoked crack for 10 years. Most had previously been treated for crack dependence. Concomitant DSM-IV diagnoses of dependence on other substances were common, dependence on tobacco and alcohol being the most prevalent. Participants presented significant psychiatric symptomatology and impulsivity, with nearly half of the sample presenting psychotic symptoms, 90% presenting depressive symptoms, and 80% presenting anxiety symptoms.

29628018,2018,"Barriers and facilitators affecting the implementation of substance use screening in primary care clinics: a qualitative study of patients, providers, and staff.","Alcohol and drug use are leading causes of morbidity and mortality that frequently go unidentified in medical settings. As part of a multi-phase study to implement electronic health record-integrated substance use screening in primary care clinics, we interviewed key clinical stakeholders to identify current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for its implementation. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 67 stakeholders, including patients, primary care providers (faculty and resident physicians), nurses, and medical assistants, in two urban academic health systems. Themes were identified using an inductive approach, revised through an iterative process, and mapped to the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, which guides the implementation of new clinical practices (Graham et al. in J Contin Educ Health Prof 26(1):13-24, 2006). Factors affecting implementation based on KTA elements were identified from participant narratives. Identifying the problem: Participants consistently agreed that having knowledge of a patient's substance use is important because of its impacts on health and medical care, that substance use is not properly identified in medical settings currently, and that universal screening is the best approach. Assessing barriers: Patients expressed concerns about consequences of disclosing substance use, confidentiality, and the individual's own reluctance to acknowledge a substance use problem. Barriers identified by providers included individual-level factors such as lack of clinical knowledge and training, as well as systems-level factors including time pressure, resources, lack of space, and difficulty accessing addiction treatment. Adapting to the local context: Most patients and providers stated that the primary care provider should play a key role in substance use screening and interventions. Opinions diverged regarding the optimal approach to delivering screening, although most preferred a patient self-administered approach. Many providers reported that taking effective action once unhealthy substance use is identified is crucial. Participants expressed support for substance use screening as a valuable part of medical care, and identified individual-level as well as systems-level barriers to its implementation. These findings suggest that screening programs should clearly communicate the goals of screening to patients and proactively counteract stigma, address staff concerns regarding time and workflow, and provide education as well as treatment resources to primary care providers.","Academic Medical Centers;Address;Adult;Aged;Alcohol Abuse;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Attitude of Health Personnel;Confidentiality;Drug Abuse;Education;Electronic Health Records;Elements;Faculty;Female;Focus Groups;Goals;Health;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Inservice Training;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Knowledge;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Mortality;New York City;News;Nurses;Opinions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Play;Pressure;Primary Health Care;Program;Psychotherapy, Brief;Qualitative Research;Referral and Consultation;Resources;Role;Screening;Self;Socioeconomic Factors;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Urban Population;Workflow",Alcohol Abuse;Alcoholism;Drug Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
29635217,2018,"Prevalence, patterns, and correlates of multiple substance use disorders among adult primary care patients.","Addressing multiple substance use disorders (SUDs) in primary care-based screening and intervention may improve SUD treatment access, engagement, and outcomes. To inform such efforts, research is needed on the prevalence and patterns of multiple SUDs among primary care patients. Data were analyzed from a sample of 2000 adult (aged ≥ 18) primary care patients recruited for a multisite National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study (CTN-0059). Past-year DSM-5 SUDs (tobacco, alcohol, and drug) were assessed by the modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Prevalence and correlates of multiple versus single SUDs were examined. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to explore patterns of multiple SUDs. Multiple SUDs were found among the majority of participants with SUD for alcohol, cannabis, prescription opioids, cocaine, and heroin. Participants who were male, ages 26-34, less educated, and unemployed had increased odds of multiple SUDs compared to one SUD. Having multiple SUDs was associated with greater severity of tobacco or alcohol use disorder. LCA of the sample identified three classes: class 1 (83.7%) exhibited low prevalence of all SUDs; class 2 (12.0%) had high-moderate prevalence of SUDs for tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis; class 3 (4.3%) showed high prevalence of SUD for tobacco, opioids, and cocaine. LCA-defined classes were distinguished by sex, age, race, education, and employment status. Findings suggest that primary care physicians should be aware of multiple SUDs when planning treatment, especially among adults who are male, younger, less educated, or unemployed. Interventions that target multiple SUDs warrant future investigation.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Cannabis;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Comorbidity;Drug Abuse;Education;Employment Status;Female;Future;Heroin;Humans;Interview;Latent Class Analysis;Male;Middle Aged;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians, Primary Care;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Research;Screening;Sex;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Young Adult",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
29672167,2018,Sex differences in opioid use and medical issues during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment.,"There are sex differences in buprenorphine/naloxone clinical trials for opioid use. While women have fewer opioid-positive urine samples, relative to men, a significant decrease in opioid-positive samples was found during treatment for men, but not women. In order to inform sex-based approaches to improve treatment outcomes, research is needed to determine if opioid use, and predictors of opioid use, differs between men and women during treatment. To test for sex differences in opioid use during a buprenorphine/naloxone clinical trial and determine if sex differences exist in the associations between addiction-related problem areas and opioid use over the course of the trial. This secondary data analysis of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) 0003 examined sex differences (men = 347, women = 169) in opioid-positive samples in a randomized clinical trial comparing 7-day vs. 28-day buprenorphine/naloxone tapering strategies. Addiction-related problem areas were defined by Addiction Severity-Lite (ASI-L) domain composite scores. Women were more likely than men to use opioids during the course of the buprenorphine/naloxone clinical trial (B = .33, p = .01) and medical issues were positively related to submitting an opioid-positive sample during treatment for women (B = 1.67, p = .01). No ASI-L domain composite score was associated with opioid-positive samples during treatment for men. Women were more likely than men to use opioids during the course of the buprenorphine/naloxone clinical trial, and medical issues predicted opioid use during treatment for women but not men.

29900624,2019,What defines a clinically meaningful outcome in the treatment of substance use disorders: reductions in direct consequences of drug use or improvement in overall functioning?,"Sustained abstinence is currently the only accepted end-point for pharmacotherapy trials for most substance use disorders (SUD), with the exception of alcohol. Despite recent efforts, the identification of a non-abstinence alternative as a clinically meaningful end-point for drug use trials has been elusive. The current standard for establishing a clinically meaningful outcome in SUD trials is to demonstrate that a reduction in drug use is associated with improvement in long-term functioning, but data indicate relatively weak associations between drug use and various psychosocial problem domains. This may be because assessments used most commonly to measure an individual's functioning do not specify whether aspects of functioning are a direct consequence of drug use. The acceptance of a non-abstinence-based end-point for alcohol use disorder trials was supported in part through associations with reductions in alcohol-related consequences, although measures designed to assess the direct consequences of drug use are rarely included in drug treatment efficacy trials. The field of substance use disorders should include measures of negative psychosocial and health consequences of drug use, as opposed to overall functioning, in the effort to establish meaningful non-abstinence-based end-points.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohols;Association;Drug Therapy;Health;Humans;Index;Inventories;Measures;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Outcome",Alcohol Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
29914717,2018,Future directions for medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder with American Indian/Alaska Natives.,"The U.S. is experiencing an alarming opioid epidemic, and although American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are especially hard hit, there is a paucity of opioid-related treatment research with these communities. AI/ANs are second only to Whites in the U.S. for overdose mortality. Thus, the National Institute on Drug Abuse convened a meeting of key stakeholders to elicit feedback on the acceptability and uptake of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders (OUDs) among AI/ANs. Five themes from this one-day meeting emerged: 1) the mismatch between Western secular and reductionistic medicine and the AI/AN holistic healing tradition; 2) the need to integrate MAT into AI/AN traditional healing; 3) the conflict between standardized MAT delivery and the traditional AI/AN desire for healing to include being medicine free; 4) systemic barriers; and 5) the need to improve research with AI/ANs using culturally relevant methods. Discussion is organized around key implementation strategies informed by these themes and necessary for the successful adoption of MAT in AI/AN communities: 1) type of medication; 2) educational interventions; 3) coordination of care; and 4) adjunctive psychosocial counseling. Using a community-based participatory research approach is consistent with a ""two eyed seeing"" approach that integrates Western and Indigenous worldviews. Such an approach is needed to develop impactful research in collaboration with AI/AN communities to address OUD health disparities.","Address;Adoption;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Community;Community-Based Participatory Research;Congresses as Topic;Counseling;Culturally Competent Care;Delivery of Health Care;Feedback;Future;Health;Health Status Disparities;Healthcare Disparities;Humans;Indians, North American;Medicine;Medicine, Traditional;Methods;Mortality;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Research;Stakeholder Participation;Therapeutics;Whites",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Behav,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30094695,2018,Correlates of Long-Term Opioid Abstinence After Randomization to Methadone Versus Buprenorphine/Naloxone in a Multi-Site Trial.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition with severe negative health consequences. Previous studies have reported that 5-year opioid abstinence is a good predictor of reduced likelihoods of relapse, but factors that shape long-term opioid abstinence are poorly understood. The present study is based on data from a prospective study of 699 adults with OUD who had been randomized to either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone and who were followed for at least 5 years. During the 5 years prior to the participants' last follow-up interview, 232 (33.2%) had achieved 5-year abstinence from heroin. Of those 232, 145 (20.7% of the total) had remained abstinent from both heroin and other opioids (e.g., hydrocodone, oxycodone, other opioid analgesics, excluding methadone or buprenorphine). Compared to non-abstinent individuals, those in both categories of opioid abstinence had lower problem severity in health and social functioning at the final follow-up. Logistic regression results indicated that cocaine users and injection drug users were less likely to achieve 5-year heroin abstinence, whereas Hispanics (vs. whites) and those treated in clinics on the West Coast (vs. East) were less likely to achieve 5-year abstinence from heroin and other opioids. For both abstinence category groups, abstinence was positively associated with older age at first opioid use, lower impulsivity, longer duration of treatment for OUD, and greater social support. Reducing cocaine use and injection drug use and increasing social support and retention in treatment may help maintain long-term abstinence from opioids among individuals treated with agonist pharmacotherapy.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Cocaine;Drug Therapy;Drug Users;Duration of Therapy;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Health;Heroin;Hispanics;Humans;Hydrocodone;Impulsive Behavior;Injections;Interview;Logistic Regression;Male;Methadone;Middle Aged;Naloxone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prospective Studies;Random Allocation;Relapse;Social Functioning;Social Support;Therapeutics;Time Factors;Whites;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Participants (N = 570) provided demographic, substance use, and psychiatric information. Women were significantly younger, more likely to identify as bisexual, live with a sexual partner, be financially dependent, and less likely employed. Women reported significantly greater psychiatric comorbidity and risk behaviors, shorter duration but similar age of onset of opioid use.

30157815,2018,National trends and characteristics of inpatient detoxification for drug use disorders in the United States.,"Prior studies indicate that the opportunity from detoxification to engage in subsequent drug use disorder (DUD) treatment may be missed. This study examined national trends and characteristics of inpatient detoxification for DUDs and explored factors associated with receiving DUD treatment (i.e., inpatient drug detoxification plus rehabilitation) and discharges against medical advice (DAMA). We analyzed inpatient hospitalization data involving the drug detoxification procedure for patients aged≥12 years (n = 271,403) in the 2003-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Samples. We compared the estimated rate and characteristics of inpatient drug-detoxification hospitalizations between 2003 and 2011 and determined demographic and clinical correlates of inpatient drug detoxification plus rehabilitation (versus detoxification-only) and DAMA (versus transfer to further treatment). There was no significant yearly change in the population rate of inpatient drug-detoxification hospitalizations during 2003-2011. The majority of inpatient drug detoxification were patients aged 35-64 years, males, and those on Medicaid. Among inpatient drug-detoxification hospitalizations, only 13% received detoxification plus rehabilitation during inpatient care, and up to 14% were DAMA; the most commonly identified diagnoses were opioid use disorder (OUD; 75%) and non-addiction mental health disorders (48%). Being on Medicaid (vs. having private insurance) and having OUD (vs. no OUD) were associated with decreased odds of receiving detoxification plus rehabilitation, as well as increased odds of DAMA. These findings suggest the presence of a potentially large detoxification-treatment gap for inpatient detoxification patients. They highlight the need for implementing DUD services to improve engagement in receiving further DUD treatment in order to improve recovery and health outcomes.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Child;Demography;Diagnosis;Drug Use Disorders;Female;Health;Hospitalization;Humans;Inactivation, Metabolic;Inpatients;Insurance;Male;Medicaid;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Procedures;Rehabilitation;Risk Factors;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Treatment Refusal;United States;Young Adult",Drug Use Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance-Related Disorders,BMC Public Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The process evaluation used a logic model, focusing on program inputs, activities, and outputs, to understand the services received by the initial 18 clients who entered treatment. Outcomes for these patients were not assessed. Results indicated that clients received a variety of services: On average clients contracted for 118 treatment sessions and received 143 sessions. Among the many types of services provided, the most frequently received were integrative healthcare (averaging 42 sessions), group therapy (32 sessions), and individual therapy (32 sessions).

30243412,2018,"How patient navigators view the use of financial incentives to influence study involvement, substance use, and HIV treatment.","While patient navigation has been shown to be an effective approach for linking persons to HIV care, and contingency management is effective at improving substance use-related outcomes, Project HOPE combined these two interventions in a novel way to engage HIV-positive patients with HIV and substance use treatment. The aims of this paper are to examine patient navigator views regarding how contingency management interacted with and affected their navigation process. Semi-structured qualitative interviews. 22 patient navigators from the original 10 Project HOPE study sites. Individual, semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 60 min addressed the patient navigator's professional background, descriptions of the participant population, substance use disorder versus HIV treatment entry and engagement issues, and the use of contingency management within the navigation service delivery protocol. Patient navigators believed that financial incentives helped motivate participant attendance at navigation sessions, particularly early in study involvement, which helped them to establish rapport and develop relationships with participants. Patient navigators often noted that financial incentives positively influenced targeted HIV health-related behaviors, such as attending medical appointments, which provided a rapid pay-off with an escalating sum. Contingency management was more complex when used by the patient navigators for substance use-related behaviors, particularly when incentives revolved around negative urine screening. Patient navigators noted that not all participants responded the same way to the contingency management and that the incentives were particularly helpful when participants were financially strained with limited resources or when internal motivation was lacking.

30243413,2018,Access to treatment for alcohol use disorders following Oregon's health care reforms and Medicaid expansion.,"The study examines impacts of delivery system reforms and Medicaid expansion on treatment for alcohol use disorders within the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid). Diagnoses, services and pharmacy claims related to alcohol use disorders were extracted from Medicaid encounter data. Logistic regression and interrupted time series analyses assessed the percent with alcohol use disorder entering care and the percent receiving pharmacotherapy before (January 2010-June 2012) and after (January 2013-June 2015) the initiation of Oregon's Coordinated Care Organization (CCO) model (July 2012-December 2012). Analyses also examined changes in access following Medicaid expansion (January 2014). Treatment entry rates increased from 35% in 2010 to 41% in 2015 following the introduction of CCOs and Medicaid expansion. The number of Medicaid enrollees with a diagnosed alcohol use disorder increased about 150% from 10,360 (2013) to 25,454 (2014) following Medicaid expansion. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder who were prescribed a medication to support recovery increased from 2.3% (2010) to 3.8% (2015). In Oregon, Medicaid expansion and health care reforms enhanced access and improved treatment initiation for alcohol use disorders.","Access to Therapy;Adolescent;Adult;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Diagnosis;Drug Therapy;Female;Health;Health Care Reform;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Oregon;Organizations;Pharmacy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30318376,2019,A Quality Framework for Emergency Department Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.,"Emergency clinicians are on the front lines of responding to the opioid epidemic and are leading innovations to reduce opioid overdose deaths through safer prescribing, harm reduction, and improved linkage to outpatient treatment. Currently, there are no nationally recognized quality measures or best practices to guide emergency department quality improvement efforts, implementation science researchers, or policymakers seeking to reduce opioid-associated morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, in May 2017, the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Center for the Clinical Trials Network convened experts in quality measurement from the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP's) Clinical Emergency Data Registry, researchers in emergency and addiction medicine, and representatives from federal agencies, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Drawing from discussions at this meeting and with experts in opioid use disorder treatment and quality measure development, we developed a multistakeholder quality improvement framework with specific structural, process, and outcome measures to guide an emergency medicine agenda for opioid use disorder policy, research, and clinical quality improvement.","Addiction Medicine;Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Best Practices;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.;Clinical Trial;Consensus;Death;Drawing;Drug Overdose;Emergencies;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Harm Reduction;Humans;Implementation Science;Measures;Morbidity;Mortality;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Outpatients;Patient Care;Physicians;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Quality Improvement;Registries;Research;Research Personnel;Therapeutics;United States",Death;Drug Abuse;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Ann Emerg Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30336703,2019,"A Randomized Trial Comparing Extended-Release Injectable Suspension and Oral Naltrexone, Both Combined With Behavioral Therapy, for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.","The oral formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone has shown limited effectiveness for treatment of opioid use disorder due to poor adherence. Long-acting injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone), administered monthly, circumvents the need for daily pill taking, potentially improving adherence, and has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing opioid use over 6 months of treatment. This open-label trial compared the outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder treated with XR-naltrexone or oral naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy. Sixty opioid-dependent adults completed inpatient opioid withdrawal and were transitioned to oral naltrexone. They were stratified by severity of opioid use (six or fewer bags versus more than six bags of heroin per day) and randomly assigned (1:1) to continue treatment with oral naltrexone (N=32) or XR-naltrexone (N=28) for 24 weeks. The first dose of XR-naltrexone (380 mg) was administered prior to discharge, with monthly doses thereafter, and oral naltrexone was given in a 50-mg daily dose. All participants received weekly behavioral therapy to support treatment and adherence to naltrexone. A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for race, gender, route of use, and baseline opioid use severity indicated that significantly more patients were retained in treatment for 6 months in the XR-naltrexone group (16 of 28 patients, 57.1%) than in the oral naltrexone group (nine of 32 patients, 28.1%) (hazard ratio=2.18, 95% CI=1.07, 4.43). Patients receiving XR-naltrexone had twice the rate of treatment retention at 6 months compared with those taking oral naltrexone. These results support the use of XR-naltrexone combined with behavioral therapy as an effective treatment for patients seeking opioid withdrawal and nonagonist treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder.","Administration, Oral;Adult;Behavior Therapy;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Delayed-Action Preparations;Female;Gender;Heroin;Humans;Injectables;Injections;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Male;Medication Adherence;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Placebos;Racial Stocks;Recurrence;Relapse;Suspensions;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Relapse,Am J Psychiatry,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30452209,2018,Cost of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorders following inpatient detoxification.,"To estimate the costs of providing extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) and buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) following inpatient detoxification using data derived from a multisite randomized controlled trial at 8 US community-based treatment programs. Cost data were collected for 3 intervention phases: program start-up, inpatient detoxification, and up to 24 weeks of medication induction and management visits (post detoxification). Cost analyses were from the healthcare sector perspective (2015 US$); patient costs are also reported. We conducted site visits, administered a cost survey to treatment programs, and analyzed study data on medication and services utilization. Nationally representative sources were used to estimate unit costs. Uncertainty was evaluated in sensitivity analyses. Mean start-up costs were $1071 per program for XR-NTX and $828 per program for BUP-NX. Mean costs per participant were $5416 for XR-NTX (57% detoxification, 37% medication, 3% provider, 3% patient) and $4148 for BUP-NX (64% detoxification, 12% medication, 10% provider, 14% patient). Total cost per participant ranged by site from $2979 to $8963 for XR-NTX and from $2521 to $6486 for BUP-NX. For treatment providers, offering XR-NTX and/or BUP-NX as part of existing detoxification treatment modalities generates modest costs in addition to the costs of detoxification, which vary substantially among the 8 sites. From the patient's perspective, the costs associated with medication management visits may be a barrier for some individuals considering these treatments.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Community;Cost;Cost Analysis;Costs and Cost Analysis;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Therapy;Health Care Sector;Humans;Injectables;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Program;Randomized Controlled Trial;Recurrence;Sensitivity;Services Utilization;Surveys;Therapeutics;Uncertainty;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence,Am J Manag Care,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

30513477,2019,Prevalence and patterns of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder among primary care patients who use tobacco.,"Current data suggest that opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (OUD) may be over represented among tobacco users. However, this association remains understudied in primary care settings. A better understanding of the extent of heterogeneity in opioid misuse among primary care patients who use tobacco may have implications for improved primary care-based screening, prevention, and intervention approaches. Data were derived from a sample of 2000 adult (aged ≥18) primary care patients across 5 distinct clinics. Among past-year tobacco users (n = 882), we assessed the prevalence of opioid misuse and OUD by sociodemographic characteristics and past-year polysubstance use. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify heterogeneous subgroups of tobacco users according to past-year polysubstance use patterns. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine variables associated with LCA-defined class membership. Past-year tobacco use was reported by &gt;84% of participants who reported past-year opioid misuse or OUD. Among those reporting past-year tobacco use, the prevalence of past-year opioid misuse and OUD was 14.0% and 9.5%, respectively. The prevalence of opioid misuse or OUD was highest among tobacco users who were male or unemployed. Three LCA-defined classes among tobacco users were identified including a tobacco-minimal drug use group (78.0%), a tobacco-cannabis use group (10.1%), and a tobacco-opioid/polydrug use group (11.9%). Class membership differed by sociodemographic characteristics. Results from this study support the benefit of more comprehensive assessment of and/or monitoring for opioid misuse among primary care patients who use tobacco, particularly for those who are male, unemployed, or polydrug users.",Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Association;Cannabis;Comprehension;Female;Humans;Latent Class Analysis;Logistic Regression;Male;Marijuana Smoking;Middle Aged;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Screening;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Young Adult,Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30557443,2019,Cost-Effectiveness of Buprenorphine-Naloxone Versus Extended-Release Naltrexone to Prevent Opioid Relapse.,"Not enough evidence exists to compare buprenorphine-naloxone with extended-release naltrexone for treating opioid use disorder. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone. Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a previously reported randomized clinical trial of 570 adults in 8 U.S. inpatient or residential treatment programs. Study instruments. Adults with opioid use disorder. 24-week intervention with an additional 12 weeks of observation. Health care sector and societal. Buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone. Incremental costs combined with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental time abstinent from opioids. Use of the health care sector perspective and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY showed buprenorphine-naloxone to be preferable to extended-release naltrexone in 97% of bootstrap replications at 24 weeks and in 85% at 36 weeks. Similar results were obtained with incremental time abstinent from opioids as an outcome and with use of the societal perspective. The base-case results were sensitive to the cost of the 2 treatments and the success of randomized treatment initiation. Relatively short follow-up for a chronic condition, substantial missing data, no information on patient out-of-pocket and social service costs. Buprenorphine-naloxone is preferred to extended-release naltrexone as first-line treatment when both options are clinically appropriate and patients require detoxification before initiating extended-release naltrexone.

30763292,2019,Clinical and Sociobehavioral Prediction Model of 30-Day Hospital Readmissions Among People With HIV and Substance Use Disorder: Beyond Electronic Health Record Data.,"Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals receive reduced reimbursements for excessive 30-day readmissions. However, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not consider social and behavioral variables in expected readmission rate calculations, which may unfairly penalize systems caring for socially disadvantaged patients, including patients with HIV. Randomized controlled trial of patient navigation with or without financial incentives in HIV-positive substance users recruited from the inpatient setting at 11 US hospitals. External validation of an existing 30-day readmission prediction model, using variables available in the electronic health record (EHR-only model), in a new multicenter cohort of HIV-positive substance users was assessed by C-statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow testing. A second model evaluated sociobehavioral factors in improving the prediction model (EHR-plus model) using multivariable regression and C-statistic with cross-validation. The mean age of the cohort was 44.1 years, and participants were predominantly males (67.4%), non-white (88.0%), and poor (62.8%, &lt;$20,000/year). Overall, 17.5% individuals had a hospital readmission within 30 days of initial hospital discharge. The EHR-only model resulted in a C-statistic of 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.70). Inclusion of additional sociobehavioral variables, food insecurity and readiness for substance use treatment, in the EHR-plus model resulted in a C-statistic of 0.74 (0.71 after cross-validation, 95% confidence interval: 0.64 to 0.77). Incorporation of detailed social and behavioral variables substantially improved the performance of a 30-day readmission prediction model for hospitalized HIV-positive substance users. Our findings highlight the importance of social determinants in readmission risk and the need to ask about, adjust for, and address them.","Address;Adult;Caring;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Disadvantaged;Electronic Health Records;Female;Food Insecurity;HIV;HIV Infections;Hospital Readmissions;Hospitals;Humans;Incentives;Inpatients;Male;Models, Theoretical;Needs;News;Overall;Patient Navigation;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;Patient Readmission;Patients;Persons;Randomized Controlled Trial;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Statistics;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time Factors;United States;Whites",HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30802735,2019,Discharge against medical advice from hospitalizations for substance use disorders: The potential impact of the Affordable Care Act.,"To explore whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enactment is associated with changes in the proportion of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) among hospitalizations due to substance use disorders (SUDs). Data were drawn from the 2012-2015 National Inpatient Samples. The sample comprised hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of SUD (i.e., SUD-involved hospitalization) for patients aged 18-64 years (unweighted N = 287,629). Interrupted time series analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of the ACA on monthly proportions of DAMA among SUD-involved hospitalizations. Overall, approximately 11% of SUD-involved hospitalizations were DAMA. DAMA was most frequently found among hospitalizations for primary opioid use disorder (pre-ACA: 16.4%; post-ACA: 17.2%). Despite the increase in the Medicaid coverage after ACA enactment, there was no significant change in the proportion of DAMA before and after ACA periods across various demographic groups and clinical conditions. Time series analyses also indicated no significant trend effect on the proportion of DAMA during the pre- and post-ACA months. As many as 1 in 10 SUD-involved hospitalizations were considered as DAMA. Concerted efforts are needed to enhance insurance benefits for SUDs and patients' knowledge of SUD treatment benefits in order to increase SUD treatment engagement and completion and to reduce DAMA, especially for substance-using patients with Medicaid or opioid use disorder.",Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Demography;Diagnosis;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Inpatients;Insurance Benefits;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Knowledge;Male;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Patient Discharge;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;Patients;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Withholding Treatment;Young Adult,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30829142,2019,Counselor turnover in substance use disorder treatment research: Observations from one multisite trial.,"Background: Counselor workforce turnover is a critical area of concern for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers and researchers. To facilitate the adoption and implementation of innovative treatments, attention must be paid to how SUD treatment workforce issues affect the implementation of clinical effectiveness research. Multiple variables have been shown to relate to turnover, yet reasons that are specific to conducting research have not been systematically assessed. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial testing a sexual risk reduction counselor training intervention, 69 counselors at 4 outpatient SUD treatment sites (2 opioid treatment programs [OTPs], 2 psychosocial) were enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 training conditions (Standard vs. Enhanced). Study counselor and agency turnover rates were calculated. Agency context and policies that impacted research participation were examined. Results: Study turnover rates for enrolled counselors were substantial, ranging from 33% to 74% over approximately a 2-year active study period. Study counselor turnover was significantly greater at outpatient psychosocial programs versus OTPs. Counselor turnover did not differ due to demographic or training condition assignment. Leaving agency employment was the most typical reason for study counselor turnover. Conclusions: This secondary analysis used data from a multisite study with frontline counselors to provide a qualitative description of challenges faced when conducting effectiveness research in SUD treatment settings. That counselors may be both subjects and deliverers of the interventions studied in clinical trials, with implications for differential impact on study implementation, is highlighted. We offer suggestions for researchers seeking to implement effectiveness research in SUD clinical service settings.",Adoption;Adult;Affect;Aged;Attention;Clinical Effectiveness;Clinical Trial;Counselors;Demography;Employment;Female;Humans;Implementation Science;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Multicenter Studies as Topic;Observation;Opioids;Outpatients;Personnel Turnover;Policy;Program;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Reduction;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Suggestion;Therapeutics;Workforce;Young Adult,Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
30849925,2019,Social functioning outcomes among individuals with substance use disorders receiving internet-delivered community reinforcement approach.,"The community reinforcement approach (CRA) is an evidence-based practice for the treatment of substance use disorders and achieving and maintaining abstinence, but few studies have systematically explored the effect of CRA on secondary, yet also important outcomes, such as social functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine whether an internet-based version of the CRA plus contingency management is associated with improved social functioning of individuals seeking substance use disorder treatment in a multi-site clinical effectiveness trial. Social functioning was measured using the 54-item Social Adjustment Scale assessing role performance in six domains (work, social and leisure activities, extended family relationships, marital relationship, parenting, and immediate family). Generalized linear mixed models tested the effects of treatment, time, sex, baseline abstinence, baseline social functioning and baseline psychological distress on overall social functioning and across social functioning subscales at the end of the 12-week treatment phase and 3 and 6 months post treatment. Results showed no significant association between treatment and total social functioning score or any subscale scores. Being male was significantly associated with better social functioning overall at the end of treatment (p = .024). Higher levels of psychological distress at baseline predicted significantly worse social functioning at the end of treatment overall (p = .037). The addition of an internet-based version of the CRA was not associated with greater improvements in social functioning compared to standard outpatient care after 12 weeks of treatment. Implications for internet-delivered CRA are discussed.","Adolescent;Adult;Ambulatory Care;Association;Behavior Therapy;Clinical Effectiveness;Community;Evidence-Based Practice;Extended Family;Family;Female;Humans;Internet;Leisure Activities;Male;Marital Relationship;Overall;Parenting;Psychological Distress;Reinforcement, Psychology;Role;Scales;Sex;Social Adjustment;Social Functioning;Social Work;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Technology;Therapeutics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Time;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Subst Use Misuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

For individuals with HIV and substance use co-morbidities, mistrust may influence engagement with health care, and affect overall health and transmission risk. Medical mistrust can be measured by an individual's mistrust of his/her physician, or mistrust of the medical system. This study examined both types of mistrust among 801 substance-using individuals with uncontrolled HIV infection. The aims were to determine how physician mistrust, medical system mistrust, and discrimination experiences were associated with engagement in HIV primary care. Findings indicated higher levels of physician mistrust, but not medical system mistrust, were associated with a longer time since the last visit to an HIV provider.

30920187,2019,Correlates of Opioid Abstinence in a 42-Month Posttreatment Naturalistic Follow-Up Study of Prescription Opioid Dependence.,"The natural course of prescription opioid use disorder has not been examined in longitudinal studies. The current study examined correlates of opioid abstinence over time after completion of a treatment trial for prescription opioid dependence. The multisite Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study examined different durations of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment and different intensities of counseling to treat prescription opioid dependence, as assessed by DSM-IV; following the clinical trial, a longitudinal study was conducted from March 2009-January 2013. At 18, 30, and 42 months after treatment entry, telephone interviews were conducted (N = 375). In this exploratory, naturalistic study, logistic regression analyses examined the association between treatment modality (including formal treatment and mutual help) and opioid abstinence rates at the follow-up assessments. At the 3 follow-up assessments, approximately half of the participants reported engaging in current substance use disorder treatment (47%-50%). The most common treatments were buprenorphine maintenance (27%-35%) and mutual-help group attendance (27%-30%), followed by outpatient counseling (18%-23%) and methadone maintenance (4%). In adjusted analyses, current opioid agonist treatment showed the strongest association with current opioid abstinence (odds ratios [ORs] = 5.4, 4.6, and 2.8 at the 3 assessments), followed by current mutual-help attendance (ORs = 2.2, 2.7, and 1.9); current outpatient counseling was not significantly associated with abstinence in the adjusted models. While opioid agonist treatment was most strongly associated with opioid abstinence among patients with prescription opioid dependence over time, mutual-help group attendance was independently associated with opioid abstinence. Clinicians should consider recommending both of these interventions to patients with opioid use disorder.

31021654,2019,Associations between pain catastrophizing and clinical characteristics in adults with substance use disorders and co-occurring chronic pain.,"Background: Pain catastrophizing refers to the tendency to interpret pain as harmful, intolerable, or uncontrollable. Greater pain catastrophizing is associated with more pain-related negative phenomena, such as pain reactivity, pain disability, and emotional distress related to pain. Several studies of patients seeking chronic pain treatment have identified an association between pain catastrophizing and misuse of opioids and alcohol; however, it is unknown whether this association would be similarly present in patients with chronic pain seeking substance use disorder treatment. Objectives: The current study examined whether pain catastrophizing is associated with worse pain-related outcomes and psychological functioning in individuals receiving inpatient substance use disorder treatment who endorsed current chronic pain. Methods: In a series of regression models, we tested the associations between pain catastrophizing and functioning, specifically pain interference, craving, anxiety, and days of mood difficulties in a cross-sectional sample of patients seeking substance use disorder treatment with co-occurring chronic pain (N = 244, 67.6% female). Results: Greater pain catastrophizing was associated with more pain interference, higher levels of craving, more anxiety symptoms and more days of mood difficulties, adjusted for demographic characteristics and pain severity.

31064390,2019,Implementation facilitation to promote emergency department-initiated buprenorphine for opioid use disorder: protocol for a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation study (Project ED HEALTH).,"Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently present to the emergency department (ED) after overdose, or seeking treatment for general medical conditions, their addiction, withdrawal symptoms, or complications of injection drug use, such as soft tissue infections. ED-initiated buprenorphine has been shown to be effective in increasing patient engagement in treatment compared with brief intervention with a facilitated referral or referral alone. However, adoption into practice has lagged behind need. To address this implementation challenge, we are evaluating the impact of implementation facilitation (IF) on the adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine for OUD into practice. This protocol describes a study that is being conducted through the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Center for the Clinical Trials Network. A hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation study design is used to evaluate the effectiveness of a standard educational dissemination strategy versus IF on implementation (primary) and effectiveness (secondary) outcomes in four urban, academic EDs. Sites start with a standard 60-min ""Grand Rounds"" educational intervention describing the prevalence of ED patients with OUD, the evidence for opioid agonist treatment and for innovative interventions with ED-initiated buprenorphine; followed by a 1-year baseline evaluation period. Using a modified stepped wedge design, sites are randomly assigned to the IF intervention which is guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework to assess evidence, context, and facilitation-related factors impacting the adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine. During the 6 months of IF through the 1-year IF evaluation period, external facilitators work with local stakeholders to tailor and refine a bundle of activities to meet the site's needs. The primary analyses compare the baseline evaluation period to the IF evaluation period (n = 120 patients with untreated OUD enrolled during each period) on (1) rates of provision of ED-initiated buprenorphine by ED providers with referral for ongoing medication (implementation outcome) and (2) rates of patient engagement in addiction treatment on the 30th day after the ED visit (effectiveness outcome). Finally, we will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to determine if the effectiveness benefits are worth the additional costs. Results will generate novel information regarding the impact of IF as a strategy to promote ED-initiated buprenorphine.

31068400,2019,The Impact of Increased Hydrocodone Regulation on Opioid Prescribing in an Urban Safety-Net Health Care System.,"Hydrocodone-combination analgesics were changed from Schedule III to Schedule II to discourage the prescribing of these analgesics. Our primary aim was to explore the effect of hydrocodone rescheduling on opioid prescribing within an urban safety-net health care system. Data were extracted from electronic records of ambulatory patients (N = 82,432 patients) prescribed hydrocodone-combination, codeine-combination, or tramadol opioid analgesics (N = 200,675 prescriptions) between October 6, 2013 and October 6, 2015. Data analyses modeled predicted probabilities of hydrocodone-combination prescriptions (HCPs). Chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic pain (ie, ≥3 opioid prescriptions/12 months) and morphine milligram equivalency (MME) levels were also examined. The probability of providers writing HCPs decreased significantly from pre- to postrescheduling (0.525 vs 0.158, respectively, P &lt; .0001). However, this coincided with large probability increases in codeine-combination (0.064 vs 0.269) and tramadol prescriptions (0.412 vs 0.573). The probability of HCPs varied across physician specialty (P &lt; .0001), patient diagnoses (P &lt; .0001), COT versus non-COT patients (P &lt; .0001), and patient characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, and age; P &lt; .05). COT patients received significantly more opioid prescriptions in the postrescheduling period (M = 4.81 vs M = 4.27; P &lt; .0001). Patients on &lt;20 MME/day increased slightly from pre- to postrescheduling (P &lt; .0001). Significant declines in HCPs occurred after rescheduling; however, one third of patients prescribed opioids remained on doses ≥20 MME/day. Codeine- and tramadol-prescription probabilities increased significantly and providers may have an increased perception of safety about these medications. Physicians and health care systems must reduce their overreliance on opioids in treating pain, especially chronic pain, as all opioids incur some level of risk.","Adult;Aged;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Codeine;Controlled Substances;Data Analysis;Diagnosis;Drug Prescriptions;Drug Utilization;Drug and Narcotic Control;Electronics;Ethnic Groups;Female;Health Care Systems;Humans;Hydrocodone;Male;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Perception;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Probability;Racial Stocks;Records;Regulation;Risk;Safety;Safety-net Providers;Schedules;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics;Tramadol;Urban Health Services;Writing",Chronic Pain;Pain,J Am Board Fam Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31212213,2019,"Integration of screening, assessment, and treatment for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: An evaluation in three pilot sites.","This pilot study evaluated whether use of evidence-based implementation strategies to integrate care for cannabis and other drug use into primary care (PC) as part of Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) increased diagnosis and treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). Patients who visited the three pilot PC sites were eligible. Implementation strategies included practice coaching, electronic health record decision support, and performance feedback (3/2015-4/2016). BHI introduced annual screening for past-year cannabis and other drug use, a Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 SUDs, and shared decision-making about treatment options. Main analyses tested whether the proportions of PC patients diagnosed with, and treated for, new cannabis or other drug use disorders (CUDs and DUDs, respectively), differed significantly pre- and post-implementation. Of 39,599 eligible patients, 57% and 59% were screened for cannabis and other drug use, respectively. Among PC patients reporting daily cannabis use (2%) or any drug use (1%), 51% and 37%, respectively, completed an SUD Symptom Checklist. The proportion of PC patients with newly diagnosed CUD increased significantly post-implementation (5 v 17 per 10,000 patients, p &lt; 0.0001), but not other DUDs (10 vs 13 per 10,000, p = 0.24). The proportion treated for newly diagnosed CUDs did not increase post-implementation (1 vs 1 per 10,000, p = 0.80), but did for those treated for newly diagnosed other DUDs (1 vs 3 per 10,000, p = 0.038). A pilot implementation of BHI to increase routine screening and assessment for SUDs was associated with increased new CUD diagnoses and a small increase in treatment of new other DUDs.","Adult;Aged;Cannabis;Checklist;Clinical Decision-Making;Coaching;Decision Making, Shared;Diagnosis;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Drug Use Disorders;Electronic Health Records;Evidence-Based Medicine;Feedback;Female;Health;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Male;Marijuana Abuse;Marijuana Smoking;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;News;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Primary Health Care;Quality Improvement;Screening;Street Drugs;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics",Drug Use Disorders;Marijuana Abuse;Mental Disorders;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31280002,2019,Syringe disposal among people who inject drugs before and after the implementation of a syringe services program.,"Due to the increase in people who use opioids in the US, there has been a steady increase in injection drug use. Without access to safe syringe disposal locations, people who inject drugs (PWID) have few options other than improper disposal, including in public places. In 2016, Florida's first legal Syringe Services Program (SSP) was established in Miami. This study aims to compare syringe disposal practices among PWID before and after the implementation of an SSP. Visual inspection walkthroughs of randomly selected census blocks in the neighborhoods in the top quartile of narcotics-related arrests were conducted to assess improperly discarded syringes. Syringe location was geocoded in ArcGIS. Adult PWID pre-SSP (n = 448) and post-SSP (n = 482) implementation were recruited for a survey using respondent-driven sampling in Miami. A Poisson regression model was used to determine the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of improper syringe disposal pre- and post-SSP. A total of 191 syringes/1000 blocks were found post-implementation versus 371/1000 blocks pre-implementation, representing a 49% decrease after SSP implementation. In the surveys, 70% reported any improper syringe disposal post-SSP implementation versus 97% pre-SSP implementation. PWID in the post-implementation survey had 39% lower adjusted relative risk (aRR = 0.613; 95% CI = 0.546, 0.689) of improper syringe disposal as compared to pre-implementation. There was a significant decrease in the number of improperly discarded syringes in public in Miami after the implementation of an SSP. Providing PWID with proper disposal venues such as an SSP could decrease public disposal in other communities.","AIDS-Related Complex;Adult;Censuses;Community;Drug Users;Female;Florida;HIV;Health Plan Implementation;Humans;Injections;Male;Narcotics;Needle-Exchange Programs;Neighborhood;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poisson Distribution;Program;Program Evaluation;Regression Analysis;Relative Risk;Residence Characteristics;Respondents;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Syringes","AIDS-Related Complex;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31418645,2019,Pharmacists' attitudes toward dispensing naloxone and medications for opioid use disorder: A scoping review of the literature.,"Background: Pharmacists are on the frontline caring for patients at risk of an opioid overdose and for patients with an opioid use disorder (OUD). Dispensing naloxone and medications for OUD and counseling patients about these medications are ways pharmacists can provide care. Key to pharmacists' involvement is their willingness to take on these practice responsibilities. Methods: The purpose of this scoping review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize published literature describing pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone and medications for OUD, i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. All searches were performed on December 7, 2018, in 5 databases: Embase.com, PubMed.gov, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Wiley, and Clarivate Web of Science. Articles included original research conducted in the United States, described attitude-related language toward naloxone and medications for OUD, and pharmacists. Results: A total of 1323 articles were retrieved, 7 were included. Five studies reported on pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone dispensing, 1 study reported on attitudes toward naloxone, buprenorphine, and buprenorphine/naloxone, and 1 reported on attitudes toward buprenorphine/naloxone. Respondents were diverse, including pharmacists from different practice specialties. Studies found that pharmacists agreed with a naloxone standing order, believed that naloxone should be dispensed to individuals at risk of an opioid overdose, and were supportive of dispensing buprenorphine. A minority of pharmacists expressed negative attitudes. Barriers cited to implementation included education and training, workflow, and management support. Conclusions: Pharmacists were positive in their attitudes toward increased practice responsibilities for patients at risk of an opioid overdose or with an OUD. Pharmacists must receive education and training to be current in their understanding of OUD medications, and they must be supported in order to provide effective care to this patient population.","Attitude;Attitude of Health Personnel;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Caring;Comprehension;Counseling;Database;Drug Overdose;Education;Health;Humans;Index;Language;Literature;Methadone;Methods;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Nursing;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmacists;Population;Registers;Research;Respondents;Review;Risk;Science;Standing Orders;Substance Use;United States;Workflow",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31436447,2020,Enhancing patient navigation with contingent financial incentives for substance use abatement in persons with HIV and substance use.,"Substance use can interfere with HIV treatment. A previous multisite clinical trial (Metsch et al., 2016) tested 2 behavioral interventions designed to improve treatment engagement in people with comorbid HIV and drug or heavy alcohol use. Clinical trial participants were randomized to treatment as usual (N = 264), patient navigation (PN; N = 266), or PN with contingency management (PN + CM; N = 271) for 6 months. PN + CM patients could earn financial incentives both for entering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and for submitting urine and breath samples negative for opioids, stimulants, and alcohol. This secondary analysis compared frequencies of treatment entry and sample submission in the PN versus PN + CM groups and examined associations with viral suppression (defined as ≤200 copies/mL). Incentives were associated with a higher percentage of patients entering SUD treatment (PN = 25.5%; PN + CM = 47.6%; p &lt; .001), a higher percentage submitting samples for drug testing (PN median = 2, interquartile range [IQR] = 0.5; PN + CM median = 8, IQR = 5.1; p &lt; .0001) and a higher percentage submitting samples negative for targeted drugs and alcohol (PN median = 1, IQR = 0.3; PN + CM median = 6, IQR = 2.9; p &lt; .0001). Within the PN + CM group, up to 58% of those with high rates of engagement in activities were virally suppressed at 6 months versus 24-29% in subgroups with lowest engagement. In conclusion, CM was feasibly incorporated into PN for persons with HIV and SUD and was associated with higher rates of engagement in targeted substance use abatement activities. CM has the potential to improve health outcomes in this population.

31443894,2019,Understanding site variability in a multisite clinical trial of a technology-delivered psychosocial intervention for substance use disorders.,"Significant fixed effects of site (main effects of site and/or site by treatment interactions) on primary outcome have been identified in the majority of studies performed by NIDA's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. While rarely explored, identifying patient- and site-level variables that are associated with site effects can provide information about the context in which outcome is optimized. In a 10-site clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial intervention compared to usual treatment of patients (N = 507) with substance use disorders, the primary outcome analysis revealed significant main effect of site, modeled as a fixed effect, on the outcome of abstinence (Campbell et al., 2014). In the current analysis, we use a two-level, hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) to identify patient- and site-level variables associated with abstinence outcome, while modeling site as a random factor. The site-specific percentage of patients abstinent in the last 4 weeks of the study varied from 6.1% to 40%. However, only 6.7% (p = 0.08) of variability in end-of-study abstinence was accounted for by site, indicating a small-moderate effect. Among patient-level predictors, older age (OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.71; p = 0.0009), abstinence at baseline (OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.73, 4.45; p &lt; 0.0001), and among site-level predictors, higher annual clinic admissions (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.59; p = 0.0251) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of abstinence. When controlling for these three variables in a HGLM, only patient age and abstinence at baseline remained significant, and random factor site explained only 1.4% of variability in end-of-study abstinence, a 79% reduction in magnitude. The findings suggest that only some amount of variability in abstinence outcomes among sites can be explained by a combination of patient- and site-level variables. Our findings support the case that variability between sites is a natural phenomenon, and our methodological recommendation is that site be modeled as a random factor when analyzing multi-site clinical trials.",Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Clinical Trial;Community Mental Health Services;Comprehension;Drug Abuse;Female;Humans;Internet;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Multicenter Study;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Patients;Psychosocial Intervention;Research Design;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Technology;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States,Drug Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31506368,2019,Predictors of Medication-Assisted Treatment Initiation for Opioid Use Disorder in an Interdisciplinary Primary Care Model.,"Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is underused in primary care. Little is known about patient demographics associated with MAT initiation, particularly among models with an interdisciplinary approach, including behavioral health integration. We hypothesize few disparities in MAT initiation by patient characteristics after implementing this model for OUD. Electronic health record data were used to identify adults with ≥1 primary care visit in 1 of 2 study clinics in a Pacific Northwest academic health system between September 1, 2015 and August 31, 2017 (n = 23,372). Rates of documented OUD diagnosis were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression estimated odds ratios of MAT initiation, defined as ≥1 electronic health record order for buprenorphine or naltrexone, by patient covariates. Seven percent of the study sample had an OUD diagnosis. Of those patients, 32% had ≥1 MAT order. Patients with documented psychiatric diagnoses or tobacco use had higher odds of initiating MAT (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62, P = .0003; OR = 2.46, P &lt; .0001, respectively). Uninsured, Medicaid, and Medicare patients had lower odds than those commercially insured (OR = 0.53, 0.38, and 0.31, respectively; P &lt; .0001). Patients who were older, of a race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, had documented diabetes, and had documented asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed lower odds of initiation. MAT initiation varied by patient characteristics, including disparities by insurance coverage and race/ethnicity. The addition of behavioral health did not eliminate disparities in care, but higher odds of initiation among those with a documented psychiatric diagnosis may suggest this model reaches some vulnerable populations. Additional research is needed to further examine these findings.","Addiction Medicine;Adult;Asthma;Behavioral Medicine;Buprenorphine;Demography;Diagnosis;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Electronic Health Records;Ethnic Groups;Female;Health;Healthcare Disparities;Hispanics;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Logistic Regression;Male;Medicaid;Medicare;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Northwestern United States;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pacific Northwest;Patients;Primary Health Care;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive;Racial Stocks;Research;Retrospective Studies;Therapeutics;Tobacco Use;Uninsured;Vulnerable Populations;Whites","Asthma;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",J Am Board Fam Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31540607,2019,Effects of access barriers and medication acceptability on buprenorphine-naloxone treatment utilization over 2 years: Results from a multisite randomized trial of adults with opioid use disorder.,"Nationwide efforts seek to address the opioid epidemic by increasing access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), particularly with buprenorphine. A poorly understood challenge is that among individuals with OUD who do receive buprenorphine, many do not adhere to the pharmacotherapy long enough to achieve sustained benefits. We aimed to identify factors associated with buprenorphine treatment utilization over time. We used random-intercept modeling to identify factors associated with buprenorphine treatment utilization over 2 years after first follow-up by 789 individuals with OUD who had participated in a multi-site randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine compared to methadone. Key predictors were participants' reports of buprenorphine treatment accessibility and acceptability (assessed at first follow-up) and their interaction effects, controlling for baseline randomization status, sociodemographics, and other covariates. Approximately 9.3-11.2% of participants utilized buprenorphine treatment over the 2 years of follow-up. Interaction effects indicated that individuals who perceived buprenorphine to be both accessible and acceptable were most likely to use buprenorphine during follow-up, controlling for other factors. In contrast, individuals who perceived buprenorphine to be unacceptable were least likely to use buprenorphine, regardless the level of perceived access to the medication. Buprenorphine treatment utilization was also negatively associated with Hispanic ethnicity, West coast context, and cumulative months receiving methadone treatment and incarceration during follow-up. To engage more individuals with OUD in long-term treatment with buprenorphine, interventions should target buprenorphine treatment acceptability, in addition to increasing buprenorphine access, and tailor efforts to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.

31542630,2019,"""You can see those concentric rings going out"": Emergency personnel's experiences treating overdose and perspectives on policy-level responses to the opioid crisis in New Hampshire.","In parallel to a substantial increase in opioid overdose deaths in New Hampshire (NH), emergency personnel experienced an increase in opioid-related encounters. To inform public health responses to this crisis, insights into the experiences and perspectives of those emergency personnel who treat opioid-related overdoses are warranted. Systematically examine emergency personnel's experiences treating opioid overdoses and obtain their perspectives on policy-level responses to the opioid crisis in NH. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 18 first responders [firefighters (n = 6), police officers (n = 6), emergency medical service providers (n = 6)] and 18 emergency department personnel employed in six NH counties. Interviews focused on emergency personnel's perspectives on fentanyl/heroin formulations, experiences treating overdoses, harm reduction strategies, and experiences with treatment referral. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis. Emergency personnel cited the potency and inconsistency of fentanyl-laced heroin as primary drivers of opioid overdose. Increases in overdose-related encounters took a substantial emotional toll on emergency personnel, who described a range of responses including feelings of burnout, exhaustion, and helplessness. While some emergency personnel felt conflicted about the implementation of harm reduction strategies like syringe services programs, others emphasized the necessity of these services. Emergency personnel expressed frustration with barriers to treatment referral in the state and recommended immediate treatment access after overdose events. Findings suggest that interventions addressing trauma and burnout are necessary to support emergency personnel, while expanded harm reduction and treatment access are critical to support those who experience opioid overdose in NH.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Burnout, Psychological;Death;Drug Overdose;Emergencies;Emergency Medical Services;Emergency Responders;Emergency Service, Hospital;Feelings;Female;Fentanyl;Firefighters;Frustration;Harm Reduction;Heroin;Humans;Interview;Male;Middle Aged;New Hampshire;Occupational Groups;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Police Officers;Policy;Program;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Syringes;Therapeutics;West Virginia;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Wounds and Injuries,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Naloxone is an opioid overdose reversal medication that is critical for saving lives. This study was conducted to understand emergency responders' and opioid users' experiences with, and opinions about, naloxone use and distribution in NH. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 76 opioid users and 36 emergency responders in six NH counties in 2016-2017. Interviews focused on respondents' experiences with opioid use and overdose. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and reviewed for consensus among coders. Directed content analysis was used to review high-level domains and identify subthemes. Users and responders largely agreed that naloxone had become increasingly available in NH at the time of the study. Reported responder barriers to naloxone acceptance included perceptions that increased naloxone availability may enable riskier opioid use and fails to address the underlying causes of addiction. Reported opioid-user barriers included cost, legality, and lack of knowledge regarding distribution locations and indications for use. Opioid users' and emergency responders' perceptions about naloxone may limit the optimal use of naloxone within the community. This study identifies opportunities to address misconceptions about naloxone and challenges in accessing naloxone, which may improve opioid overdose prevention strategies.","Address;Adult;Community;Consensus;Cost;Drug Overdose;Emergency Responders;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Harm Reduction;Humans;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Knowledge;Male;Middle Aged;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;New Hampshire;Opiate Overdose;Opinions;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Perception;Respondents;Review;Savings;Time;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31615549,2019,"Electronic self-administered screening for substance use in adult primary care patients: feasibility and acceptability of the tobacco, alcohol, prescription medication, and other substance use (myTAPS) screening tool.","The TAPS Tool is a substance use screening and brief assessment instrument that was developed for use in primary care medical settings. It is one of the first screening instruments to provide rapid assessment of all commonly used substance classes, including illicit and prescription opioids, and is one of the only available screeners designed and validated in an electronic self-administered format (myTAPS). This secondary analysis of data from the TAPS Tool validation study describes the feasibility and acceptability of the myTAPS among primary care patients. Adult patients (N = 2000) from five primary care clinics completed the TAPS Tool on a tablet computer (myTAPS), and in an interviewer-administered format. Requests for assistance and time required were tracked, and participants completed a survey on ease of use, utilization of audio guidance, and format preference. Logistic regression was used to examine outcomes in defined subpopulations, including groups that may have greater difficulty completing an electronic screener, and those that may prefer an electronic self-administered approach. Almost all participants (98.3%) reported that the myTAPS was easy to use. The median time to complete myTAPS screening was 4.0 min (mean 4.48, standard deviation 2.57). More time was required by participants who were older, Hispanic, Black, or reported non-medical prescription drug use, while less time was required by women. Assistance was requested by 25% of participants, and was more frequently requested by those who with lower education (OR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.62-2.67) or age &gt; 65 years (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.98-3.93). Audio guidance was utilized by 18.3%, and was more frequently utilized by participants with lower education (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.54-2.63), age &gt; 65 years (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.22-2.61), or Black race (OR = 1.30, 95% 1.01-1.68). The myTAPS format was preferred by women (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.00-1.66) and individuals with drug use (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.88), while participants with lower education preferred the interviewer-administered format (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 2.00-3.78). Overall, myTAPS screening was feasible and well accepted by adult primary care patients. Clinics adopting electronic screening should be prepared to offer assistance to some patients, particularly those who are older or less educated, and should have the capacity to use an interviewer-administered approach when required.","Acceptability of Health Care;Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Alcohol Abuse;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Computers, Handheld;Education;Electronics;Feasibility Studies;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Interviewers;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Reproducibility of Results;Screening;Self;Sex Factors;Socioeconomic Factors;Standards;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Tablet Computers;Time;Time Factors;Tobacco;Tobacco Use Disorder;Validation Study;Women;Young Adult",Alcohol Abuse;Alcoholism;Drug Abuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Tobacco Use Disorder,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study aims to quantify the frequency and intensity of ratings of desire to die and perceived overdose risk proximal to the most recent opioid overdose event among individuals admitted for opioid use disorder detoxification/stabilization. Cross-sectional study (June 2017-July 2018) assessing patterns of opioid use and variables related to overdose history was conducted in a not-for-profit psychiatric hospital. Adults (&gt;18 years) with opioid use disorder were eligible and 120 of 122 participants completed all measures. Forty-one percent were women and 85% self-identified as white. Participants' perceptions of the likelihood of overdose and their suicidal motivations (defined as desire to die) prior to most recent opioid overdose was self-rated on a scale of 0 (no desire to die/no risk of death) to 10 (I definitely wanted to die/I definitely thought I would die). Most (92%) surviving opioid overdose used heroin/fentanyl; over half reported some desire to die prior to their most recent overdose, with 36% reporting strong (&gt;7/10) desire to die and 21% reporting 10/10 ""I definitely wanted to die."" Perceptions of overdose risk were also variable, with 30% reporting no (0/10) likelihood of overdose and 13% reporting a high (10/10) likelihood.

31704382,2019,Trajectory classes of opioid use among individuals in a randomized controlled trial comparing extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine-naloxone.,"To advance our understanding of medication treatments for opioid use disorders (OUDs), identification of distinct subgroups and factors associated with differential treatment response is critical. We examined trajectories of opioid use for patients with OUD who were randomized to (but not in all cases inducted onto) buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), and identified characteristics associated with each trajectory. Growth mixture models (GMMs) were run to identify distinct trajectories of days of opioid use among a subsample of 535 individuals with OUD who participated in a 24-week randomized controlled trial (RCT; 2014-2016) of BUP-NX (n = 281) or XR-NTX (n = 254). Four distinct opioid use trajectory classes were identified for BUP-NX (near abstinent/no use (59%); low use (13.2%); low use, increasing over time (15%); and moderate use, increasing over time (12.8%)). Three distinct opioid use trajectory classes were found for XR-NTX (near abstinent/no use (59.1%); low use (14.6%); and moderate use, increasing over time (26.4%)). Across both BUP-NX and XR-NTX, the near abstinent/no use class had the highest number of medical management visits. Within BUP-NX, the low use class had a greater proportion of individuals with a previous successful treatment history compared with other classes. Within XR-NTX, the moderate use, increasing over time class had the highest proportion of Hispanic participants compared with other classes. Findings highlight the significant heterogeneity of opioid use during a RCT of BUP-NX and XR-NTX and factors associated with opioid use patterns including medical management visits and history of treatment success.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Comprehension;Delayed-Action Preparations;Female;Growth;Hispanics;History;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Randomized Controlled Trial;Therapeutics;Time;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31835068,2020,Prevalence and treatment of opioid use disorders among primary care patients in six health systems.,"The U.S. experienced nearly 48,000 opioid overdose deaths in 2017. Treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine is a recommended part of primary care, yet little is known about current U.S. practices in this setting. This observational study reports the prevalence of documented OUD and OUD treatment with buprenorphine among primary care patients in six large health systems. Adults with ≥2 primary care visits during a three-year period (10/1/2013-9/30/2016) in six health systems were included. Data were obtained from electronic health record and claims data, with measures, assessed over the three-year period, including indicators for documented OUD from ICD 9 and 10 codes and OUD treatment with buprenorphine. The prevalence of OUD treatment was adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and health system. Among 1,368,604 primary care patients, 13,942 (1.0 %) had documented OUD, and among these, 21.0 % had OUD treatment with buprenorphine. For those with documented OUD, the adjusted prevalence of OUD treatment with buprenorphine varied across demographic and clinical subgroups. OUD treatment was lower among patients who were older, women, Black/African American and Hispanic (compared to white), non-commercially insured, and those with non-cancer pain, mental health disorders, greater comorbidity, and more opioid prescriptions, emergency department visits or hospitalizations. Among primary care patients in six health systems, one in five with an OUD were treated with buprenorphine, with disparities across demographic and clinical characteristics. Less buprenorphine treatment among those with greater acute care utilization highlights an opportunity for systems-level changes to increase OUD treatment.","Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Buprenorphine;Cancer Pain;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Cross-Sectional Studies;Death;Delivery of Health Care;Demography;Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Ethnic Groups;Female;Gender;Health;Health Services Research;Hispanics;Hospitalization;Humans;ICD-9;Indicators;Male;Measures;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Observational Study;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pilot Projects;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Report;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States;Whites;Women;Young Adult",Cancer Pain;Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31868830,2020,Predictors of Opioid and Alcohol Pharmacotherapy Initiation at Hospital Discharge Among Patients Seen by an Inpatient Addiction Consult Service.,"Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and alcohol use disorder (MAUD) are effective and under-prescribed. Hospital-based addiction consult services can engage out-of-treatment adults in addictions care. Understanding which patients are most likely to initiate MOUD and MAUD can inform interventions and deepen understanding of hospitals' role in addressing substance use disorders (SUD). Determine patient- and consult-service level characteristics associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation during hospitalization. We analyzed data from a study of the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), an interprofessional hospital-based addiction consult service at an academic medical center. Researchers collected patient surveys and clinical data from September 2015 to May 2018. We used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with medication initiation among participants with OUD, AUD, or both. Candidate variables included patient demographics, social determinants, and treatment-related factors. Three hundred thirty-nine participants had moderate to severe OUD, AUD, or both and were not engaged in MOUD/MAUD care at admission. Past methadone maintenance treatment (aOR 2.07, 95%CI (1.17, 3.66)), homelessness (aOR 2.63, 95%CI (1.52, 4.53)), and partner substance use (aOR 2.05, 95%CI (1.12, 3.76) were associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation. Concurrent methamphetamine use disorder (aOR 0.32, 95%CI (0.18, 0.56)) was negatively associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation. The association of MOUD/MAUD initiation with homelessness and partner substance use suggests that hospitalization may be an opportunity to reach highly-vulnerable people, further underscoring the need to provide hospital-based addictions care as a health-system strategy. Methamphetamine's negative association with MOUD/MAUD warrants further study.","Academic Medical Centers;Adult;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Comprehension;Demography;Drug Therapy;Health;Homelessness;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Inpatients;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Methadone;Methamphetamine;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Discharge;Patients;Persons;Research Personnel;Role;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics",Alcohol Use Disorder;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31914790,2020,Predictors for Poor Linkage to Care Among Hospitalized Persons Living with HIV and Co-Occurring Substance Use Disorder.,"Persons living with HIV (PLWH) with substance use disorders (SUD) remain a population difficult to engage in HIV care. Project HOPE (Hospital Visits as an Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement), a randomized controlled trial testing patient navigation with/without contingency management for PLWH with SUD, aimed to address this disparity. PLWH with SUD who were out of care were recruited from 11 hospitals across the United States from 2012 to 2014. Baseline socioeconomic factors, medical mistrust scores, and perceived discrimination surveys were collected at enrollment and evaluated for effects on linkage to care at the 6-month follow-up assessment. Linkage to care (attending an outpatient visit for HIV care), early linkage to care (attending first visit within 30 days of enrollment), and engagement in care (two HIV visits within the 6-month period) were determined by medical record abstraction, supplemented by self-report. Among 801 participants enrolled in the study (mean age 45 years, 33% women, and 73% African American), those who did not complete high school and with severe food insecurity had lower odds of being linked to care at 6 months. Those with high levels of medical mistrust, recent drug use, and who did not complete high school had lower odds of early linkage to care. Early linkage was associated with higher odds of engagement at 6 months and was mitigated by both patient navigator interventions (all p &lt; .05). Addressing social determinants of health is critical to correct the disparity seen in HIV outcomes among PLWH with SUD.

31948487,2020,Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center for the clinical trials network working group report.,"There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR. Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.","Address;Adult;Advisory Committees;Alcohol Use Disorder;Algorithms;Clinical Decision Support;Clinical Trial;Conferences;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Delivery of Health Care;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Electronics;Epidemics;Face;Fentanyl;Health Services Accessibility;Heroin;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Local Government;Mass Screening;Measures;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outline;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Private Sector;Quality Improvement;Report;Screening;Specialists;Technology;Therapeutics;United States;Work",Alcohol Use Disorder;Drug Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31975639,2020,Sources of Misused Prescription Opioids and Their Association with Prescription Opioid Use Disorder in the United States: Sex and Age Differences.,"Background: Prescription opioid (PO) misuse and prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) are a national crisis in the USA. To inform strategies for reducing the PO epidemic, research is needed on the sources of misused POs and their association with POUD. Methods: Past-year PO misusers aged ≥12 (N = 6033) from the 2015 to 2016 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health were analyzed. The most recent source of misused POs was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between the sources of misused POs and past-year POUD. All analyses were stratified by age groups for each sex. Results: Overall, the most common sources of misused POs were obtaining from friends/relatives for free (40.27%) and physicians (36.59%). Males had a higher prevalence of buying POs from friends/relatives or drug dealers/strangers than females. Significant age differences also emerged. Buying POs from drug dealers/strangers (vs. obtaining POs free from friends/relatives) was strong predictor of past-year POUD in both sexes. In the sex- and age-stratified analyses, significant associations of past-year POUD with (1) buying from drug dealers/strangers emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+; (2) buying from friends/relatives emerged among males aged 12+ and females aged 18-25; (3) obtaining from physicians emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+. Conclusions: Our findings indicate different risk profiles for POUD across sex and age groups with different diversion sources. Prevention and treatment programs for POUD should be tailored to consider sex and developmental age differences in sources of opioids.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Epidemics;Female;Friends;Health;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Methods;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Program;Relatives;Research;Risk;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Subst Use Misuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32039934,2020,Secondary Analysis of Pain Outcomes in a Large Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Buprenorphine/Naloxone Versus Methadone for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with chronic pain. We investigated the association between medication treatments for OUD and pain in a post-hoc secondary analysis of a randomized trial of methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone. 1241 individuals with OUD participated in an open label, pragmatic randomized trial of methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone in nine treatment programs licensed to dispense agonist medication for OUD between 2006 to 2009. In this post-hoc analysis, pain was dichotomized (present or not present) using responses from the Short Form-36. Logistic regression models were fit to test the effect of (1) having baseline pain on week 24 retention, (2) treatment assignment on improvement in pain among those reporting pain at baseline, and (3) pain improvement at week 4 on week 24 retention among those reporting pain at baseline. Almost half (48.2%) of the sample reported pain at baseline. Participants with baseline pain did not significantly differ in week 24 retention compared to those without baseline pain. Among those reporting pain at baseline, there was no significant difference between treatment arms in improvement of pain at week 4, but improvement in pain at week 4 was associated with significantly greater odds of being retained at week 24 (OR [95% CI] = 1.76 [1.10, 2.82], P = 0.020). In this large multisite randomized trial of medication treatments for OUD, nearly half of the participants reported pain at baseline, and improvement in pain early in treatment was associated with increased likelihood of retention in treatment.","Analgesics, Opioid;Arm;Association;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Chronic Pain;Form;Humans;Logistic Regression;Methadone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Program;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32065941,2020,Understanding the increase in opioid overdoses in New Hampshire: A rapid epidemiologic assessment.,"New Hampshire (NH) has had among the highest rates of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the United States for several years in a row-more than three times the national average in 2016. This mixed-methods study investigated drug-using practices and perspectives of NH residents who use opioids to inform policy in tackling the overdose crisis. Seventy-six participants from six NH counties completed demographic surveys and semi-structured interviews focused on drug-using practices and perspectives, including use precursors, fentanyl-seeking behaviors, and experiences with overdose. Rigorous qualitative methods were used to analyze interview data including transcription, coding and content analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated on quantitative survey data. Eighty-four percent of interviewees had knowingly used fentanyl in their lifetime, 70 % reported overdosing at least once, and 42 % had sought a batch of drugs known to have caused an overdose. The majority stated most heroin available in NH was laced with fentanyl and acknowledged that variability across batches increased overdose risk. Participants reported high availability of fentanyl and limited access to prevention, treatment, and harm reduction programs. There was widespread support for expanding education campaigns for youth, increasing treatment availability, and implementing needle exchange programs. A confluence of factors contribute to the NH opioid overdose crisis. Despite consensus that fentanyl is the primary cause of overdoses, individuals continue to use it and affirm limited availability of resources to address the problem. Policies targeting innovative prevention, harm reduction, and treatment efforts are needed to more effectively address the crisis.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Coding;Comprehension;Consensus;Death;Education;Female;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Heroin;Humans;Interview;Male;Methods;Needle-Exchange Programs;New Hampshire;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Program;Resources;Risk;Rural Population;Self Report;Statistics;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Surveys, Demographic;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Young Adult;Youth",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Understanding the association of CNCP with SUD is important for informing the need and potential benefits of pain assessment/management among those with SUDs. We analyzed electronic health record data from 2013 to 2018 among adults aged ≥18 years (N = 951,533; mean age: 48.4 years; 57.4 % female) in a large academic healthcare system. Adjusted logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the association of CNCP conditions with opioid overdose, emergency department utilization, and inpatient hospitalization stratified by different SUD diagnoses and by gender. Among the total sample, the prevalence of CNCP was 46.6 % and any SUD was 11.2 %. The majority of patients with a SUD had CNCP (opioid: 74.7 %; sedative: 72.3 %; cannabis: 64.3 %; alcohol: 58.7 %; tobacco: 59.5 %). The prevalence of CNCP was greater in females vs. males for most SUD diagnoses. The presence of CNCP was associated with more mental health disorders and chronic medical conditions among each SUD group. CNCP was associated with significantly decreased odds of overdose among those with opioid use disorder but increased odds of overdose and healthcare utilization among other SUDs. CNCP was positively associated with overdose in females, but not males, with alcohol or non-opioid drug use disorders. The direction and magnitude of the association between CNCP and negative health indicators differed as a function of SUD type and gender, respectively. Greater awareness of potential unmet pain treatment need may have implications for improving SUD outcomes.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Awareness;Cancer Pain;Cannabis;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Drug Use Disorders;Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Gender;Health;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Hospitalization;Humans;Indicators;Inpatients;Logistic Regression;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Prevalence;Risk;Sedatives;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Drug Overdose;Drug Use Disorders;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32114329,2020,Comparison of timeline follow-back self-report and oral fluid testing to detect substance use in adult primary care patients.,"Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) interviews using self-report are often used to assess substance use. Oral fluid testing (OFT) offers an objective measure of substance use. There are limited data on the agreement between TLFB and OFT. In this secondary analysis from a multisite study in five primary care sites, self-reported TLFB and OFT data collected under confidential conditions were compared to assess concordance (N=1799). OFT samples were analyzed for marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and non-medical use of prescription opioids. Demographic differences in discordance relative to TLFB and OFT concordant results for marijuana, the only substance with an adequate sample size in this analysis, were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Overall concordance rates between TLFB and OFT were 94.9 % or higher for each substance, driven by large subgroups with no use. Among participants with discordant use, marijuana was the only substance with lower detection on OFT than self-report (27.6 % OFT-positive only vs 32.2 % TLFB-positive only), whereas cocaine (65.6 % vs 8.6 %), prescription opioids (90.4 % vs 6.0 %), and heroin (40.7 % vs 26.0 %) all had higher detection via OFT than TLFB. Participants who reported marijuana use but had a negative OFT were more likely to be younger, Hispanic, and White compared to those with TLFB and OFT concordant positive results. TLFB and OFT show disparate detection of different substances.

32146348,2020,Examining risk behavior and syringe coverage among people who inject drugs accessing a syringe services program: A latent class analysis.,"Injection drug use (IDU) remains a significant public health problem. IDU has been associated closely with the opioid crisis; driving overdose, HIV, and Hepatitis C (HCV) infection nationwide. Syringe services programs (SSPs) remain pivotal evidence-based interventions to reduce harm and engage subgroups of people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aims to provide policy considerations from the IDEA SSP, the first legal SSP in the state of Florida. We performed a latent class analysis on patterns of substance use among participants (N = 982) newly enrolled in a syringe services program (SSP). Associations between classes of substance use and sociodemographic variables, risky injection and sex behaviors, HIV/HCV status and syringe coverage were analyzed using the R3STEP and BCH 3-step procedures in latent class regression. We found a three-class solution: Heroin-Dominant class (73.9%), Methamphetamine-Dominant class (9.5%) and Heroin/Cocaine class (16.6%). Compared to Heroin-Dominant class, the Heroin/Cocaine class were more likely to report homelessness, sharing works, unprotected sex, public injection, and to be HCV positive. Compared to both Heroin-Dominant and Heroin/Cocaine classes, the Methamphetamine-Dominant class were more likely to be male, Hispanic, gay or bisexual orientation, HIV positive, to report unprotected sex and sex with PWID. In addition, the lowest and highest syringe coverage were among those in the Heroin/Cocaine and Methamphetamine-Dominant classes, respectively. Existing interventions among this population to mitigate infectious disease risk, such as SSPs, can be a used to engage differing PWID populations. However, multi-component, targeted preventive interventions and need-based syringe distribution policies are required to further reduce HIV and HCV risk among various PWID populations.","Association;Bisexuals;Cocaine;Communicable Diseases;Female;Florida;Gays;HIV;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Heroin;Hispanics;Homelessness;Humans;Infections;Injections;Latent Class Analysis;Male;Methamphetamine;Needs;Opioid Crisis;Orientation;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Procedures;Program;Public Health;Report;Risk;Risk Behavior;Risk-Taking;Sex;Sexual Behavior;Solutions;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Syringes;Unsafe Sex;Work","Communicable Diseases;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use",Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32199548,2020,Psychosocial intervention utilization and substance abuse treatment outcomes in a multisite sample of individuals who use opioids.,"There are several relatively safe and effective FDA-approved medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Despite the existence of these medications, the rate of returning to opioid use after treatment is relatively high, underscoring the need for continued enhancement of treatments. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions paired with medication have been shown to improve OUD treatment outcomes. However, studies have yet to conclusively examine the distinct effects of the most widely utilized psychosocial treatment modalities. The current study will investigate the relationship between individual counseling, group therapy, and 12-Step participation and illicit opioid abstinence at the end of treatment, 1 and 3 months after treatment. A secondary analysis was conducted with data from a sample of 570 individuals diagnosed with OUD who were recruited from eight substance abuse treatment centers in the United States. Participants were enrolled in a two-group randomized, controlled trial testing buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone for OUD. A two-level hierarchical linear growth model was used to examine the effects of individual counseling, group therapy, and 12-Step participation on illicit opioid abstinence (urinanalyses) 1- and 3-months post-treatment. Hours of individual counseling and 12-Step participation significantly predicted abstinence at follow-up (p &lt; .001, b = -0.59, 95% CI [0.42, 0.74]; p &lt; .01, b = -0.05, 95% CI [0.92, 0.98]). There was a significant interaction between individual counseling and 12-Step participation (p &lt; .01, b = -0.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.10]). Additionally, participant age and employment status were significant predictors of illicit opioid abstinence (p &lt; .01, b = -0.02, 95% CI [0.97, 0.99]; p &lt; .01, b = -0.38, 95% CI [0.52, 0.90]). Hours of group therapy was not found to significantly predict illicit opioid abstinence. Findings suggest that greater levels of individual therapy and 12-Step participation may be beneficial for individuals receiving medication treatment for OUD.","Aftercare;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Counseling;Employment Status;Growth;Humans;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Psychosocial Intervention;Randomized Controlled Trial;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Therapeutics;Therapy, Group;Treatment Outcome;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Twelve years after its completion, this paper aims to examine whether and how the WTS contributed to knowledge in the field of trauma and addictions and inspired community treatment programs (CTPs) to train staff to identify and provide trauma-related services. We present findings from two different analyses that explored longer term study impacts on treatment and dissemination: (1) a post-study site survey covering 4 domains from 4/7 programs that participated in delivering the WTS to evaluate their perceptions of study impact on their treatment community; and (2) an analysis of citations of its publications to determine impact on the scientific community. Surveys from responding sites indicated that participation in the study significantly increased their agencies'' awareness of the need to take a focused approach to treating trauma issues in this population. Specifically, these sites increased their commitment to using skills-based trauma treatment with the study's target population of female patients with SUD and trauma histories, as well as expanding it to other groups affected by trauma.

32220408,2020,Increasing collaboration on substance use disorder research with primary care practices through the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network.,"The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) called for its national nodes to promote the translation of evidence-based interventions from substance use disorder (SUD) research into clinical practices. This collaborative demonstration project engaged CTN-affiliated practice-based research networks (PBRNs) in research that describes aspects of opioid prescribing in primary care. Six PBRNs queried electronic health records from a convenience sample of 134 practices (84 participants) to identify the percent of adult patients with an office visit who were prescribed an opioid medication from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016, and, of those, the percent also prescribed a sedative in that year. Seven PBRNs sent an e-mail survey to a convenience sample of 108 practices (58 participants) about their opioid management policies and procedures during the project year. Of 561,017 adult patients with a visit to one of the 84 clinics in the project year, 22.9% (PBRN range 3.1%-25.4%) were prescribed opioid medications, and 52.1% (PBRN range 8.5%-60.6%) of those were prescribed a sedative in the same year. Of the 58 practices returning a survey (45.3% response rate), 98.1% had formal written treatment agreements for chronic opioid therapy, 68.5% had written opioid prescribing policies, and 43.4% provided reports to providers with feedback on opioid management. Only 24.1% were providing buprenorphine for OUD.

The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), launched in 1999 by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, has supported a growing line of research that leverages digital technologies to glean new insights into SUDs and provide science-based therapeutic tools to a diverse array of persons with SUDs. This manuscript provides an overview of the breadth and impact of research conducted in the realm of digital health within the CTN. This work has included the CTN's efforts to systematically embed digital screeners for SUDs into general medical settings to impact care models across the nation. This work has also included a pivotal multi-site clinical trial conducted on the CTN platform, whose data led to the very first ""prescription digital therapeutic"" authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SUDs. Further CTN research includes the study of telehealth to increase capacity for science-based SUD treatment in rural and under-resourced communities. In addition, the CTN has supported an assessment of the feasibility of detecting cocaine-taking behavior via smartwatch sensing. And, the CTN has supported the conduct of clinical trials entirely online (including the recruitment of national and hard-to-reach/under-served participant samples online, with remote intervention delivery and data collection). Further, the CTN is supporting innovative work focused on the use of digital health technologies and data analytics to identify digital biomarkers and understand the clinical trajectories of individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). This manuscript concludes by outlining the many potential future opportunities to leverage the unique national CTN research network to scale-up the science on digital health to examine optimal strategies to increase the reach of science-based SUD service delivery models both within and outside of healthcare.","Behavior;Biomarkers;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Community;Data Analytics;Data Collection;Digital Technology;Drug Abuse;Future;Health;Health Care;Health Services Research;Humans;Manuscript;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);News;Opioid Use Disorder;Persons;Prescriptions;Research;Role;Scales;Science;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Technology, Health Care;Telehealth;Therapeutics;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration;Work",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32220410,2020,Documented opioid use disorder and its treatment in primary care patients across six U.S. health systems.,"The United States is in the middle of an opioid overdose epidemic, and experts are calling for improved detection of opioid use disorders (OUDs) and treatment with buprenorphine or extended release (XR) injectable naltrexone, which can be prescribed in general medical settings. To better understand the magnitude of opportunities for treatment among primary care (PC) patients, we estimated the prevalence of documented OUD and medication treatment of OUD among PC patients. This cross-sectional study included patients with ≥2 visits to PC clinics across 6 healthcare delivery systems who were ≥16 years of age during the study period (fiscal years 2014-2016). Diagnoses, prescriptions, and healthcare utilization were ascertained from electronic health records and insurance claims (5 systems that also offer health insurance). Documented OUDs were defined as ≥1 International Classification of Diseases code for OUDs (active or remission), and OUD treatment was defined as ≥1 prescription(s) for buprenorphine formulations indicated for OUD or naltrexone XR, during the 3-year study period. The prevalence of documented OUD and treatment (95% confidence intervals) across health systems were estimated, and characteristics of patients by treatment status were compared. Prevalence of OUD and OUD treatment were adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Combined results were also adjusted for site. Among 1,403,327 eligible PC patients, 54-62% were female and mean age ranged from 46 to 51 years across health systems. The 3-year prevalence of documented OUD ranged from 0.7-1.4% across the health systems. Among patients with documented OUD, the prevalence of medication treatment (primarily buprenorphine) varied across health systems: 3%, 12%, 16%, 20%, 22%, and 36%. The prevalence of documented OUD and OUD treatment among PC patients varied widely across health systems. The majority of PC patients with OUD did not have evidence of treatment with buprenorphine or naltrexone XR, highlighting opportunities for improved identification and treatment in medical settings. These results can inform initiatives aimed at improving treatment of OUD in PC. Future research should focus on why there is such variation and how much of the variation can be addressed by improving access to medication treatment.","Access To Medicines;Buprenorphine;Confidence Intervals;Cross-Sectional Studies;Delivery of Health Care;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Epidemics;Ethnic Groups;Female;Future;Gender;Health;Health Care;Humans;ICD Codes;Injectables;Insurance;Insurance, Health;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Research;Therapeutics;United States",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32220411,2020,Service utilization and chronic condition outcomes among primary care patients with substance use disorders and co-occurring chronic conditions.,"Patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) often present with co-occurring chronic conditions in primary care. Despite the high co-occurrence of chronic medical conditions and SUD, little is known about whether chronic condition outcomes or related service utilization in primary care varies between patients with versus without documented SUDs. This study examined whether having a SUD influenced the use of primary care services and common chronic condition outcomes for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. A longitudinal cohort observational study examined electronic health record data from 21 primary care clinics in Washington and Idaho to examine differences in service utilization and clinical outcomes for diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in patients with and without a documented SUD diagnosis. Differences between patients with and without documented SUD diagnoses were compared over a three-year window for clinical outcome measures, including hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index, as well as service outcome measures, including number of encounters with primary care and co-located behavioral health providers, and orders for prescription opioids. Adult patients (N = 10,175) diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or obesity before the end of 2014, and who had ≥2 visits across a three-year window including at least one visit in 2014 (baseline) and at least one visit occurring 12 months or longer after the 2014 visit (follow-up) were examined. Patients with SUD diagnoses and co-occurring chronic conditions were seen by providers more frequently than patients without SUD diagnoses (p's &lt; 0.05), and patients with SUD diagnoses were more likely to be prescribed opioid medications. Chronic condition outcomes were no different for patients with versus without SUD diagnoses. Despite the higher visit rates to providers in primary care, a majority of patients with SUD diagnoses and chronic medical conditions in primary care did not get seen by co-located behavioral health providers, who can potentially provide and support evidence informed care for both SUD and chronic conditions. Patients with chronic medical conditions also were more likely to get prescribed opioids if they had an SUD diagnosis. Care pathway innovations for SUDs that include greater utilization of evidence-informed co-treatment of SUDs and chronic conditions within primary care settings may be necessary for improving care overall for patients with comorbid SUDs and chronic conditions.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Blood Pressure;Body Mass Index;Chronic Disease;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Glycated Hemoglobin A;Health;Humans;Hypertension;Idaho;Obesity;Observational Study;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Overall;Patients;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Services Utilization;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Washington",Chronic Disease;Hypertension;Obesity;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32220412,2020,Using a health information technology survey to explore the availability of addiction treatment data in the electronic health records: A National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network study.,"Healthcare data from electronic health records (EHRs) and related health information technology (IT) tools are critical data sources for pragmatic clinical trials and observational studies aimed at producing real-world evidence. To unlock the full potential of such data to advance science, the data must be complete and in structured formats to facilitate research use. A Health IT survey was conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to explore information related to data completeness and presence of unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes, free text) for conducting the EHR-based research for substance use disorders (SUDs). The analysis was based on 36 participants from 36 facilities located in 14 states and affiliated with the CTN. The mean age of the participants (n = 34) was 48.0 years (SD = 9.8). Of the participants enrolled, 50.0% were female and 82.4% were white. Participants' facilities were from four census-defined regions (South 35.3%, Northeast 29.4%, West 20.6%, Midwest 11.8%, Missing 2.9%) and represented diverse settings. The EHR was used by all surveyed facilities including 17 different kinds of EHR platforms or vendors, and 17.6% (n = 6) of surveyed facilities also used a separate EHR for behavioral health care (e.g., SUD care). Paper records were also used by 76.5% of surveyed facilities for clinical care (e.g., for health risk appraisal questionnaires, substance use screening or assessment, check-in screening, substance use specific intervention/treatment or referral, or labs/testing). The prevalence of using a patient portal, practice management system, and mHealth for patient care was 76.5%, 50.0%, and 29.4%, respectively. While results are descriptive in nature, they reveal the heterogeneity in the existing EHRs and frequent use of paper records to document patient care tasks, especially for SUD care. The use of a separate EHR for behavioral healthcare also suggests the challenge of obtaining complete EHR data to support research for SUDs. Much EHR development, integration, and standardization needs to be done especially in regard to SUD treatment to facilitate research across disparate healthcare systems.","Censuses;Clinical Trial;Common Data Elements;Data Sources;Drug Abuse;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Health Information Technology;Health Risk Appraisal;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Laboratories;Medical Informatics;Mobile Health;Nature;Needs;Observational Study;Paper;Patient Care;Patient Portals;Practice Management;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Prevalence;Questionnaires;Records;Referral;Research;Research Design;Science;Screening;Standardization;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Vendors;Whites",Drug Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32291723,2020,Opioid Agonist Therapy During Hospitalization Within the Veterans Health Administration: a Pragmatic Retrospective Cohort Analysis.,"Hospitalization of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing, yet little is known about opioid agonist therapy (OAT: methadone and buprenorphine) administration during admission. Describe and examine patient- and hospital-level characteristics associated with OAT receipt during hospitalization in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). A total of 12,407 unique patients, ≥ 18 years old, with an OUD-related ICD-10 diagnosis within 12 months prior to or during index hospitalization in fiscal year 2017 from 109 VHA hospitals in the continental U.S. OAT received during hospitalization. Few admissions received OAT (n = 1914; 15%) and when provided it was most often for withdrawal management (n = 834; 7%). Among patients not on OAT prior to admission who survived hospitalization (n = 10,969), 2.0% (n = 203) were newly initiated on OAT with linkage to care after hospital discharge. Hospitals varied in the frequency of OAT delivery (range, 0 to 43% of qualified admissions). Patients with pre-admission OAT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 15.30; 95% CI [13.2, 17.7]), acute OUD diagnosis (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI [1.99, 2.66]), and male gender (AOR 1.52; 95% CI [1.16, 2.01]) had increased odds of OAT receipt. Patients who received non-OAT opioids (AOR 0.53; 95% CI [0.46, 0.61]) or surgical procedures (AOR 0.75; 95% CI [0.57, 0.99]) had decreased odds of OAT receipt. Large-sized (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI [1.39, 3.00]) and medium-sized (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI [1.33, 2.70]) hospitals were more likely to provide OAT. In a sample of VHA inpatient medical admissions, OAT delivery was infrequent, varied across the health system, and was associated with specific patient and hospital characteristics. Policy and educational interventions should promote hospital-based OAT delivery.","Administration;Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Analysis, Cohort;Avena;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Diagnosis;Gender;Health;Hospital Medicine;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-10;Index;Inpatients;Male;Methadone;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Admission;Patients;Policy;Retrospective Studies;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Therapeutics;Veterans Health",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32391893,2020,Barriers and Facilitators to Clinician Readiness to Provide Emergency Department-Initiated Buprenorphine.,"Treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine decreases opioid use and prevents morbidity and mortality. Emergency departments (EDs) are an important setting for buprenorphine initiation for patients with untreated OUD; however, readiness varies among ED clinicians. To characterize barriers and facilitators of readiness to initiate buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD in the ED and identify opportunities to promote readiness across multiple clinician types. Using data collected from April 1, 2018, to January 11, 2019, this mixed-methods formative evaluation grounded in the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework included 4 geographically diverse academic EDs. Attending physicians (n = 113), residents (n = 107), and advanced practice clinicians (APCs) (n = 48) completed surveys electronically distributed to all ED clinicians (n = 396). A subset of participants (n = 74) also participated in 1 of 11 focus group discussions. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2018, to February 22, 2020. Clinician readiness to initiate buprenorphine and provide referral for ongoing treatment for patients with OUD treated in the ED was assessed using a visual analog scale. Responders (268 of 396 [67.7%]) were dichotomized as less ready (scores 0-6) or most ready (scores 7-10). An ED-adapted Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment (ORCA) and 11 focus groups were used to assess ratings and perspectives on evidence and context-related factors to promote ED-initiated buprenorphine with referral for ongoing treatment, respectively. Among the 268 survey respondents (153 of 260 were men [58.8%], with a mean [SD] of 7.1 [9.8] years since completing formal training), 56 (20.9%) indicated readiness to initiate buprenorphine for ED patients with OUD. Nine of 258 (3.5%) reported Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 training completion. Compared with those who were less ready, clinicians who were most ready to initiate buprenorphine had higher mean scores across all ORCA Evidence subscales (3.50 [95% CI, 3.35-3.65] to 4.33 [95% CI, 4.13-4.53] vs 3.11 [95% CI, 3.03-3.20] to 3.60 [95% CI, 3.49-3.70]; P &lt; .001) and on the Slack Resources of the ORCA Context subscales (3.32 [95% CI, 3.08-3.55] vs 3.0 [95% CI, 2.87-3.12]; P = .02). Barriers to ED-initiated buprenorphine included lack of training and experience in treating OUD with buprenorphine, concerns about ability to link to ongoing care, and competing needs and priorities for ED time and resources. Facilitators to ED-initiated buprenorphine included receiving education and training, development of local departmental protocols, and receiving feedback on patient experiences and gaps in quality of care. Only a few ED clinicians had a high level of readiness to initiate buprenorphine; however, many expressed a willingness to learn with sufficient supports. Efforts to promote adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine will require clinician and system-level changes.","Ability;Adoption;Adult;Buprenorphine;Drug Dependence;Education;Emergency Service, Hospital;Feedback;Female;Focus Groups;Health Services;Humans;Male;Men;Methods;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Mortality;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Quality of Health Care;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Research;Resources;Respondents;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Visual Analog Scale",Drug Dependence;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Participants (N = 570; 30% female) entering a comparative effectiveness medication trial of buprenorphine vs extended-release naltrexone. Differences in clinical characteristics in emerging adult vs older participants were similar across genders. However, women 26+ years reported more mental health problems compared with women ≤25, while men ≤25 years reported more mental health problems compared with men 26+ years. Different strategies for emerging adult and older patients seeking OUD treatment may be necessary to address psychiatric comorbidities that differ across genders in this population. Comprehensive psychiatric assessment should be systematically included in OUD treatment for all genders. Treatment should focus on the emerging adult developmental phase when appropriate, with psychiatric treatment tailored for women and men, separately, across the lifespan.

32563846,2020,Depression history as a predictor of outcomes during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment of prescription opioid use disorder.,"In the multi-site Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study (POATS), the best predictor of successful opioid use outcome was lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The primary aim of this secondary analysis of data from POATS was to empirically assess two explanations for this counterintuitive finding. The POATS study was a national, 10-site randomized controlled trial (N = 360 enrolled in the 12-week buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance treatment phase) sponsored by the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. We evaluated how the presence of a history of depression influences opioid use outcome (negative urine drug assays). Using adjusted logistic regression models, we tested the hypotheses that 1) a reduction in depressive symptoms and 2) greater motivation and engagement in treatment account for the association between depression history and good treatment outcome. Although depressive symptoms decreased significantly throughout treatment (p &lt;.001), this improvement was not associated with opioid outcomes (aOR = 0.98, ns). Reporting a goal of opioid abstinence at treatment entry was also not associated with outcomes (aOR = 1.39, ns); however, mutual-help group participation was associated with good treatment outcomes (aOR = 1.67, p &lt;.05). In each of these models, lifetime major depressive disorder remained associated with good outcomes (aORs = 1.63-1.82, ps = .01-.055). Findings are consistent with the premise that greater engagement in treatment is associated with good opioid outcomes. Nevertheless, depression history continues to be associated with good opioid outcomes in adjusted models. More research is needed to understand how these factors could improve treatment outcomes for those with opioid use disorder.","Association;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Symptoms;Diagnosis;Goals;History;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Motivation;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Urine","Depressive Disorder, Major;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32569355,2021,Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy in the Hospital Is Associated With Linkage to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Care for Persons Living With HIV and Substance Use Disorder.,"Studies have demonstrated benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the day of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing or at first clinical visit. The hospital setting is understudied for immediate ART initiation. CTN0049, a linkage-to-care randomized clinical trial, enrolled 801 persons living with HIV (PLWH) and substance use disorder (SUD) from 11 hospitals across the United States. This secondary analysis examined factors related to initiating (including reinitiating) ART in the hospital and its association with linkage to HIV care, frequency of outpatient care visits, retention, and viral suppression. Of 801 participants, 124 (15%) initiated ART in the hospital, with more than two-thirds of these participants (80/124) initiating ART for the first time. Time to first HIV care visit among those who initiated ART in the hospital and those who did not was 29 and 54 days, respectively (P = .0145). Hospital initiation of ART was associated with increased frequency of HIV outpatient care visits at 6 and 12 months. There was no association with ART initiation in the hospital and retention and viral suppression over a 12-month period. Participants recruited in Southern hospitals were less likely to initiate ART in the hospital (P &lt; .001). Previous research demonstrated benefits of immediate ART initiation, yet this approach is not widely implemented. Research findings suggest that starting ART in the hospital is beneficial for increasing linkage to HIV care and frequency of visits for PLWH and SUD.

32590210,2020,Multiple drug use disorder diagnoses among drug-involved hospitalizations in the United States: Results from the 2016 National Inpatient Sample.,"Having more than one drug use disorders (DUDs) is an increasing public health concern, but it has been understudied. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevalence and patterns of coexisting DUD diagnoses among inpatient hospitalizations due to DUD in the United States. Data were from the 2016 National Inpatient Sample and included hospitalizations with a principal DUD diagnosis for patients aged ≥18 years (i.e., drug-involved hospitalizations, unweighted n = 31,707). The DUD diagnosis profile was categorized into three groups: single, two, and three or more DUD diagnoses. Generalized ordered logit models were used to examine correlates of DUD diagnosis groups. Among drug-involved hospitalizations, approximately 50.1 % had multiple coexisting DUD diagnoses (2 DUD diagnoses, 32.1 %; ≥3 DUD diagnoses, 18.0 %). Particularly, opioid use disorder accounted for 58.6 % of drug-involved hospitalizations. Among specific opioid-involved hospitalizations, about 51.2 % had multiple DUD diagnoses. The most common secondary DUD diagnoses among opioid-involved hospitalizations included cocaine (21.7 %), cannabis (18.5 %), and sedatives (18.1 %). Adjusted analyses showed that being aged 18-25 years (vs. ≥ 26), living in areas with the lowest quartile of household income (vs. highest), and having a secondary diagnosis of mental disorders or tobacco/alcohol use disorder were associated with increased odds of having multiple DUD diagnoses in the total sample and in the opioid subsample. Findings suggest that healthcare providers should increase the awareness of multiple DUDs while treating patients with DUD, especially those with opioid use disorder.

32619868,2020,Extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone to treat opioid use disorder among black adults.,"Few studies examine the effectiveness of treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) among Black individuals despite recent evidence suggesting opioid overdose death rates are, in some cases, highest and increasing at a faster rate among Black people compared to other racial/ethnic groups. This secondary analysis study investigated treatment preference, retention, and relapse rates amongst a subgroup of 73 Black participants with OUD (81% male, mean age 39.05, SD = 11.80) participating in a 24-week multisite randomized clinical trial (""X:BOT"") comparing the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) between 2014 and 2017. Chi-square analyses were used to investigate treatment preference assessed at baseline, and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate differences in the odds of retention and relapse assessed over the 24-week course of treatment between treatment groups. Our findings suggest no differences in preference for XR-NTX versus BUP-NX. However, similar to the parent trial, there was an induction hurdle such that only 59.5% of those randomized to XR-NTX successfully initiated medication compared to 91.6% of those randomized to BUP-NX (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.52). No significant differences were found in treatment retention (intention-to-treat: OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.43, 3.28; per-protocol [i.e., those who initiated medication]: OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.20, 1.82) or relapse rates between treatment groups (intention-to-treat: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.57, 4.13; per-protocol: OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.23, 2.06). Although there is a significant initiation hurdle with XR-NTX, once inducted, both medications appear similar in effectiveness, but as in the main study, dropout rates were high.

32652077,2020,Forecasting Opioid Use Disorder at 25 Years of Age in 16-Year-Old Adolescents.,"To evaluate the accuracy of detecting 16-year-old male (n = 465) and female (n = 162) youths who subsequently manifest opioid use disorder (OUD) at 25 years of age. We hypothesized that the combined measures of 2 components of etiology, heritable risk, and substance use, accurately detect youths who develop OUD. Heritable risk was measured by the transmissible liability index (TLI). Severity of the prodrome presaging OUD was quantified by the revised Drug Use Screening Inventory containing the consumption frequency index (CFI) documenting substance use events during the past month and the overall problem density (OPD) score indicating co-occurring biopsychosocial problems. Diagnosis of OUD was formulated by a clinical committee based on results of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition in conjunction with medical and social history records. Bivariate analysis shows that the TLI, CFI, and OPD scores at 16 years of age predict OUD at 25 years. Multivariate modeling indicates that the TLI combined with the CFI predict OUD with 86% accuracy (sensitivity = 87%; specificity = 62%). The TLI and CFI at 16 years of age mediate the association between parental substance use disorder and OUD in offspring at 25 years of age, indicating that these measures respectively evaluate risk and prodrome. These results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying youths requiring intervention to prevent OUD.",Adolescent;Adult;Association;Consumption;Diagnosis;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Drug Dependence;Early Diagnosis;Female;Forecasting;History;Humans;Index;Interview;Inventories;Logistic Models;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Measures;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Parents;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Records;Risk;Risk Assessment;Screening;Sensitivity;Sensitivity and Specificity;Specificity;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;Youth,Drug Dependence;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Pediatr,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32697170,2020,Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train the Trainer (SCOUTT) initiative: Expanding access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder within Veterans Health Administration facilities.,"The US is confronted with a rise in opioid use disorder (OUD), opioid misuse, and opioid-associated harms. Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone-is the gold standard treatment for OUD. MOUD reduces illicit opioid use, mortality, criminal activity, healthcare costs, and high-risk behaviors. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has invested in several national initiatives to encourage access to MOUD treatment. Despite these efforts, by 2017, just over a third of all Veterans diagnosed with OUD received MOUD. VHA OUD specialty care is often concentrated in major hospitals throughout the nation and access to this care can be difficult due to geography or patient choice. Recognizing the urgent need to improve access to MOUD care, in the Spring of 2018, the VHA initiated the Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder, Train the Trainer (SCOUTT) Initiative to facilitate access to MOUD in VHA non-SUD care settings. The SCOUTT Initiative's primary goal is to increase MOUD prescribing in VHA primary care, mental health, and pain clinics by training providers working in those settings on how to provide MOUD and to facilitate implementation by providing an ongoing learning collaborative. Thirteen healthcare providers from each of the 18 VHA regional networks across the VHA were invited to implement the SCOUTT Initiative within one facility in each network. We describe the goals and initial activities of the SCOUTT Initiative leading up to a two-day national SCOUTT Initiative conference attended by 246 participants from all 18 regional networks in the VHA.

32697171,2020,Medication treatment for opioid use disorder and community pharmacy: Expanding care during a national epidemic and global pandemic.,"Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone and buprenorphine, are effective strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reducing overdose risk. MOUD treatment rates continue to be low across the US, and currently, some evidence suggests access to evidence-based treatment is becoming increasingly difficult for those with OUD as a result of the 2019 novel corona virus (COVID-19). A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD. US policymakers, regulators, and practitioners must work to facilitate this advancement of community pharmacy-based through research, education, practice, and industry. Advancing community pharmacy-based MOUD for leading clinical management of OUD and dispensation of treatment medications will afford the US a critical innovation for addressing the opioid epidemic, fallout from COVID-19, and getting individuals the care they need.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Australia;Betacoronavirus;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;Canada;Community Pharmacies;Community Pharmacy Services;Coronavirus Infections;Delivery of Health Care;Education;Epidemics;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Industry;Methadone;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pandemics;Pharmacists;Pneumonia, Viral;Research;Risk;SARS-CoV-2;Scope of Practice;Therapeutics;Trust;United Kingdom;United States;Work","COVID-19;Coronavirus Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pneumonia, Viral",Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32732682,2021,Rise in Presence of Methamphetamine in Oral Fluid Toxicology Tests Among Outpatients in a Large Healthcare Setting in the Northeast.,"To examine changes in presence of methamphetamine in toxicology testing among outpatients receiving healthcare in Boston, Massachusetts. A serial cross-sectional study of oral fluid drug test results over a 6-year period of all patient specimens submitted for testing as part of routine care across an academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts and affiliated primary care practices which has roughly 48,000 admissions and 500,000 primary care visits per year. All samples were subjected to definitive drug testing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for fentanyl, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM, metabolite of heroin), benzoylecgonine (metabolite of cocaine), cocaine, and methamphetamine. We compared positive rates and change over time across the same calendar months (February to July) of 6 consecutive years from 2014 to 2019. Total of 17,303 oral fluid samples collected from outpatients receiving routine healthcare across 6 years were analyzed. Samples showing presence of methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl increased over the study period, whereas 6-MAM presence decreased. From 2014 to 2019 samples with methamphetamine present increased from 0.9% to 5.1% and samples with 6-MAM present decreased from 9.5% to 2.8%. Fentanyl was added to the testing panel in 2017. In 2019, 15.7% of samples had fentanyl present. Polysubstance use was common; 44% of samples with methamphetamine also showed cocaine or benzoylecgonine, 25% showed fentanyl, and 3% showed 6-MAM presence. Presence of methamphetamine in oral fluid toxicology tests increased from 2014 to 2019 across a sample of outpatients receiving healthcare in Boston, Massachusetts. Regions of the country with high rates of opioid overdose may need to integrate harm reduction and addiction treatment resources for stimulant use disorder in addition to opioid use disorder.","Academic Medical Centers;Boston;Calendar;Chromatography, Liquid;Cocaine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Delivery of Health Care;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Health Care;Heroin;Humans;Massachusetts;Methamphetamine;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Outpatients;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Primary Health Care;Resources;Substance Abuse Detection;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Abuse,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32761292,2021,Dental Care Utilization of Hospitalized Persons Living with HIV and Substance Use.,"People living with HIV (PLWH) who use drugs experience worse health outcomes than their non-using counterparts. Little is known about how often they seek dental care and the factors that influence their utilization. PLWH with substance use disorders who were inpatients at 11 urban hospitals (n = 801) participated in a National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network study to improve engagement in HIV outcomes. Dental care utilization at each time point during the study period (baseline, 6 months and/or 12 months) was assessed (n = 657). Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to examine factors associated with dental care utilization. Over half (59.4%) reported not having received any dental care at any timepoint. Participants with less than high school education had lower odds of reporting dental care utilization than those with more than education (aOR = 0.60 [95% CI 0.37-0.99], p = 0.0382). Participants without health insurance also had lower odds of reporting dental care utilization than those with insurance (aOR = 0.50 [95% CI 0.331-0.76], p = 0.0012). Higher food insecurity was associated with having recent dental care utilization (OR = 1.03 [95% CI 1.00, 1.05], p = 0.0359). Additionally, those from Southern states were less likely to report dental care utilization (aOR = 0.55 [95% CI 0.38, 0.79], p = 0.0013). Having health insurance and education are key factors associated with use of dental care for PLWH with substance use disorders. The association between food insecurity and dental care utilization among this population suggests the need for further exploration.","Association;Clinical Trial;Dental Care;Education;Food Insecurity;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;Hospitalization;Hospitals, Urban;Humans;Inpatients;Insurance;Insurance, Health;Logistic Regression;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Needs;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Report;Schools;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Time",Drug Abuse;HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Community Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32777692,2020,Health-related quality of life and opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy: A secondary analysis of a clinical trial.,"To examine the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) of persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) seeking treatment in an inpatient detoxification or short-term residential setting; continuing treatment as outpatients. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial (N = 508) where participants were randomized to extended-release naltrexone or buprenorphine-naloxone for the prevention of opioid relapse. We used a generalized structural equation regression mixture model to identify associations of HRQoL (EQ-5D) trajectories, including latent characteristics, over the 24-week trial and 36-week follow-up period, among participants who reported HRQoL beyond baseline. This novel framework accounted for baseline and time-varying characteristics, while simultaneously identifying latent classes. We identified two subpopulations: HRQoL ""pharmacotherapy responsive"" (82.3 %) and HRQoL ""characteristic sensitive"" (17.7 %). The pharmacotherapy responsive subpopulation was characterized by a shortterm HRQoL improvement and then stable HRQoL over time, and by a positive association between HRQoL and receiving pharmacotherapy in the past 30 days. The characteristic sensitive subpopulation was characterized by an initial improvement in HRQoL with a gradual decline over time, and no significant HRQoL response to pharmacotherapy. HRQoL changes over time in this subpopulation were more influenced by baseline demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial characteristics. Our findings suggest that while HRQoL may be improved and sustained through targeted efforts to promote use of pharmacotherapy for many persons with OUD, an identifiable subpopulation may require additional services that address socioeconomic and psychosocial issues to achieve HRQoL benefits. Our analysis provides insight for improving individualized care for persons with opioid use disorder seeking treatment.","Address;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Demography;Drug Therapy;Female;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Humans;Inpatients;Latent Class Analysis;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Persons;Quality of Life;Relapse;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32782084,2020,Use of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants Among Emergency Department Patients With Untreated Opioid Use Disorder.,"Concurrent use of amphetamine-type stimulants among individuals with opioid use disorder can exacerbate social and medical harms, including overdose risk. The study evaluated rates of amphetamine-type stimulant use among patients with untreated opioid use disorder presenting at emergency departments in Baltimore, MD; New York, NY; Cincinnati, OH; and Seattle, WA. Emergency department (ED) patients with untreated opioid use disorder (N=396) and enrolled between February 2017 and January 2019 in a multisite hybrid type III implementation science study were evaluated for concurrent amphetamine-type stimulant use. Individuals with urine tests positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, or both were compared with amphetamine-type stimulant-negative patients. Overall, 38% of patients (150/396) were amphetamine-type stimulant positive; none reported receiving prescribed amphetamine or methamphetamine medications. Amphetamine-type stimulant-positive versus -negative patients were younger: mean age was 36 years (SD 10 years) versus 40 years (SD 12 years), 69% (104/150) versus 46% (114/246) were white, 65% (98/150) versus 54% (132/246) were unemployed, 67% (101/150) versus 49 (121/246) had unstable housing, 47% (71/150) versus 25% (61/245) reported an incarceration during 1 year before study admission, 60% (77/128) versus 45% (87/195) were hepatitis C positive, 79% (118/150) versus 47% (115/245) reported drug injection during 1 month before the study admission, and 42% (62/149) versus 29% (70/244) presented to the ED for an injury. Lower proportions of amphetamine-type stimulant-positive patients had cocaine-positive urine test results (33% [50/150] versus 52% [129/246]) and reported seeking treatment for substance use problems as a reason for their ED visit (10% [14/148] versus 19% [46/246]). All comparisons were statistically significant at P&lt;.05 with the false discovery rate correction. Amphetamine-type stimulant use among ED patients with untreated opioid use disorder was associated with distinct sociodemographic, social, and health factors. Improved ED-based screening, intervention, and referral protocols for patients with opioid use disorder and amphetamine-type stimulant use are needed.","Adult;Amphetamine;Amphetamine-Related Disorders;Baltimore;Case-Control Studies;Central Nervous System Stimulants;Cocaine;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Health;Hepatitis C;Housing;Humans;Hybrids;Implementation Science;Injections;Injuries;Male;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;New York;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Referral;Risk;Screening;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Therapeutics;United States;Urine;Whites",Amphetamine-Related Disorders;Drug Overdose;Hepatitis C;Injuries;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse;Substance Use,Ann Emerg Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32842044,2020,Relative Cost Differences of Initial Treatment Strategies for Newly Diagnosed Opioid Use Disorder: A Cohort Study.,"Relative costs of care among treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are unknown. We identified a cohort of 40,885 individuals with a new diagnosis of OUD in a large national de-identified claims database covering commercially insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees. We assigned individuals to 1 of 6 mutually exclusive initial treatment pathways: (1) Inpatient Detox/Rehabilitation Treatment Center; (2) Behavioral Health Intensive, intensive outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Services; (3) Methadone or Buprenorphine; (4) Naltrexone; (5) Behavioral Health Outpatient Services, or; (6) No Treatment. We assessed total costs of care in the initial 90 day treatment period for each strategy using a differences in differences approach controlling for baseline costs. Within 90 days of diagnosis, 94.8% of individuals received treatment, with the initial treatments being: 15.8% for Inpatient Detox/Rehabilitation Treatment Center, 4.8% for Behavioral Health Intensive, Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Services, 12.5% for buprenorphine/methadone, 2.4% for naltrexone, and 59.3% for Behavioral Health Outpatient Services. Average unadjusted costs increased from $3250 per member per month (SD $7846) at baseline to $5047 per member per month (SD $11,856) in the 90 day follow-up period. Compared with no treatment, initial 90 day costs were lower for buprenorphine/methadone [Adjusted Difference in Differences Cost Ratio (ADIDCR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.80], naltrexone (ADIDCR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.67), and behavioral health outpatient (ADIDCR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.66). Costs were higher for inpatient detox (ADIDCR 2.30; 95% CI, 1.88-2.83).

32851876,2020,Variants of opioid genes and response to treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone in Caucasians.,"Background: Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), an FDA-approved treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), combines buprenorphine (a partial mu/kappa agonist) with naloxone (a mu/ kappa antagonist). Extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX; a mu receptor antagonist and kappa receptor partial agonist) is also an FDA-approved treatment for OUD. However, while some patients respond well to these medications, many others leave treatment and relapse. Objectives: Determine whether gene variants in the opioid gene system are associated with better or worse treatment response. Methods: In a 24-week, multisite, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of daily, sublingual self-administration of BUP-NX versus monthly injection of XR-NTX conducted in the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network, DNA was collected and four opioid gene variants were evaluated: (1) mu opioid receptor 118A&gt;G; (2) 68-bp repeat in prodynorphin; (3) prodynorphin SNP rs910080; and (4) kappa opioid receptor SNP rs6473797. In non-Hispanic Caucasians (N = 334), two outcomes measures were assessed: received first dose (yes/no) and received last dose (yes/no). Separate logistic regressions were used to model each outcome measure as a function of treatment (XR-NTX vs BUP-NX), each gene variant, and their interaction. Results: There were no significant main effects of gene variant on receiving first dose or last dose. There were also no significant gene variant by treatment interactions. Conclusions: The outcome of treatment of OUD with medications is likely a complex function of multiple factors, including environmental, psychosocial, and possibly genetic, such that major effects of genetic variants may be unlikely.","Administration, Sublingual;Adult;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;DNA;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Abuse;Female;Genes;Genetics;Hispanics;Humans;Injections;Injections, Intramuscular;Logistic Regression;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Patients;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Relapse;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Whites",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32873500,2020,Young Adults Have Worse Outcomes Than Older Adults: Secondary Analysis of a Medication Trial for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Young adults are disproportionately affected by the current opioid crisis. Although medications for opioid use disorder are broadly effective, with reductions in morbidity and mortality, the particular effectiveness of medications for opioid use disorder among young adults is less well understood. This secondary analysis compared young adults (aged 18-25 years) with older adults (aged ≥26 years) in a large comparative effectiveness trial (""XBOT"") that randomized subjects to extended-release naltrexone or sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone for 6 months. Opioid relapse was defined by opioid use over four consecutive weeks or seven consecutive days, using urine testing and self-report. Among subjects in the intention-to-treat sample (n = 570, all randomized participants), a main effect of age group was found, with higher relapse rates among young adults (70.3%) compared with older adults (58.2%), with an odds ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval = 1.08-2.70), p = .02. In the per-protocol sample (n = 474, only participants who started medication), relapse rates were higher among young adults (66.3%) compared with older adults (50.8%), with an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% confidence interval = 1.19-3.06). Among the intention-to-treat sample, survival analysis revealed a significant time-by-age group interaction (p = .01) with more relapse over time in young adults. No significant interactions between age and medication group were detected. Young adults have increased rates of relapse compared with older adults, perhaps because of vulnerabilities that increase their risk for treatment dropout and medication nonadherence, regardless of medication assignment. These results suggest that specialized, developmentally informed interventions may be needed to improve retention and successful treatment of opioid use disorder among young adults.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Confidence Intervals;Delayed-Action Preparations;Female;Humans;Intention;Male;Medication Nonadherence;Morbidity;Mortality;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Odds Ratio;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Relapse;Risk;Self Report;Survival Analysis;Therapeutics;Time;Urine;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,J Adolesc Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

However, these initiatives are based on weak evidence which at present do not support the listing of cannabis or cannabinoids as a treatment for OUD. Nevertheless, studying the potential therapeutic applications of carefully chosen components of cannabis or cannabinoids to treat specific aspects of OUD is not without scientific merit. Given the high rates of treatment discontinuation among those taking medications for OUD, interventions that further improve clinical outcomes are especially needed. The potential therapeutic applications of cannabis and cannabinoids in the treatment of OUD are worthy of further study, but it should be conducted with the same rigor that we expect of all pharmaceutical products.

32911133,2020,"Cannabis use, other drug use, and risk of subsequent acute care in primary care patients.","Cannabis and other drug use is associated with adverse health events, but little is known about the association of routine clinical screening for cannabis or other drug use and acute care utilization. This study evaluated whether self-reported frequency of cannabis or other drug use was associated with subsequent acute care. This retrospective cohort study used EHR and claims data from 8 sites in Washington State that implemented annual substance use screening. Eligible adult primary care patients (N = 47,447) completed screens for cannabis (N = 45,647) and/or other drug use, including illegal drug use and prescription medication misuse, (N = 45,255) from 3/3/15-10/1/2016. Separate single-item screens assessed frequency of past-year cannabis and other drug use: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, daily/almost daily. An indicator of acute care utilization measured any urgent care, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations ≤19 months after screening. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models estimated risk of acute care. Patients were predominantly non-Hispanic White. Those reporting cannabis use less than monthly (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.21) or daily (HR = 1.24; 1.10-1.39) had greater risk of acute care during follow-up than those reporting no use. Patients reporting other drug use less than monthly (HR = 1.34; 1.13-1.59), weekly (HR = 2.21; 1.46-3.35), or daily (HR = 2.53; 1.86-3.45) had greater risk of acute care than those reporting no other drug use.

32915026,2020,Pain rehabilitation's dual power: Treatment for chronic pain and prevention of opioid-related risks.,"The purpose of this article is to provide a data-driven exploration of an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program (PRP) as a viable option for addressing the dual crises of chronic pain and opioid use. Psychologists are crucial providers in the PRP, in both intervention and leadership roles. There is well-established literature supporting pain rehabilitation as an effective treatment for chronic pain and functioning, but there are few studies examining the effects of pain rehabilitation on opioid misuse risk. We evaluated data from 60 patients with diverse chronic pain conditions who completed an interdisciplinary PRP to evaluate changes in pain, functioning (self-report and objective physical measure), psychological symptoms, and health-related quality of life. To evaluate the effect of pain rehabilitation on opioid-related risks, we examined opioid use and opioid misuse behaviors (measured by the Current Opioid Misuse Measure; COMM) pre- and posttreatment. Results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all outcomes, with medium effect sizes for pain severity and large effect sizes for functioning, psychological symptoms, and emotional quality of life. Fifty-eight percent of patients were on opioid medications at entry compared with 15% at discharge. Among patients who entered on opioids, mean COMM scores were significantly reduced from above the cutoff for misuse risk (M = 13.57) to below the cutoff (M = 5.86). Overall, this study provided strong support for pain rehabilitation as an effective treatment for chronic pain and related suffering, while also providing a prevention-based opportunity for reducing opioid-related risk.

33035229,2020,Differences in length of stay and discharge destination among patients with substance use disorders: The effect of Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT) consultation service.,"Addiction medicine consultation services (ACS) may improve outcomes of hospitalized patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Our aim was to examine the difference in length of stay and the hazard ratio for a routine hospital discharge between SUD patients receiving and not receiving ACS. Structured EHR data from 2018 of 1,900 adult patients with a SUD-related diagnostic code at an urban academic health center were examined among 35,541 total encounters. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit using a cause-specific approach to examine differences in hospital outcome (i.e., routine discharge, leaving against medical advice, in-hospital death, or transfer to another level of care). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, and comorbidities. Length of stay was shorter among encounters with a SUD that received a SUIT consultation versus those admissions that did not receive one (5.77 v. 6.54 days, p&lt;0.01). In adjusted analyses, admissions that received a SUIT consultation had a higher hazard of a routine discharge [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.16 (1.03-1.30)] compared to those not receiving a SUIT consultation. The SUIT consultation service was associated with a reduced length of stay and an increased hazard of a routine discharge. The SUIT model may serve as a benchmark and inform other health systems attempting to improve outcomes in SUD patient cohorts.","Addiction Medicine;Adult;Behavior, Addictive;Benchmarks;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Consultation;Death;Ethnic Groups;Female;Health;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Length of Stay;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Discharge;Patient Readmission;Patients;Proportional Hazards Models;Racial Stocks;Referral and Consultation;Sex;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders",Death;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,PLoS One,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33162260,2021,Patients' perspectives on initiating treatment with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX).,"The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) multisite comparative-effectiveness study (""X:BOT"") by Lee et al. (2018) found that, once initiated, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is as similarly safe and effective as sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). However, the detoxification hurdle makes XR-NTX much more difficult to initiate than BUP-NX. This hurdle highlights the need to better understand how patients transition from active opioid use to XR-NTX treatment. To explore patient-identified barriers and facilitators to initiating antagonist treatment (XR-NTX) within the context of an inpatient hospital setting and to reflect postdischarge experiences of those who did and did not initiate XR-NTX treatment. We used a convenience sampling strategy to identify study candidates, with the intention of recruiting approximately an equal number of medication-initiated and noninitiated patients. Study participants (N = 14) included 13 males and 1 female with OUD randomized to the XR-NTX arm of the X:BOT study at 1 of the 8 study sites. Seven participants in this sample initiated XR-NTX treatment, and seven did not. Each participant completed one semistructured qualitative interview. We analyzed transcripts using deductive and inductive approaches to conventional content analysis. Although the majority of participants viewed opioid blockade, once-monthly dosing, and no dependence or withdrawal as favorable attributes of XR-NTX, participant ambivalence and lack of familiarity with antagonist treatment were barriers to treatment initiation. The long duration of action and the perceived ""commitment"" to the medication (e.g., ""At the time, a month sounded like a year"") compounded the patients' concerns and ambivalence. The majority of those who initiated XR-NTX described it as an effective treatment for OUD, with treatment satisfaction and sustained abstinence emerging as central themes among this population. Some participants who did not successfully initiate XR-NTX expressed regret and a willingness to try XR-NTX in the future. Achieving full opioid detoxification is one, but not the only, barrier to initiating treatment with XR-NTX. Additional participant-identified barriers to XR-NTX initiation include fears and ambivalence regarding antagonist treatment. Once initiated, participants perceive XR-NTX to be an effective treatment for maintaining abstinence from opioids. XR-NTX appealed to participants due to the autonomy it affords with once-monthly dosing and no physical dependence.","Aftercare;Arm;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Abuse;Familiarity;Fear;Female;Future;Hospitals;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Intention;Interview;Male;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Discharge;Patient Transition;Patients;Population;Regret;Satisfaction;Therapeutics;Time",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33177437,2021,Participants' Treatment Perspectives on a Clinical Trial on the Use of Extended-Release Naltrexone for Substance Use Disorders: Considerations for Future Clinical Research.,"We undertook this study to understand participants' perceptions of their assigned treatment in a randomized control trial examining the use of extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for substance use disorders. Semi-structured qualitative interviews among 22 prospective and actual participants in a larger clinical trial examining the feasibility of extended-release naltrexone for both opioid and alcohol use disorders among people living with HIV. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Participants described their study experience as mostly positive, but also concurrently held or developed study medication apprehensions and misperceptions. First, some participants described apprehension, lack of control, and uneasiness regarding their assigned treatment. Second, some participants perceived their treatment as ""placebos"" and/or were convinced that their treatment was ineffective, shaping perceptions of impact on their substance use. Third, some participants perceived study treatments as cure-alls for substance use disorders. Participant perceptions of trial interventions may frame their experience and participation in clinical studies. These findings demonstrate the need for researchers and clinicians to consider how apprehension and a lack of medication receptivity may impact enrollment and participant autonomy. They also identify opportunities for greater community engagement in trial design and implementation in order to improve participant education about the nature of interventions and the potential of ongoing consent processes integrated throughout studies to promote participant understandings of study purposes and objectives.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Analgesics, Opioid;Clinical Study;Clinical Trial;Community;Comprehension;Delayed-Action Preparations;Education;Future;HIV;Humans;Interview;Naltrexone;Nature;Needs;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Perception;Persons;Placebos;Prospective Studies;Research;Research Personnel;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33250384,2021,Non-invasive brain stimulation as a tool to decrease chronic pain in current opiate users: A parametric evaluation of two promising cortical targets.,"Poorly controlled chronic pain can lead to non-prescription use of opiates, which is a growing crisis in our communities. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive therapeutic tool which has emerged as a potential treatment option for these patients. It is still unclear, however, if the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the motor cortex (MC) is a more effective treatment location. The purpose of this study was to directly compare the effects of DLPFC versus MC TMS on pain severity and the urge to use opiates among chronic pain patients. Twenty-two individuals with chronic pain currently using prescription opiates were randomized to receive 10, 3000 pulse sessions of 10 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) to the left DLPFC (110% resting motor threshold) or left MC (90% resting motor threshold). Multivariate linear models were used to evaluate the effect of TMS on pain and opiate use, including items from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) as well as subjective ratings of pain, distress, and the urge for opiates. Twenty participants (91%) completed all 10 treatment sessions and follow up visits. There was a main effect of stimulation site (F7,210 = 3.742, p = 0.001), wherein MC stimulation decreased pain interference significantly more than DLPFC stimulation (F1,216 = 8.447, p = 0.004). While both sites had comparable effect sizes on stress, pain, and discomfort, MC stimulation had larger effects on pain interference (Cohen's d: 0.7) and urge to use opiates (Cohen's d: 0.5) than DLPFC stimulation. These data suggest that the MC may be a promising target for decreasing opiate dependence and pain interference among chronic pain patients.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Brain;Chronic Pain;Community;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Female;Humans;Inventories;Lead;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Cortex;Opiate Alkaloids;Opiate Dependence;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain Measurement;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Prescriptions;Pulse;Rest;Therapeutics;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation;Treatment Outcome",Chronic Pain;Opiate Dependence;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33256535,2021,A Critical Review of the Social and Behavioral Contributions to the Overdose Epidemic.,"More than 750,000 people in the United States died from an overdose between 1999 and 2018; two-thirds of those deaths involved an opioid. In this review, we present trends in opioid overdose rates during this period and discuss how the proliferation of opioid prescribing to treat chronic pain, changes in the heroin and illegally manufactured opioid synthetics markets, and social factors, including deindustrialization and concentrated poverty, contributed to the rise of the overdose epidemic. We also examine how current policies implemented to address the overdose epidemic may have contributed to reducing prescription opioid overdoses but increased overdoses involving illegal opioids. Finally, we identify new directions for research to understand the causes and solutions to this critical public health problem, including research on heterogeneous policy effects across social groups, effective approaches to reduce overdoses of illegal opioids, and the role of social contexts in shaping policy implementation and impact.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Death;Epidemics;Heroin;Humans;Illicit Drugs;News;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Persons;Policy;Poverty;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Public Health;Research;Review;Role;Social Environment;Social Factors;Solutions;Supplies;United States",Chronic Pain;Death;Opiate Overdose,Annu Rev Public Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

33270549,2021,A hospital-wide initiative to redesign substance use disorder care: Impact on pharmacotherapy initiation.,"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in general medical settings remains underutilized. We evaluated 5 years of a hospital-wide SUD initiative which included an inpatient addiction consult team (ACT), low-threshold Bridge Clinic, recovery coaches, and office-based addiction treatment (OBAT) nurses. Methods: Naturalistic registry study. We calculated frequencies of patient contacts, types of substance use diagnoses, and medication treatment initiation and duration. Results: From 2014 to 2019, 7,036 unique patients were seen, including 4,959 by ACT, 1,197 in Bridge Clinic, 2,250 by a recovery coach, and 979 by an OBAT nurse. The median age was 47, 31% were women, 80% were white, 7% were black, 6% were Hispanic/Latinx, and 25% were experiencing homelessness. Alcohol use disorder was seen in 62%, opioid use disorder in 54%, cocaine use disorder in 29%, benzodiazepine use disorder in 14%, and stimulant use disorder in 7%. Co-occurring medical and psychiatric illnesses were common; 35% had hepatitis C, 59% depression, 66% anxiety, and 13% schizophrenia. 1,623 patients received a prescription for buprenorphine during the study period (42% of patients with OUD), 877 for oral naltrexone, and 163 for extended-release naltrexone. The mean length of continuous treatment was 178.4 days for buprenorphine, 47.7 days for oral naltrexone, and 1.29 injections for extended-release naltrexone.

METHODS Using data collected from 2/2017-1/2019 from participants enrolled in Project ED Health (CTN-0069), we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of patients with untreated moderate to severe OUD presenting to one of four EDs in Baltimore, New York City, Cincinnati, or Seattle. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates, and International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes related to opioid withdrawal, injection-related infection, other substance use, overdose, and OUD of those seeking and not seeking a referral to substance use treatment on presentation were compared using univariate analyses. RESULTS Among 394 study participants, 15.2 % (60/394) came to the ED seeking a referral to substance use treatment. No differences in age, gender, education, health insurance status or housing stability were detected between those seeking and not seeking referral to substance use treatment. Those seeking a referral to substance use treatment were less likely to have urine toxicology testing positive for amphetamine [17 % (10/60) vs 31 % (104/334), p = 0.023] and methamphetamine [23 % (14/60) vs 40 % (132/334), p = 0.017] compared to those not seeking a referral. CONCLUSION Most patients with untreated OUD seen in the EDs were not seeking a referral to substance use treatment. Active identification, treatment initiation, and coding may improve ED efforts to address untreated OUD.","Address;Adult;Amphetamine;Baltimore;Brief Interventions;Coding;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Gender;Health;Health Education;Housing;Humans;ICD-10;Infections;Injections;Insurance Coverage;International Classification of Diseases;Male;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;New York City;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Screening;Substance Use;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Urine;Young Adult",Drug Overdose;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We conducted a secondary analysis of a multi-site randomized trial comparing XR-NTX with sublingual BUP-NX treatment for opioid use disorder initiated during inpatient detoxification and continued in outpatient treatment. Urine testing data for non-study opioids from the last 22 weeks of the 24-week trial were analyzed in both a per-protocol sample (n = 474 participants who received at least one dose of medication) and a completers sample (n = 211 participants who received all XR-NTX doses or all BUP-NX prescriptions). The present analyses sought to identify differences in the weekly percentages of opioid-positive urine tests between participants treated with the two medications. The proportion of opioid-positive tests in both conditions was less than 20 % for 21 of the 22 weeks in the per-protocol sample and all 22 weeks in the completers sample. Generalized linear mixed model analyses revealed a significant treatment (XR-NTX vs. BUP-NX) X week (weeks 3-24) interaction in the per-protocol sample but not the completers sample. In the per-protocol analysis, the BUP-NX, compared to XR-NTX, had significantly greater proportions of opioid-positive tests in 14 out of the 22 weeks. Longitudinal modeling approaches that utilize flexible procedures for handling missing data can offer a different perspective on study findings. Results from the present analyses suggest that XR-NTX appeared to be somewhat more effective than BUP-NX in reducing illicit opioid use in the per-protocol sample.","Administration, Sublingual;Adult;Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Delayed-Action Preparations;Female;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Male;Medication Adherence;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Prescriptions;Procedures;Randomized Controlled Trial;Therapeutics;Urine",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.","Affect;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Comment;Community;Community Networks;Comorbidity;Coronavirus;Disease;Freedom;Humans;Incidence;Infections;Lead;Mental Health;Models, Psychological;Models, Theoretical;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Pandemics;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Public Policy;Research;Risk;Social Environment;Time",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a new collaborative care model involving buprenorphine-waivered physicians and community pharmacists. Nonrandomized, single-arm, open-label feasibility trial. Three office-based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) clinics and three community pharmacies in the United States. Six physicians, six pharmacists, and 71 patients aged ≥18 years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) OUD on buprenorphine maintenance. After screening, eligible patients' buprenorphine care was transferred from their OBBT physician to a community pharmacist for 6 months. Primary outcomes included recruitment, treatment retention and adherence, and opioid use. Secondary outcomes were intervention fidelity, pharmacists' use of prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), participant safety, and satisfaction with treatment delivery. A high proportion (93.4%, 71/76) of eligible participants enrolled into the study. There were high rates of treatment retention (88.7%) and adherence (95.3%) at the end of the study. The proportion of opioid-positive urine drug screens (UDSs) among complete cases (i.e. those with all six UDSs collected during 6 months) at month 6 was (4.9%, 3/61). Intervention fidelity was excellent. Pharmacists used PDMP at 96.8% of visits. There were no opioid-related safety events. Over 90% of patients endorsed that they were ""very satisfied with their experience and the quality of treatment offered,"" that ""treatment transfer from physician's office to the pharmacy was not difficult at all,"" and that ""holding buprenorphine visits at the same place the medication is dispensed was very or extremely useful/convenient.""

There is an urgency to accelerate SUD medication development. We present an integrated drug repurposing strategy that combines computational prediction, clinical corroboration using electronic health records (EHRs) of over 72.9 million patients and mechanisms of action analysis. Among top-ranked repurposed candidate drugs, tramadol, olanzapine, mirtazapine, bupropion, and atomoxetine were associated with increased odds of OUD remission (adjusted odds ratio: 1.51 [1.38-1.66], 1.90 [1.66-2.18], 1.38 [1.31-1.46], 1.37 [1.29-1.46], 1.48 [1.25-1.76], p value &lt; 0.001, respectively). Genetic and functional analyses showed these five candidate drugs directly target multiple OUD-associated genes including BDNF, CYP2D6, OPRD1, OPRK1, OPRM1, HTR1B, POMC, SLC6A4 and OUD-associated pathways, including opioid signaling, G-protein activation, serotonin receptors, and GPCR signaling. In summary, we developed an integrated drug repurposing approach and identified five repurposed candidate drugs that might be of value for treating OUD patients, including those suffering from comorbid conditions.","Analgesics, Opioid;Atomoxetine;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Bupropion;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Drug Development;Drug Repositioning;Electronic Health Records;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Genetics;Humans;Mirtazapine;Morbidity;Mortality;Odds Ratio;Olanzapine;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Public Health;Receptors, Serotonin;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins;Substance Use Disorders;Tramadol",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Mol Psychiatry,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We conducted this multisite, double-blind, two-stage, placebo-controlled trial with the use of a sequential parallel comparison design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release injectable naltrexone (380 mg every 3 weeks) plus oral extended-release bupropion (450 mg per day) in adults with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder. In the first stage of the trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 0.26:0.74 ratio to receive naltrexone-bupropion or matching injectable and oral placebo for 6 weeks. Those in the placebo group who did not have a response in stage 1 underwent rerandomization in stage 2 and were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive naltrexone-bupropion or placebo for an additional 6 weeks. Urine samples were obtained from participants twice weekly. The primary outcome was a response, defined as at least three methamphetamine-negative urine samples out of four samples obtained at the end of stage 1 or stage 2, and the weighted average of the responses in the two stages is reported. The treatment effect was defined as the between-group difference in the overall weighted responses. A total of 403 participants were enrolled in stage 1, and 225 in stage 2. In the first stage, 18 of 109 participants (16.5%) in the naltrexone-bupropion group and 10 of 294 (3.4%) in the placebo group had a response. In the second stage, 13 of 114 (11.4%) in the naltrexone-bupropion group and 2 of 111 (1.8%) in the placebo group had a response. The weighted average response across the two stages was 13.6% with naltrexone-bupropion and 2.5% with placebo, for an overall treatment effect of 11.1 percentage points (Wald z-test statistic, 4.53; P&lt;0.001). Adverse events with naltrexone-bupropion included gastrointestinal disorders, tremor, malaise, hyperhidrosis, and anorexia. Serious adverse events occurred in 8 of 223 participants (3.6%) who received naltrexone-bupropion during the trial. Among adults with methamphetamine use disorder, the response over a period of 12 weeks among participants who received extended-release injectable naltrexone plus oral extended-release bupropion was low but was higher than that among participants who received placebo.

A core outcome set (COS) is a minimum set of outcome measures that are recommended for all studies of a particular condition. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) Core Outcome Set for OUD (COS-OUD) is a development study to identify core constructs, meaningful outcomes, and their optimal measurement for all efficacy and effectiveness studies of OUD treatment and service delivery. Overseen by an expert workgroup, a modified, stepwise, e-Delphi methodology will be used to gain consensus among a panel of clinical practitioners and researchers involved in the treatment of OUD, who are members of the CTN. Sequential rounds of anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to identify, rate the importance of, and refine a core outcome set. A consensus threshold will be achieved if at least 70% of the panel rate the measure as critical for inclusion in the COS-OUD. Where consensus is not reached or there are suggestions for new measures, these will be brought forward to a further round of review prior to a consensus meeting. Products from this study will be communicated via peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences.

33608060,2021,Creation of an algorithm for clinical decision support for treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine in primary care.,"The treatment capacity for opioid use disorder (OUD) lags far behind the number of patients in need of treatment. Capacity is limited, in part, by the limited number of physicians who offer office based OUD treatment with buprenorphine. Measurement based care (MBC) has been proposed as a means to support primary care physicians in treating OUD. Here, we propose a set of measures and a clinical decision support algorithm to provide MBC for the treatment of OUD. We utilized literature search and expert consensus to identify measures for universal screening and symptom tracking. We used expert consensus to create the clinical decision support algorithm. The Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) tool was selected as the best published measure for universal screening in primary care. No published measure was identified as appropriate for symptom tracking or medication adherence; therefore, we created the OUD Symptom Checklist from the DSM-5 criteria for OUD and the Patient Adherence Questionnaire for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment (PAQ-OUD) to assess medication adherence. We developed and present a clinical decision support algorithm to provide direct guidance regarding treatment interventions during the first 12 weeks of buprenorphine treatment. Creation of these tools is the necessary first step for implementation of MBC for the treatment of OUD with buprenorphine in primary care. Further work is needed to test the feasibility and acceptability of these tools.

33610093,2021,Self-efficacy as a mediator of patient navigation interventions to engage persons living with HIV and substance use.,"People living with HIV who report substance use (PLWH-SU) face many barriers to care, resulting in an increased risk for poor health outcomes and the potential for ongoing disease transmission. This study evaluates the mechanisms by which Patient Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM) interventions may work to address barriers to care and improve HIV outcomes in this population. Mediation analysis was conducted using data from a randomized, multi-site trial testing PN interventions to improve HIV care outcomes among 801 hospitalized PLHW-SU. Direct and indirect effects of PN and PN + CM were evaluated through five potential mediators-psychosocial conditions, healthcare avoidance, financial hardship, system barriers, and self-efficacy for HIV treatment adherence-on engagement in HIV care and viral suppression. The PN + CM intervention had an indirect effect on improving engagement in HIV care at 6 months by increasing self-efficacy for HIV treatment adherence (β = 0.042, 95% CI = 0.008, 0.086). PN + CM also led to increases in viral suppression at 6 months (β = 0.090, 95% CI = 0.023, 0.168) and 12 months (β = 0.069, 95% CI = 0.009, 0.129) via increases in self-efficacy, although the direct effects were not significant. No mediating effects were observed for PN alone. PN + CM interventions for PLWH-SU can increase an individual's self-efficacy for HIV treatment adherence, which in turn improves engagement in care at 6 months and may contribute to viral suppression over 12 months. Building self-efficacy may be a key factor in the success of such interventions and should be considered as a primary goal of PN + CM in practice.",Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Adult;Behavior Therapy;Delivery of Health Care;Disease;Face;Female;Financial Stress;Goals;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;Health Care;Humans;Male;Mediating;Mediation Analysis;Middle Aged;Motivation;Patient Navigation;Persons;Population;Report;Risk;Self Efficacy;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Treatment Adherence;Work,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Three medications-methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release injectable naltrexone,- are efficacious for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). However, the utility of these medications is limited, in part due to poor rates of retention in treatment. In addition, minimum recovery milestones and other factors that influence when and whether individuals can safely discontinue medications are unknown. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study ""Optimizing Retention, Duration, and Discontinuation Strategies for Opioid Use Disorder Pharmacotherapy"" (RDD; CTN-0100) will be among the largest clinical trials on treatment of OUD yet conducted, consisting of two phases, the Retention phase, and the Duration-Discontinuation phase. The Retention phase, open to patients initiating treatment, will test different doses and formulations of buprenorphine (standard dose sublingual, high dose sublingual, or extended-release injection), and a digital therapeutic app delivering contingency management and cognitive behavioral counseling on the primary outcome of retention in treatment. The Discontinuation phase, open to patients in stable remission from OUD and choosing to discontinue medication (including participants from the Retention phase or from the population of patients treated at the clinical site, referred by an outside prescriber or self-referred) will study different tapering strategies for buprenorphine (sublingual taper vs taper with injection buprenorphine), and a digital therapeutic app which provides resources to promote recovery, on the primary outcome of relapse-free discontinuation of medication. This paper describes how the RDD trial derives from two decades of research in the CTN. Initial trials (CTN-0001; CTN-0002; CTN-0003) focused on opioid detoxification, showing buprenorphine-naloxone was effective for detoxification, but that acute detoxification did not appear to be an effective treatment strategy. Trials on comparative effectiveness of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (CTN-0027; CTN-0030; and CTN-0051) highlighted the problem of dropout from treatment and few trials defined retention on MOUD as the primary outcome. Long-term follow-up studies on those patient samples demonstrated the importance of long-term continuation of medication for many patients to sustain remission. Overall, these trials highlight the potential of a stable research infrastructure such as CTN to advance treatment effectiveness through a programmatic succession of large clinical trials.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Effectiveness;Clinical Trial;Counseling;Drug Abuse;Drug Therapy;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Injectables;Injections;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Nitrosamines;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Paper;Patients;Population;Relapse;Research;Resources;Self;Standards;Therapeutics;United States",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33731210,2021,External validation of an opioid misuse machine learning classifier in hospitalized adult patients.,"Opioid misuse screening in hospitals is resource-intensive and rarely done. Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse. An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort. Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.64). Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation. Our model may provide a comprehensive and automated approach to opioid misuse identification that augments current workflows and overcomes manual screening barriers.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Area Under Curve;Calibration;Electronic Health Records;Heroin;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Institutes;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Phenotype;Positive Predictive Value;Prevalence;Program;Reference Standards;Resources;Screening;Sensitivity;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Workflow",Drug Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33737199,2021,The design and conduct of a randomized clinical trial comparing emergency department initiation of sublingual versus a 7-day extended-release injection formulation of buprenorphine for opioid use disorder: Project ED Innovation.,"ED-INNOVATION (Emergency Department-INitiated bupreNOrphine VAlidaTION) is a Hybrid Type-1 Implementation-Effectiveness multisite emergency department (ED) study funded through The Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM efforts to increase access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). We use components of Implementation Facilitation to enhance adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine (BUP) at approximately 30 sites. Subsequently we compare the effectiveness of two BUP formulations, sublingual (SL-BUP) and 7-day extended-release injectable (CAM2038, XR-BUP) in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of approximately 2000 patients with OUD on the primary outcome of engagement in formal addiction treatment at 7 days. Secondary outcomes assessed at 7 and 30 days include self-reported opioid use, craving and satisfaction, health service utilization, overdose events, and engagement in formal addiction treatment (30 days) and receipt of medications for OUD (at 7 and 30 days). A sample size of 1000 per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided significance level to detect a difference in the primary outcome of 8% and accommodates a 15% dropout rate. We will compare the cost effectiveness of the two treatments on the primary outcome using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We will also conduct an ancillary study in approximately 75 patients experiencing minimal to no opioid withdrawal who will undergo XR-BUP initiation. If the ancillary study demonstrates safety, we will expand the eligibility criteria for the RCT to include individuals with minimal to no opioid withdrawal. The results of these studies will inform implementation of ED-initiated BUP in diverse EDs which has the potential to improve treatment access.","Access To Medicines;Adoption;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Cost Effectiveness;Craving;Delayed-Action Preparations;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health Services;Humans;Hybrids;Implementation Science;Injectables;Injections;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Power, Psychological;Safety;Sample Size;Satisfaction;Self;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Contemp Clin Trials,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33766009,2021,Predictive model of multiple emergency department visits among adults: analysis of the data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).,"In this methodological paper, we use a novel, predictive approach to examine how demographics, substance use, mental and other health indicators predict multiple visits (≥3) to emergency departments (ED) within a year. State-of-the-art predictive methods were used to evaluate predictive ability and factors predicting multiple visits to ED within a year and to identify factors that influenced the strength of the prediction. The analysis used public-use datasets from the 2015-2018 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which used the same questionnaire on the variables of interest. Analysis focused on adults aged ≥18 years. Several predictive models (regressions, trees, and random forests) were validated and compared on independent datasets. Predictive ability on a test set for multiple ED visits (≥3 times within a year) measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) reached 0.8, which is good for a national survey. Models revealed consistency in predictive factors across the 4 survey years. The most influential variables for predicting ≥3 ED visits per year were fair/poor self-rated health, being nervous or restless/fidgety, having a lower income, asthma, heart condition/disease, having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), nicotine dependence, African-American race, female sex, having diabetes, and being of younger age (18-20). The findings reveal the need to address behavioral and mental health contributors to ED visits and reinforce the importance of developing integrated care models in primary care settings to improve mental health for medically vulnerable patients. The presented modeling approach can be broadly applied to national and other large surveys.","Ability;Address;Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Aged;Art;Asthma;Dataset;Demography;Disease;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Forests;Health;Heart;Humans;Income;Indicators;Influentials;Mental Health;Methods;Needs;Nicotine Dependence;Paper;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Primary Health Care;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive;Questionnaires;Racial Stocks;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Self;Sex;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Time;Trees","Asthma;Nicotine Dependence;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders",BMC Health Serv Res,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33771287,2021,Association between methadone or buprenorphine use during medically supervised opioid withdrawal and extended-release injectable naltrexone induction failure.,"Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is an effective maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder, but induction from active opioid use is a challenge as individuals must complete detoxification before induction. We aimed to determine whether use of methadone or buprenorphine, long acting agonist opioids commonly used for detoxification, were associated with decreased likelihood of induction onto XR-NTX. We performed a secondary analysis of a large open-label randomized trial of buprenorphine versus XR-NTX for treatment of individuals with opioid use disorder recruited from eight short term residential (detoxification) units. This analysis only included individuals randomized to the XR-NTX arm of the trial (N = 283). The method of detoxification varied according to usual practices at each inpatient program. Logistic regression models estimating the log-odds of induction onto XR-NTX were fit, with detoxification regimen received as the predictor. In the unadjusted logistic regression model, detoxification drug received (either methadone or buprenorphine) was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of induction onto XR-NTX compared to receiving non-opioid detoxification (Overall: P &lt; 0.001); buprenorphine vs non-opioid detoxification: OR (95% CI) = 0.32 (0.15-0.67); methadone vs non-opioid detoxification: OR (95% CI) = 0.23 (0.11-0.46). After controlling for site as a random effect, the association of detoxification drug with induction success lost statistical significance. Use of agonist medication during detoxification was associated with XR-NTX induction failure. Medication choice was determined by each site's clinical practice and therefore this association could not be separated from other site level variables.

33773868,2021,Voting with their feet: Social factors linked with treatment for opioid use disorder using same-day buprenorphine delivered in California hospitals.,"Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) using buprenorphine in primary or specialty care settings is accessed primarily by persons with private health insurance, stable housing, and no polysubstance use. This paper applies Social Cognitive Theory to frame links between social factors and treatment outcomes among patients with social and economic disadvantages who are seeking MOUD at California Bridge Program (CA Bridge) hospitals. Electronic medical records for patients identified with OUD between January-April, 2020 receiving care at CA Bridge hospitals defined outcomes: hospital-administered buprenorphine; provision of buprenorphine prescription at discharge. Multi-level models assessed whether social factors-housing status, insurance type, and co-methamphetamine use-predicted outcomes while accounting for group-level effects of treating hospital and controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and gender. 15 CA Bridge hospitals yielded 845 patient records. Most patients received hospital-administered buprenorphine (58 %) and/or a buprenorphine prescription (55 %); 26 % received neither treatment. Patients with unstable housing had greater odds of hospital-administered buprenorphine compared to patients with stable housing. Patients with Medicaid had greater odds of receiving a buprenorphine prescription compared to patients with other insurance. Co-methamphetamine use was not associated with outcomes. Patients with OUD are successful in accessing same-day MOUD in CA Bridge hospital settings over a significant period. Importantly, access to MOUD in these settings was facilitated for patients traditionally not treated using buprenorphine, i.e., those with housing instability, Medicaid insurance, and co-methamphetamine use. Findings suggest barriers to MOUD for patients with social and economic disadvantages can be lowered by changing treatment delivery.","Accounting;Administration;Buprenorphine;California;Economics;Electronic Health Records;Emergencies;Ethnic Groups;Foot;Gender;Hospitals;Housing;Humans;Insurance;Insurance Coverage;Insurance, Health;Medicaid;Methamphetamine;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paper;Patients;Persons;Prescriptions;Program;Racial Stocks;Records;Social Cognitive Theory;Social Factors;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States;Voting",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The aim of this study was to examine the extent and correlates of problematic substance use by substance-specific risk categories among primary care patients to inform screening/intervention efforts. Methods: Data were analyzed from 2000 adult primary care patients aged ≥18 years (56% female) across 5 clinics in the eastern U.S. Participants completed the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Prevalence and ASSIST-defined risk-level of tobacco use, alcohol use, and nonmedical/illicit drug use was examined. Multinomial logistic regression models analyzed the demographic correlates of substance use risk-levels. Results: Among the total sample, the prevalence of any past 3-month use was 53.9% for alcohol, 42.0% for tobacco, 24.2% for any illicit/Rx drug, and 5.3% for opioids; the prevalence of ASSIST-defined moderate/high-risk use was 45.1% for tobacco, 29.0% for any illicit/Rx drug, 14.2% for alcohol, and 9.1% for opioids. Differences in the extent and risk-levels of substance use by sex, race/ethnicity, and age group were observed. Adjusted logistic regression showed that male sex, white race, not being married, and having less education were associated with increased odds of moderate/high-risk use scores for each substance category; older ages (versus ages 18-25 years) were associated with increased odds of moderate/high-risk opioid use. Conclusions: Intervention need for problematic substance use was prevalent in this sample. Providers should maintain awareness and screen for problematic substance use more consistently in identified high risk populations.",Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohols;Awareness;Demography;Education;Ethnic Groups;Female;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Logistic Regression;Male;Methods;Needs;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Risk;Screening;Sex;Smoking;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Whites;Young Adult,Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

33823972,2021,Comorbid Substance Use Disorder Profiles and Receipt of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Services: A National Study.,"Those with comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) are a particularly vulnerable group. Information regarding the nature of these comorbidities and how they relate to receipt of substance use treatment could reduce the treatment gap that exists among those with comorbid SUDs. Public-use data from the 2015-2017 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health was used to analyze past-year SUD comorbidity combinations among 12 substances and the relationship between these combinations with past-year treatment in adults (N = 128,740). In all, 7.9% of adults had at least one SUD in the past year (6.7% had one SUD, 0.9% had two SUDs, and 0.3% had three or more). Conditioning on specific SUDs, the prevalence of having additional SUDs ranged from 14.9% (alcohol) to 85.1% (hallucinogens). The four most common SUD combinations all included alcohol use disorder. Alcohol and marijuana use disorder was the most common comorbidity combination and had the lowest receipt of treatment. Compared to those with one SUD, adjusted odds of receiving treatment were almost two times greater for those with two SUDs, and more than four times greater for those with three or more SUDs. Treatment prevalence was lower for those who had higher family income and education, were not employed full time, were married, were younger than age 26 years or older than age 50 years, and were Asian. Even though the treatment gap is reduced among those with multiple SUDs, it remains large.

33838307,2021,Design and methods of a multi-site randomized controlled trial of an integrated care model of long-acting injectable buprenorphine with infectious disease treatment among persons hospitalized with infections and opioid use disorder.,"Hospitalization with co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD) and infections presents a critical time to intervene to improve outcomes for these intertwined epidemics that are typically managed separately. A surge in life-threatening infectious diseases associated with injection drug use, including bacterial and fungal infections, HIV, and HCV accounts for substantial healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Infectious Disease (ID) specialists manage severe infections that require hospitalization and are a logical resource to engage patients in medication treatment for OUD (MOUD). An injectable long-acting monthly formulation of buprenorphine (LAB) has a potential advantage for initiating MOUD within hospital settings and bridging to treatment after discharge. A randomized multi-site trial tests a new model of care (ID/LAB) in which OUD and infections are managed by ID specialists and hospitalists using LAB coupled with referrals to community resources for long-term MOUD. A sample of 200 adults admitted to three U.S. hospitals for OUD and infections are randomly assigned 1:1 to ID/LAB or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients enrolled in effective MOUD at 12 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes include relapse to opioid use, adherence to infectious disease treatment, infection morbidity and mortality, and drug overdose. We describe the design, procedures, statistical analysis, and early implementation issues of this randomized trial. Study findings will provide insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of integrated treatment of OUD and serious infections and have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.","Adult;Buprenorphine;Communicable Diseases;Community;Delivery of Health Care, Integrated;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;HIV;Health Care;Hospitalists;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Id;Infections;Injectables;Injections;Life;Methods;Morbidity;Mortality;Mycoses;Neoplasm Recurrence, Local;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Random Allocation;Randomized Controlled Trial;Referral;Relapse;Resources;Specialists;Therapeutics;Time;Vulnerable Populations","Communicable Diseases;Drug Overdose;Infections;Mycoses;Neoplasm Recurrence, Local;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse",Contemp Clin Trials,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33879260,2021,Is telemedicine the answer to rural expansion of medication treatment for opioid use disorder? Early experiences in the feasibility study phase of a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network Trial.,"Telemedicine (TM) enabled by digital health technologies to provide medical services has been considered a key solution to increasing health care access in rural communities. With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","Address;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Clinical Trial;Comment;Community;Comprehension;Devices;Digital Technology;Drug Abuse;Feasibility Studies;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Internet Access;Knowledge;Needs;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Persons;Pilots;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Primary Health Care;Procedures;Public Health;Randomized Controlled Trial;Referral;Research;Risk;Rural Communities;Rural Population;Scales;Screening;Solutions;Technology, Health Care;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Workflow",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33950535,2021,Cost-effectiveness implications of increasing the efficiency of the extended-release naltrexone induction process for the treatment of opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis.,"In a US randomized-effectiveness trial comparing extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) with buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) for the prevention of opioid relapse among participants recruited during inpatient detoxification (CTN-0051), the requirement to complete opioid detoxification prior to initiating XR-NTX resulted in lower rates of initiation of XR-NTX (72% XR-NTX versus 94% BUP-NX). This was a retrospective secondary analysis of CTN-0051 trial data, including follow-up data over 24-36 weeks. Eight community-based, inpatient-detoxification and follow-up outpatient treatment facilities in the United States. A total of 283 participants randomized to receive XR-NTX. Efficiency was estimated using a multivariable generalized structural equation model to explore simultaneous determinants of XR-NTX induction and induction duration (detoxification + residential days). Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the health-care sector perspective and included expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Treatment site was the only modifiable factor that simultaneously increased the likelihood of XR-NTX induction and decreased induction duration. Incorporating the higher predicted probability of XR-NTX induction, and fewer predicted days of detoxification and subsequent residential treatment into the cost-effectiveness framework, reduced the incremental average 24-week total cost of XR-NTX treatment from $5317 more than that of BUP-NX (P = 0.01) to a non-statistically-significant difference of $1016 (P = 0.63). QALYs gained remained similar across arms. Adopting an efficient model of extended-release naltrexone initiation could result in extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine-naloxone being of comparable economic value from the health-care sector perspective over 24-36 weeks for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder at an inpatient detoxification facility.","Arm;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Community;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Delayed-Action Preparations;Economics;Efficiency;Health Care Sector;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Probability;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Relapse;Residential Treatment;Retrospective Studies;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Participants of 2 randomized controlled trials (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care [EMBARC; n = 251 with DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder; study duration: August 2011-December 2015] and STimulant Reduction Intervention Using Dosed Exercise [STRIDE; n = 302 with DSM-IV diagnosis of stimulant abuse or dependence; study-duration: July 2010-February 2013]) and treatment-seeking patients in primary care clinics from an ongoing quality-improvement project (VitalSign6; n = 4,370; project duration: August 2014-July 2019) were included. Psychometric properties of the P-FIBS were evaluated with confirmatory factor and item response theory analyses in EMBARC and VitalSign6. The approach of Baron and Kenny was used to assess whether irritability accounted for the effect of pain on depression. Cronbach α (0.84-0.89) and model fits for single-factor structure of P-FIBS were acceptable. Pain was positively correlated with irritability (r = 0.22-0.29) and depression (r = 0.10-0.33). Irritability accounted for 40.7%-65.5% of the effect of pain on depression. Higher irritability and depression were associated with poorer social functioning, quality of life, and productivity in work- and non-work-related activities. Pain was associated with non-work-related activity impairments even after controlling for irritability and depression. The P-FIBS is a brief and reliable measure of pain. Irritability is associated with pain and accounts for a large proportion of the effect of pain on depression.

34014326,2021,Comparison of Methods for Alcohol and Drug Screening in Primary Care Clinics.,"Guidelines recommend that adult patients receive screening for alcohol and drug use during primary care visits, but the adoption of screening in routine practice remains low. Clinics frequently struggle to choose a screening approach that is best suited to their resources, workflows, and patient populations. To evaluate how to best implement electronic health record (EHR)-integrated screening for substance use by comparing commonly used screening methods and examining their association with implementation outcomes. This article presents the outcomes of phases 3 and 4 of a 4-phase quality improvement, implementation feasibility study in which researchers worked with stakeholders at 6 primary care clinics in 2 large urban academic health care systems to define and implement their optimal screening approach. Site A was located in New York City and comprised 2 clinics, and site B was located in Boston, Massachusetts, and comprised 4 clinics. Clinics initiated screening between January 2017 and October 2018, and 93 114 patients were eligible for screening for alcohol and drug use. Data used in the analysis were collected between January 2017 and October 2019, and analysis was performed from July 13, 2018, to March 23, 2021. Clinics integrated validated screening questions and a brief counseling script into the EHR, with implementation supported by the use of clinical champions (ie, clinicians who advocate for change, motivate others, and use their expertise to facilitate the adoption of an intervention) and the training of clinic staff. Clinics varied in their screening approaches, including the type of visit targeted for screening (any visit vs annual examinations only), the mode of administration (staff-administered vs self-administered by the patient), and the extent to which they used practice facilitation and EHR usability testing. Data from the EHRs were extracted quarterly for 12 months to measure implementation outcomes. The primary outcome was screening rate for alcohol and drug use. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol and drug use detected via screening, and clinician adoption of a brief counseling script. Patients of the 6 clinics had a mean (SD) age ranging from 48.9 (17.3) years at clinic B2 to 59.1 (16.7) years at clinic B3, were predominantly female (52.4% at clinic A1 to 64.6% at clinic A2), and were English speaking. Racial diversity varied by location. Of the 93,114 patients with primary care visits, 71.8% received screening for alcohol use, and 70.5% received screening for drug use. Screening at any visit (implemented at site A) in comparison with screening at annual examinations only (implemented at site B) was associated with higher screening rates for alcohol use (90.3%-94.7% vs 24.2%-72.0%, respectively) and drug use (89.6%-93.9% vs 24.6%-69.8%). The 5 clinics that used a self-administered screening approach had a higher detection rate for moderate- to high-risk alcohol use (14.7%-36.6%) compared with the 1 clinic that used a staff-administered screening approach (1.6%). The detection of moderate- to high-risk drug use was low across all clinics (0.5%-1.0%). Clinics with more robust practice facilitation and EHR usability testing had somewhat greater adoption of the counseling script for patients with moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use (1.4%-12.5% vs 0.1%-1.1%). In this quality improvement study, EHR-integrated screening was feasible to implement in all clinics and unhealthy alcohol use was detected more frequently when self-administered screening was used at any primary care visit. The detection of drug use was low at all clinics, as was clinician adoption of counseling. These findings can be used to inform the decision-making of health care systems that are seeking to implement screening for substance use.

34075644,2021,Examination of Correlates of OUD Outcomes in Young Adults: Secondary Analysis From the XBOT Trial.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment outcomes are poorer for young adults than older adults. Developmental differences are broadly implicated, but particular vulnerability factor interactions are poorly understood. This study sought to identify moderators of OUD relapse between age groups. This secondary analysis compared young adults (18-25) to older adults (26+) from a comparative effectiveness trial (""XBOT"") that randomized (N = 570) participants to extended-release naltrexone or sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone. We explored the relationship between 25 prespecified patient baseline characteristics and relapse to regular opioid use by age group and treatment condition, using logistic regression. Young adults (n = 111) had higher rates of 24-week relapse than older adults (n = 459) (70.3% vs 58.8%) and differed on a number of specific characteristics, including more smokers, more intravenous opioid use, and more cannabis use. No significant moderators predicted relapse, in either three-way or two-way interactions. No baseline factors were identified as moderating the relationship between age group and opioid relapse, nor any interactions between baseline characteristics, age group, and treatment condition to predict opioid relapse. Poorer treatment outcomes for young adults are likely associated with multiple developmental vulnerabilities rather than any single predominant factor. Although not reaching significance, several characteristics (using heroin, smoking tobacco, high levels of depression/anxiety, or treatment because of family/friends) showed higher odds ratio point estimates for relapse in young adults than older adults. This is the first study to explore moderators of worse OUD treatment outcomes in young adults, highlighting the need to identify predictor variables that could inform treatment enhancements.

34098301,2021,"Naturalistic follow-up after a trial of medications for opioid use disorder: Medication status, opioid use, and relapse.","This report examined naturalistic opioid use outcomes and utilization of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) 36 weeks post-randomization in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) Extended-Release Naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus Buprenorphine-Naloxone (BUP-NX) for Opioid Treatment trial (CTN-0051, X:BOT). X:BOT was a multisite, randomized, 24-week comparative effectiveness trial of BUP-NX (N = 287) and XR-NTX (N = 283). Study medications were discontinued following treatment completion, relapse, or dropout. Participants were encouraged to continue MOUD. This report examined opioid use outcomes in 428 (75%) of the 570 participants who attended the 36-week follow-up visit. Adults with opioid use disorder recruited from 8 community treatment programs across the United States. Outcomes included medication status (on/off MOUD), type of MOUD (BUP-NX, XR-NTX, or methadone), abstinence from non-prescribed opioids, opioid use days, relapse, and other substance use 30 days prior to the 36-week visit. Relapse was defined as opioid use for 4 consecutive weeks or 7 consecutive days in the past month. Baseline and clinical variables included opioid use severity, intravenous drug use, study medication assignment, and induction status. Of the 428 participants who completed the 36-week visit, 225 (53%) of participants were receiving MOUD and 203 (47%) were not. Compared to those off medication, participants on medication had fewer opioid use days (4.4 days (SD 9.0) versus 9.8 days (SD 12.1)), fewer met relapse criteria (37 (16.4%) versus 79 (38.9%)), and reported less stimulant use (34 (15.2%) versus 56 (27.7%)) and sedative use (14 (6.3%) versus 31 (15.3%)). There was no difference in abstinence rates between those on or off MOUD. A greater proportion of participants on XR-NTX (47 (53.4%) of 88 participants) were abstinent from non-prescribed opioids compared to those on buprenorphine (28 (23.3%) of 120 participants). Naturalistic outcomes data showed that despite potential barriers to continuing treatment in the community, about half of individuals were on opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy at follow-up and those on medication generally had better outcomes. Future research should explore barriers and facilitators to treatment retention in community settings; and developing interventions tailored to improve treatment engagement and adherence.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Community;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Abuse;Drug Therapy;Follow-Up Studies;Future;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Random Allocation;Recurrence;Relapse;Report;Research;Sedatives;Substance Use;Therapeutics;United States",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Use,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34105213,2022,Long-term follow-up assessment of opioid use outcomes among individuals with comorbid mental disorders and opioid use disorder treated with buprenorphine or methadone in a randomized clinical trial.,"To investigate whether reduction in opioid use differs when treated by either buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP) or methadone (MET) among adults with comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD) and mental disorders. In a randomized controlled trial, adults with OUD were randomized to 24 weeks of either BUP or MET treatment and were followed up in 3-yearly assessments. The present secondary analyses were based on 597 participants who completed all assessments. The outcome measure was the number of days of using opioids per month during the follow-up period. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to classify participants into three groups: life-time mood disorder (n = 302), life-time mental disorder other than mood disorder (n = 114) and no mental disorder (n = 181). Medication treatment (BUP, MET, no treatment) during the follow-up period was a time-varying predictor. Based on zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) mixed regression analysis, it was found that relative to no treatment, opioid use during the follow-up was significantly reduced by BUP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07-0.21 for any use; risk ratio (RR) = 0.77, 95% CI =0.66-0.89 for days of use] and by MET [OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.25-0.45 for any use; RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84 for days of use]. Relative to MET, BUP was associated with a lower likelihood of any opioid use among participants with mood disorders (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74) and for participants without mental disorder (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.21-0.66) and fewer number of days using opioids (RR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.25-0.56) among participants with other mental disorders. Among adults with comorbid opioid use disorder and mental disorders, treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone produced greater reductions in opioid use than treatment with methadone.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Life;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Methadone;Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview;Mood Disorders;Narcotic Antagonists;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Randomized Controlled Trial;Regression Analysis;Relatives;Therapeutics;Time",Mental Disorders;Mood Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34118716,2021,"Reductions in tobacco use in naltrexone, relative to buprenorphine-maintained individuals with opioid use disorder: Secondary analysis from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network.","Smoking prevalence in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) is over 80%. Research suggests that opioid use significantly increases smoking, which could account for the strikingly low smoking-cessation rates observed in both methadone- and buprenorphine-maintained patients, even with the use of first-line smoking-cessation interventions. If opioids present a barrier to smoking-cessation, then better smoking outcomes should be observed in OUD patients treated with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, an opioid antagonist) compared to those receiving buprenorphine (BUP-NX, a partial opioid agonist). The current study is a secondary analysis of a 24-week, multi-site, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network comparing the effectiveness of XR-NTX vs. BUP-NX for adults with OUD. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used to determine if there was a significant reduction in cigarette use among daily smokers successfully inducted to treatment (n = 373) and a subset of those who completed treatment (n = 169). Among daily smokers inducted onto OUD medication, those in the XR-NTX group smoked fewer cigarettes per day (M = 11.36, SE = 0.62) relative to smokers in the BUP-NX group (M = 13.33, SE = 0.58) across all study visits, (b (SE) = -1.97 (0.55), p &lt; .01). Results were similar for the treatment completers. OUD patients treated with XR-NTX reduced cigarette use more than those treated with BUP-NX, suggesting that XR-NTX in combination with other smoking cessation interventions might be a better choice for OUD smokers interested in reducing their tobacco use.","Adult;Buprenorphine;Cigarettes;Clinical Trial;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Abuse;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Partial Opioid Agonists;Patients;Prevalence;Relatives;Research;Smokers;Smoking;Smoking Cessation;Therapeutics;Tobacco Use",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34130758,2021,A pilot study of the functionality and clinician acceptance of a clinical decision support tool to improve primary care of opioid use disorder.,"Most Americans with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not receive indicated medical care. A clinical decision support (CDS) tool for primary care providers (PCPs) could address this treatment gap. Our primary objective was to build OUD-CDS tool and demonstrate its functionality and accuracy. Secondary objectives were to achieve high use and approval rates and improve PCP confidence in diagnosing and treating OUD. A convenience sample of 55 PCPs participated. Buprenorphine-waivered PCPs (n = 8) were assigned to the intervention. Non-waivered PCPs (n = 47) were randomized to intervention (n = 24) or control (n = 23). Intervention PCPs received access to the OUD-CDS, which alerted them to patients at potentially increased risk for OUD or overdose and guided diagnosis and treatment. Control PCPs provided care as usual. The OUD-CDS was functional and accurate following extensive multi-phased testing. PCPs used the OUD-CDS in 5% of encounters with at-risk patients, far less than the goal of 60%. OUD screening confidence increased for all intervention PCPs and OUD diagnosis increased for non-waivered intervention PCPs. Most PCPs (65%) would recommend the OUD-CDS and found it helpful with screening for OUD and discussing and prescribing OUD medications. PCPs generally liked the OUD-CDS, but use rates were low, suggesting the need to modify CDS design, implementation strategies and integration with existing primary care workflows. The OUD-CDS tool was functional and accurate, but PCP use rates were low. Despite low use, the OUD-CDS improved confidence in OUD screening, diagnosis and use of buprenorphine.

34134863,2021,"Reduction in injection risk behaviors after implementation of a syringe services program, Miami, Florida.","Syringe services programs (SSPs) are evidence-based HIV prevention programs for people who inject drugs. However, not all SSPs operate evidence-based syringe distribution models, such as needs-based distribution. This study aims to provide preliminary evidence from the IDEA SSP on changes in injection risk behaviors over time, and to examine factors, including syringe coverage, associated with injection risk behavior trajectories over time under a one-for-one syringe distribution model. We used a prospective observational study design to generate a cohort of SSP clients who completed three behavioral assessments at SSP service visits between December 2016 and January 2020 (N = 115). The study used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the relationship between covariate measures and the primary outcomes. The primary outcomes were 1) sharing of any injection equipment (e.g. syringes, needles, cookers, cottons) in the previous 30 days (yes/no) and 2) reusing of needles/syringes in the previous 30 days (yes/no). Men were more likely to report reusing syringes (aRR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.37) and those who reported injecting in public were less likely to report reusing syringes (aRR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99). HCV-positive clients had a 62% reduction in sharing injection equipment and those who reported public injection had a 62% increase in sharing injection equipment over time. Most importantly, increasing syringe coverage was associated with a decrease in both sharing injection equipment (aRR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.25-0.72) and reusing syringes (aRR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.95). This study provides preliminary evidence of reductions in injection-related risk behaviors from the IDEA SSP and highlights potential high priority groups, such as people experiencing homelessness, that may need additional intervention. In addition, improving syringe coverage among SSP clients may be an important factor in reducing behaviors that place individuals at risk for contracting HIV and HCV.","Behavior;Clients;Equipment;Female;Florida;HIV;HIV Infections;Homelessness;Humans;Injections;Male;Measures;Men;Needle Sharing;Needle-Exchange Programs;Needles;Needs;Observational Study;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Report;Risk;Risk Behavior;Risk-Taking;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Syringes;Time","HIV Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

This program evaluation examined predictors of ED-based OUD treatment and subsequent engagement. Program evaluation in Boston, MA. Adult patients who met criteria for OUD during an ED visit in 2019 were included. Patients were included if a diagnosis of OUD or opioid-related overdose was associated with the ED visit or if they met previously validated criteria for OUD within the previous 12 months. We assessed predictors of ED-OUD treatment receipt and subsequent engagement, using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set definition of initial encounter within 14 days of discharge and either 2 subsequent encounters or a subsequent buprenorphine prescription within 34 days of the initial encounter. We used generalized estimating equations for panel data. During 2019, 1946 patients met criteria for OUD. Referrals to Bridge Clinic were made for 207 (11%), buprenorphine initiated for 106 (5%), and home induction buprenorphine kits given to 56 (3%). Following ED discharge, 237 patients (12%) had a visit within 14 days, 122 (6%) had ≥2 additional visits, and 207 (11%) received a subsequent buprenorphine prescription. Young, White, male patients were most likely to receive ED-OUD care. Patients who received ED-OUD care were more likely to have subsequent treatment engagement (adjusted rate ratio: 2.30, 95% confidence intervals: 1.62-3.27).

The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other. In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N=287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N=283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing. In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI=0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio=2.15, 95% CI=1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio=0.32, 95% CI=0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal). Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.","Administration, Sublingual;Adult;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Criminal Justice;Delayed-Action Preparations;Demography;Female;Homelessness;Humans;Injections;Injections, Intramuscular;Inpatients;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Random Allocation;Relapse;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Relapse,Am J Psychiatry,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34176686,2021,Retention in Treatment after Emergency Department-Initiated Buprenorphine.,"Emergency department-initiated buprenorphine (EDIB) has been shown to be effective in connecting patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) to outpatient treatment. Five diverse emergency departments (EDs) have successfully implemented EDIB programs. 1) To measure attendance at the first referral appointment and 30-day retention in treatment rates for patients receiving EDIB; 2) To describe demographic and opioid use characteristics of patients receiving EDIB; and 3) To determine average length of time in treatment after EDIB at the five participating EDs. All patients receiving EDIB at the participating EDs (n = 522) were seen by a peer recovery specialist in the ED and demographic and opioid use characteristics were recorded. Patients were followed prospectively. The referral site was contacted and information regarding attendance at the first referral appointment and 30-day retention in treatment was obtained. All patients still in treatment at 30 days were continually followed at subsequent 30-day intervals until the referral site indicated the patient had ended treatment at their facility. The rate of attendance at the first referral appointment was 77.0% for patients receiving EDIB. At 30-day follow-up, 43.1% of patients were retained in treatment. The mean age of patient enrollment was 36.7 years, 58% of enrollees were male, 90.5% were white, and 73.4% had no medical insurance. Seventy-seven percent reported no substance use other than opioids. The mean time in treatment was 158 days. EDIB programs across diverse ED settings are effective at promoting attendance at the first referral appointment for OUD treatment; however, additional work is warranted to increase 30-day treatment retention rates, particularly among patients with nonprescription-only use profiles.","Adult;Appointments;Buprenorphine;Demography;Emergency Service, Hospital;Humans;Insurance;Male;Measures;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Program;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Specialists;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time;Whites;Work",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Emerg Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34183213,2022,The impact of COVID-19 on substance use disorder treatment in California: Service providers' perspectives.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the U.S. health care system, including addiction treatment. The objective of this study is to describe the impact of COVID on the delivery of treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) from the perspectives of service providers. Between May and September 2020, 61 service providers from 16 SUD treatment sites in California participated in virtual focus groups that lasted about an hour. We recorded the discussions and transcribed them verbatim. Two qualitative analysts independently conducted content analysis to identify themes from the transcripts. At the beginning of the pandemic, service providers observed a slight decrease in patient admissions, followed by an uptick in patient flow due to increased mental health issues, alcohol use, and relapse. Many of the clinics adopted flexible service delivery modes, such as curbside dosing and extended take-home medication, to enable social distancing in clinic settings. Approximately half of the clinic encounters offered telemedicime, and a considerable proportion of patients preferred to use telephone-based services rather than video-based services. Internet instability and technical difficulties limited the use of telemedicine among their patients. COVID has been challenging for SUD treatment, but health care systems rapidly reacted with adjustments that may result in long-term changes in SUD service delivery. Telemedicine-based services have played a major role in ensuring uninterrupted patient care. Providers need organizational, technical, and logistical support to improve and sustain telemedicine services that increase access to quality care for their patients.",Adjustment;Alcohols;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;California;Focus Groups;Health Care Systems;Humans;Internet;Mental Health;Needs;Pandemics;Patient Admission;Patient Care;Patients;Physical Distancing;Qualitative Research;Relapse;Role;SARS-CoV-2;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Telemedicine;Telephone;Therapeutics,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Relapse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34233750,2021,Receipt of medications for opioid use disorder among youth engaged in primary care: data from 6 health systems.,"Little is known about prevalence and treatment of OUD among youth engaged in primary care (PC). Medications are the recommended treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) for adolescents and young adults (youth). This study describes the prevalence of OUD, the prevalence of medication treatment for OUD, and patient characteristics associated with OUD treatment among youth engaged in PC. This cross-sectional study includes youth aged 16-25 years engaged in PC. Eligible patients had ≥ 1 PC visit during fiscal years (FY) 2014-2016 in one of 6 health systems across 6 states. Data from electronic health records and insurance claims were used to identify OUD diagnoses, office-based OUD medication treatment, and patient demographic and clinical characteristics in the FY of the first PC visit during the study period. Descriptive analyses were conducted in all youth, and stratified by age (16-17, 18-21, 22-25 years). Among 303,262 eligible youth, 2131 (0.7%) had a documented OUD diagnosis. The prevalence of OUD increased by ascending age groups. About half of youth with OUD had documented depression or anxiety and one third had co-occurring substance use disorders. Receipt of medication for OUD was lowest among youth 16-17 years old (14%) and highest among those aged 22-25 (39%). In this study of youth engaged in 6 health systems across 6 states, there was low receipt of medication treatment, and high prevalence of other substance use disorders and mental health disorders. These findings indicate an urgent need to increase medication treatment for OUD and to integrate treatment for other substance use and mental health disorders.","Adolescent;Age Groups;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Buprenorphine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Demography;Depression;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Health;Humans;Insurance;Mental Health;Naltrexone;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34264326,2021,High-Dose Buprenorphine Induction in the Emergency Department for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.,"Emergency departments (EDs) sporadically use a high-dose buprenorphine induction strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in response to the increasing potency of the illicit opioid drug supply and commonly encountered delays in access to follow-up care. To examine the safety and tolerability of high-dose (&gt;12 mg) buprenorphine induction for patients with OUD presenting to an ED. In this case series of ED encounters, data were manually abstracted from electronic health records for all ED patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine at a single, urban, safety-net hospital in Oakland, California, for the calendar year 2018. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to March 2021. ED physicians and advanced practice practitioners were trained on a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine induction protocol, which was then clinically implemented. Vital signs; use of supplemental oxygen; the presence of precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression; adverse events; length of stay; and hospitalization during and 24 hours after the ED visit were reported according to total sublingual buprenorphine dose (range, 2 to &gt;28 mg). Among a total of 391 unique patients (median [interquartile range] age, 36 [29-48] years), representing 579 encounters, 267 (68.3%) were male and 170 were (43.5%) Black. Homelessness (88 patients [22.5%]) and psychiatric disorders (161 patients [41.2%]) were common. A high dose of sublingual buprenorphine (&gt;12 mg) was administered by 54 unique clinicians during 366 (63.2%) encounters, including 138 doses (23.8%) greater than or equal to 28 mg. No cases of respiratory depression or sedation were reported. All 5 (0.8%) cases of precipitated withdrawal had no association with dose; 4 cases occurred after doses of 8 mg of buprenorphine. Three serious adverse events unrelated to buprenorphine were identified. Nausea or vomiting was rare (2%-6% of cases). The median (interquartile range) length of stay was 2.4 (1.6-3.75) hours. These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site urban ED, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated OUD. Further prospective investigations conducted in multiple sites would enhance these findings.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Blacks;Buprenorphine;Calendar;California;Data Analysis;Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Follow-Up Care;Homelessness;Hospitalization;Hospitals, Urban;Humans;Length of Stay;Male;Mental Disorders;Middle Aged;Nausea;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxygen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Respiratory Depression;Safety;Safety-net Hospitals;Safety-net Providers;Supplies;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Vital Signs;Vomiting",Mental Disorders;Nausea;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Respiratory Depression;Vomiting,JAMA Netw Open,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34315014,2021,Predictors of having naloxone in urban and rural Oregon findings from NHBS and the OR-HOPE study.,"Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be effectively administered by bystanders to prevent overdose. We determined the proportion of people who had naloxone and identified predictors of naloxone ownership among two samples of people who inject drugs (PWID) who use opioids in Portland and rural Western Oregon. We used data from participants in Portland's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS, N = 477) and the Oregon HIV/Hepatitis and Opioid Prevention and Engagement Study (OR-HOPE, N = 133). For each sample, we determined the proportion of participants who had naloxone and estimated unadjusted and adjusted relative risk of having naloxone associated with participant characteristics. Sixty one percent of NHBS and 30 % of OR-HOPE participants had naloxone. In adjusted analysis, having naloxone was associated with female gender, injecting goofballs (compared to heroin alone), housing stability, and overdose training in the urban NHBS sample, and having naloxone was associated with drug of choice, frequency of injection, and race in the rural OR-HOPE sample. In both samples, having naloxone was crudely associated with SSP use, but this was attenuated after adjustment. Naloxone ownership was insufficient and highly variable among two samples of PWID who use opioids in Oregon. People who use methamphetamine, males, and people experiencing homelessness may be at increased risk for not having naloxone and SSP may play a key role in improving access.","Adjustment;Drug Overdose;Female;Gender;HIV;Hepatitis;Heroin;Homelessness;Hope;Housing;Humans;Injections;Male;Methamphetamine;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Ownership;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Racial Stocks;Relative Risk;Risk;Role;Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Drug Overdose;Hepatitis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Persons with HCV/HIV and living with substance use are disadvantaged in benefiting from advances in HCV treatment. In this randomized controlled trial, participants with HCV/HIV were randomized between February 2016 and January 2017 to either care facilitation or control. Twelve-month follow-up assessments were completed in January 2018.Care facilitation group participants received motivation and strengths-based case management addressing retrieval of HCV viral load results, engagement in HCV/HIV care, and medication adherence. Control group participants received referral to HCV evaluation and an offer of assistance in making care appointments. Primary outcome was number of steps achieved along a series of 8 clinical steps (eg, receiving HCV results, initiating treatment, sustained virologic response [SVR]) of the HCV/HIV care continuum over 12 months postrandomization. Three hundred eighty-one individuals were screened and 113 randomized. Median age was 51 years; 58.4% of participants were male and 72.6% were Black/African American. Median HIV-1 viral load was 27 209 copies/mL, with 69% having a detectable viral load. Mean number of steps completed was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group vs controls (2.44 vs 1.68 steps; χ 2 [1] = 7.36, P = .0067). Men in the intervention group completed a statistically significantly higher number of steps than controls. Eleven participants achieved SVR with no difference by treatment group. The care facilitation intervention increased progress along the HCV/HIV care continuum, as observed for men and not women. Study findings also highlight continued challenges to achieve individual-patient SVR and population-level HCV elimination.

34459444,2022,Expanding Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Through Incentivized Continuing Education.,"Buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) has positive outcomes including reducing opioid-related morbidity and mortality. In March 2018, 58 of 102 counties in Illinois lacked access to medication for OUD. Rush University created a fellowship training program with financial incentives to help expand buprenorphine treatment in Illinois. Fellows first completed an online waiver course, then attended an in-person intensive training weekend, and finally participated in a 9-month webinar series. Demographic and prescribing data were collected from fellows, as well as a comparison group of providers outside the fellowship who only completed a waiver training. At the fellowship's end, 31 of 37 fellows (84%) reported they were actively prescribing buprenorphine. Of the 23 fellows who were not prescribing at the fellowship's beginning, 17 (74%) initiated prescribing by the end. Among the 16 nonfellowship subjects who only completed a waiver training, just two (13%) reported they were prescribing buprenorphine at the study period's end. Our study indicates that providers need more training beyond the waiver to initiate buprenorphine prescribing. When resources are available to address a health crisis such as OUD, this model offers an innovative mechanism for delivering continuing medical education that produces outcomes quickly.","Access To Medicines;Address;Buprenorphine;Demography;Education, Continuing;Education, Medical, Continuing;Fellowships;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Illinois;Incentives;Morbidity;Mortality;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Resources;Therapeutics;Training Programs;Universities",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Contin Educ Health Prof,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34495424,2022,Twelve-Month Retention in Opioid Agonist Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Among Patients With and Without HIV.,"Although opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is associated with positive health outcomes, including improved HIV management, long-term retention in OAT remains low among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Using data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS), we identify variables independently associated with OAT retention overall and by HIV status. Among 7,334 patients with OUD, 13.7% initiated OAT, and 27.8% were retained 12-months later. Likelihood of initiation and retention did not vary by HIV status. Variables associated with improved likelihood of retention included receiving buprenorphine (relative to methadone), receiving both buprenorphine and methadone at some point over the 12-month period, or diagnosis of HCV. History of homelessness was associated with a lower likelihood of retention. Predictors of retention were largely distinct between patients with HIV and patients without HIV. Findings highlight the need for clinical, systems, and research initiatives to better understand and improve OAT retention.","Aging;Analgesics, Opioid;Avena;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Diagnosis;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;History;Homelessness;Humans;Methadone;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patients;Relatives;Research;Therapeutics;Veterans;Veterans Health",HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,AIDS Behav,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34506517,2021,Designing and validating a Markov model for hospital-based addiction consult service impact on 12-month drug and non-drug related mortality.,"Addiction consult services (ACS) engage hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in care and help meet their goals for substance use treatment. Little is known about how ACS affect mortality for patients with OUD. The objective of this study was to design and validate a model that estimates the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We developed a Markov model of referral to an ACS, post-discharge engagement in SUD care, and 12-month drug-related and non-drug related mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD. We populated our model using Oregon Medicaid data and validated it using international modeling standards. There were 6,654 patients with OUD hospitalized from April 2015 through December 2017. There were 114 (1.7%) drug-related deaths and 408 (6.1%) non-drug related deaths at 12 months. Bayesian logistic regression models estimated four percent (4%, 95% CI = 2%, 6%) of patients were referred to an ACS. Of those, 47% (95% CI = 37%, 57%) engaged in post-discharge OUD care, versus 20% not referred to an ACS (95% CI = 16%, 24%). The risk of drug-related death at 12 months among patients in post-discharge OUD care was 3% (95% CI = 0%, 7%) versus 6% not in care (95% CI = 2%, 10%). The risk of non-drug related death was 7% (95% CI = 1%, 13%) among patients in post-discharge OUD treatment, versus 9% not in care (95% CI = 5%, 13%). We validated our model by evaluating its predictive, external, internal, face and cross validity. Our novel Markov model reflects trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD. This model can be used to evaluate the impact of other clinical and policy changes to improve patient survival.",Adult;Affect;Cohort Studies;Death;Face;Female;Goals;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Markov Chains;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Oregon;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Referral;Risk;Standards;Substance Use;Survival;Therapeutics,Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,PLoS One,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We examined long-term treatment experiences and outcomes by type of psychiatric disorder among participants who participated in the Starting Treatment with Agonist Replacement Therapies (START) study and its follow-up study. We categorized the 593 participants who completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) during the START follow-up study into four mutually exclusive groups to indicate current psychiatric diagnosis: 1) bipolar disorder (BPD; n = 51), 2) major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 85), 3) anxiety disorder (AXD; n = 121), and 4) no comorbid mental disorder (NMD; n = 336). We compared participants' baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes. Groups with mental disorders had worse substance use outcomes and poorer psychosocial functioning than the NMD group. Participants with BPD had significantly more self-reported days using opioids (Mean: 8.6 for BPD vs. 3.4 days for NMD, p &lt; 0.01) and heroin (Mean: 6.4 for BPD vs. 2.0 for MDD, 3.1 days for NMD, p &lt; 0.05) in the 30 days prior to the final interview. Compared to patients without mental disorders, patients with MDD spent more time engaged with OUD pharmacotherapy during the ∼16-month period between MINI and final interview (mean: 71.6 % vs. 50.6 %; p &lt; 0.001). Our results show that treatment outcomes in individuals with OUD vary by psychiatric comorbidity groups, which supports the need for mental health assessment and treatment for psychiatric conditions in the context of pharmacotherapy for patients with OUD.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety Disorders;Bipolar Disorder;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Depressive Disorder, Major;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Drug Therapy;Follow-Up Studies;Heroin;Humans;Interview;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Methadone;Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Psychosocial Functioning;Self;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time;Treatment Outcome","Anxiety Disorders;Bipolar Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

There is a shortage of OTPs, and racial and geographic inequities exist in access to methadone treatment. The National Institute on Drug Abuse Center for Clinical Trials Network convened the Methadone Access Research Task Force to develop a research agenda to expand and create more equitable access to methadone treatment for OUD. This research agenda included mechanisms that are available within and outside the current regulations. The task force identified 6 areas where research is needed: (1) access to methadone in general medical and other outpatient settings; (2) the impact of methadone treatment setting on patient outcomes; (3) impact of treatment structure on outcomes in patients receiving methadone; (4) comparative effectiveness of different medications to treat OUD; (5) optimal educational and support structure for provision of methadone by medical providers; and (6) benefits and harms of expanded methadone access. In addition to outlining these research priorities, the task force identified important cross-cutting issues, including the impact of patient characteristics, treatment, and treatment system characteristics such as methadone formulation and dose, concurrent behavioral treatment, frequency of dispensing, urine or oral fluid testing, and methods of measuring clinical outcomes. Together, the research priorities and cross-cutting issues represent a compelling research agenda to expand access to methadone in the US.","Advisory Committees;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Humans;Methadone;Methods;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Program;Regulation;Report;Research;Research Priorities;Therapeutics;United States;Urine",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34607194,2021,Do people with opioid use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder benefit from dding Individual opioid Drug Counseling to buprenorphine?,"Large randomized trials have found that behavioral therapy for opioid use disorder (e.g., Individual Drug Counseling, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Opioid Use Disorder) does not improve buprenorphine maintenance outcomes, on average, for individuals with opioid use disorder. However, recent studies indicate that certain subgroups of patients may benefit from the addition of behavioral therapy to buprenorphine. In particular, people with more complex and severe psychosocial needs may benefit from the addition of behavioral therapy for opioid use disorder. In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of a large, multi-site randomized trial (N = 357) of buprenorphine maintenance with and without individual Opioid Drug Counseling (ODC) for the treatment of opioid use disorder. We hypothesized that participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) would benefit from the addition of ODC. Logistic regression models indicated a significant PTSD by treatment condition interaction. Specifically, 67% of those with PTSD had a successful opioid use disorder treatment outcome when they were assigned to receive both ODC and buprenorphine, compared to a 36% response rate among those who received buprenorphine alone. Although these results require replication, our findings provide initial indication that ODC is an important complement to buprenorphine maintenance treatment for people with co-occurring PTSD and opioid use disorder.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Complement System Proteins;Counseling;Humans;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome","Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We performed an independent evaluation of the PDMP-based Narcotic Score (NS) metric. This study was a one-time, cross-sectional health assessment within 19 pharmacies from a national chain among adults picking-up opioid medications. The NS metric is a 3-digit composite indicator. The WHO Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was the gold-standard to which the NS metric was compared. Machine learning determined optimal risk thresholds; Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and Spearman (P) and Kappa (K) coefficients analyzed concurrent validity. Regression analyses evaluated participant characteristics associated with misclassification. The NS metric showed fair concurrent validity (area under the curve≥0.70; K=0.35; P = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001). The ASSIST and NS metric categorized 37% of participants as low-risk (i.e., not needing screening/intervention) and 32.3% as moderate/high-risk (i.e., needing screening/intervention). Further, 17.2% were categorized as low ASSIST risk but moderate/high NS metric risk, termed false positives. These reported disability (OR=3.12), poor general health (OR=0.66), and/or greater pain severity/interference (OR=1.12/1.09; all p &lt; 0.05; i.e., needing unmanaged-pain screening/intervention).

34698397,2021,Is extended release naltrexone superior to buprenorphine-naloxone to reduce drinking among outpatients receiving treatment for opioid use disorder? A secondary analysis of the CTN X:BOT trial.,"The comparative effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid relapse prevention (X:BOT) trial showed that following induction, treatment with the sublingual agonist (buprenorphine-naloxone, BUP-NX) or injected antagonist (extended release naltrexone, XR-NTX) produced similar reductions in opioid relapse in injection users with opioid use disorder (OUD). Because XR-NTX reduces drinking in alcohol use disorder (AUD), we conducted a secondary analysis of the X:BOT sample of patients successfully inducted onto treatment to determine whether XR-NTX (n = 204) was superior to BUP-NX (n = 270) in reducing drinking or heavy drinking in patients with OUD. Standard drink units consumed were measured using the Timeline Follow-back method. Mixed-models regression was used to examine the monthly frequency of any drinking and heavy drinking over 6 months of treatment. We used a proportional hazard survival analysis to examine the time to first drink. Both treatment groups reduced drinking from baseline to posttreatment (small to medium effect), but no differences between groups were detected. However, only 29% (n = 136) of the sample had AUD and 19% (n = 26/136) of those were abstinent before treatment. Analysis of a subsample enriched for possible drinking included 136 individuals with an AUD diagnosis plus 43 who did not have AUD, but reported at least one day of heavy drinking prior to the study. However, this subsample reported only 32% of days of any drinking with a median of only 13% of days designated as ""heavy."" Within this subsample, at baseline, the BUP-NX group reported more mean drinks per drinking day than the XR-NTX group (p = 0.03); however, there were no other significant group differences on drinking observed before, during, or at the end of treatment. There was an overall reduction in drinking during treatment of OUD using both agonist and antagonist medications, so that the hypothesis that XR-NTX would be superior to BUP-NX was not supported. The study is limited by low levels of comorbid AUD or heavy drinking observed in X:BOT trial participants seeking treatment for OUD.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Back;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trials as Topic;Delayed-Action Preparations;Diagnosis;Drinking;Humans;Injections;Methods;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Overall;Patients;Relapse;Relapse Prevention;Research Design;Standards;Survival Analysis;Therapeutics;Time",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34758881,2021,Feasibility and acceptability of electronic administration of patient reported outcomes using mHealth platform in emergency department patients with non-medical opioid use.,"The emergency department (ED) offers an important opportunity to identify patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and initiate treatment. However, post-ED follow-up is challenging, and novel approaches to enhance care transitions are urgently needed. Outcomes following ED visits have traditionally focused on overdose, treatment engagement, and mortality with an absence of patient reported outcomes (PROs), for example patient ability to schedule follow-up OUD treatment appointments or pick up a prescription medication, that may better inform evaluation of treatment pathways and near-term outcomes after acute events. In the context of increasing novel secure mobile health (mHealth) platforms, we explored the feasibility and acceptability of electronically collecting PROs from ED patients with non-medical opioid use to enhance care in the ED and transitions of care. ED patients with non-medical opioid use or opioid overdose who endorsed willingness and ability to complete electronic surveys after discharge were enrolled from a tertiary, urban academic ED. Participants were enrolled in an mHealth platform, shared electronic health records with researchers, and completed electronic surveys of PROs at baseline, three- and thirty-days post discharge from the hospital, including questions about ability to schedule a follow-up appointment, pick up a prescription medication and overdose risk behaviors. Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility and acceptability of electronic PRO collection among ED patients with non-medical opioid use. Among 1,808 patients assessed for eligibility between June-December 2019, 101 of 130 (78%) eligible adult patients consented to participate. Ninety-six (95%) of 101 patients completed registration in the mHealth platform, and 77/96 (80%) were successful in sharing their electronic health data. Completion rates for the baseline, three-day and thirty-day surveys were 97% (93/96), 49% (47/96) and 42% (40/96). Implementation challenges included short engagement window during ED visit, limited access to smartphones/computers, insufficient battery life of participant phone to access email and password, forgotten emails and passwords, multi-step verification processes for account set-up, and complaints about hospital care, most of which were effectively addressed by study personnel. ED patients with OUD were willing to share electronic health information and PROs, although implementation challenges were common, and more than half of participants were lost-to-follow-up after hospital discharge at 30 days. Efforts to streamline communication and remove barriers to engagement are needed to improve the collection of PROs and pathways of care in ED patients with OUD.

34772765,2021,Clinician Perceptions About a Decision Support System to Identify and Manage Opioid Use Disorder.,"Addressing the opioid epidemic would benefit from primary care clinicians identifying and managing opioid use disorder (OUD) during routine clinical encounters, but current rates are low. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are a promising way to facilitate such interactions, but will clinicians use them? We iteratively conducted semi-structured interviews with 8 purposively sampled primary care clinicians participating in a pilot OUD-CDS study to identify attitudes toward discussing OUD and preferences for support in doing so. Five of them had used a pilot version of the CDS for 6 months, while the others were in comparison clinics. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by a multi-disciplinary group of experienced researchers, using an editing organizing style where the analysts independently highlighted relevant text and then discussed to reach a consensus on themes. We identified five themes: 1. Primary care is the right place to address OUD. 2. Both clinician-patient and clinician-clinician relationships affect how and whether clinicians address OUD in a particular patient encounter. 3. The main challenges are limited time and competing priorities for these complex patients. 4. Although a CDS for OUD could be very helpful, it must meet different needs for different clinicians and clinical situations and be simple to use. 5. For optimal benefit, the CDS needs to be complemented by supportive organizational policies and systems as well as local clinician encouragement. With the right design and a supportive organization, these primary care clinicians believe a CDS could help them regularly identify and address OUD among their patients as long as it incorporates their concerns about relationships, competing priorities, patient complexity, and user simplicity.","Address;Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude;Attitude of Health Personnel;Clinical Decision Support;Clinical Decision-Making;Consensus;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Humans;Interview;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizational Policy;Organizations;Patients;Perception;Pilots;Primary Health Care;Research Personnel;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Am Board Fam Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Moreover, there are concerning trends among women. The aim of this article is to provide a review of opioid use disorder in women and the implications for treatment. A nonsystematic review of the literature as conducted to examine: (1) the epidemiology of opioid-related hospitalizations and deaths of women; (2) co-occurring pain, anxiety disorders, and trauma among women with opioid use disorder; (3) evidence for opioid agonist treatment of pregnant women with opioid use disorder; and (4) implications for treatment of women with opioid use disorder and next steps for research and practice. The current opioid epidemic has produced important differences by sex and gender with increased rates of use and overdose deaths in women. Significant mental health concerns for women include co-occurring psychiatric disorders and suicide. Expanding medication treatment for perinatal opioid use disorder is crucial. While effective treatments exist for opioid use disorder, they are often not accessible, and a minority of patients are treated. The end to the opioid epidemic will require innovative multi-systemic solutions. There are significant practice gaps in preventing rising death rates among women by opioid overdose, treating co-occurring psychiatric disorders and pain, and treating perinatal women with opioid use disorder and their infants. Research on sex and gender differences, and the intersection with race/ethnicity and US region, is critically needed and should include treatment implementation studies to achieve wider access for women to effective prevention, early intervention, and treatment.",Anxiety Disorders;Death;Death Rate;Epidemiology;Ethnic Groups;Gender;Hospitalization;Infant;Literature;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Persons;Pregnant Women;Professional Practice Gaps;Racial Stocks;Research;Review;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Solutions;Suicide;Therapeutics;Women;Wounds and Injuries,Anxiety Disorders;Death;Mental Disorders;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Wounds and Injuries,Psychiatr Res Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34916590,2022,A neuroeconomic signature of opioid craving: How fluctuations in craving bias drug-related and nondrug-related value.,"How does craving bias decisions to pursue drugs over other valuable, and healthier, alternatives in addiction? To address this question, we measured the in-the-moment economic decisions of people with opioid use disorder as they experienced craving, shortly after receiving their scheduled opioid maintenance medication and ~24 h later. We found that higher cravers had higher drug-related valuation, and that moments of higher craving within-person also led to higher drug-related valuation. When experiencing increased opioid craving, participants were willing to pay more for personalized consumer items and foods more closely related to their drug use, but not for alternative ""nondrug-related"" but equally desirable options. This selective increase in value with craving was greater when the drug-related options were offered in higher quantities and was separable from the effects of other fluctuating psychological states like negative mood. These findings suggest that craving narrows and focuses economic motivation toward the object of craving by selectively and multiplicatively amplifying perceived value along a ""drug relatedness"" dimension.","Address;Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior, Addictive;Bias;Craving;Economics;Food;Humans;Maintenance;Mood;Motivation;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Neuropsychopharmacology,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35025921,2022,Emergency department utilization for substance use disorders and mental health conditions during COVID-19.,"As the emergency department (ED) has evolved into the de-facto site of care for a variety of substance use disorder (SUD) presentations, trends in ED utilization are an essential public health surveillance tool. Changes in ED visit patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect changes in access to outpatient treatment, changes in SUD incidence, or the unintended effects of public policy to mitigate COVID-19. We use a national emergency medicine registry to describe and characterize trends in ED visitation for SUDs since 2019. We included all ED visits identified in a national emergency medicine clinical quality registry, which included 174 sites across 33 states with data from January 2019 through June 2021. We defined SUD using ED visit diagnosis codes including: opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD), alcohol use disorders (AUD), and other SUD. To characterize changes in ED utilization, we plotted the 3-week moving average ratio of visit counts in 2020 and 2021 as compared to visit counts in 2019. While overall ED visits declined in the early pandemic period and had not returned to 2019 baseline by June 2021, ED visit counts for SUD demonstrated smaller declines in March and April of 2020, so that the proportion of overall ED visits that were for SUD increased. Furthermore, in the second half of 2020, ED visits for SUD returned to baseline, and increased above baseline for OUD ever since May 2020. We observe distinct patterns in ED visitation for SUDs over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for OUD for which ED visitation barely declined and now exceeds previous baselines. These trends likely demonstrate the essential role of hospital-based EDs in providing 24/7/365 care for people with SUDs and mental health conditions. Allocation of resources must be directed towards the ED as a de-facto safety net for populations in crisis.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Ambulatory Care;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Diagnosis;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Hospitals;Humans;Incidence;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Outpatients;Overall;Pandemics;Persons;Population;Public Health Surveillance;Public Policy;Registries;Resource Allocation;Role;Safety;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics",Alcohol Use Disorder;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Mental Disorders;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,PLoS One,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35042101,2022,Cost of Hepatitis C care facilitation for HIV/Hepatitis C Co-infected people who use drugs.,"Using data from a randomized trial, we evaluated the cost of HCV care facilitation that supports moving along the continuum of care for HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with substance use disorder. Participants were HIV patients residing in the community, initially recruited from eight US hospital sites. They received HCV care facilitation (n = 51) or treatment as usual (n = 62) for up to six months. We used micro-costing methods to evaluate costs from the healthcare sector and patient perspectives in 2017 USD. We conducted sensitivity analyses varying care facilitator caseloads and examined offsetting savings using participant self-reported healthcare utilization. The average site start-up cost was $6320 (site range: $4320-$7000), primarily consisting of training. The mean weekly cost per participant was $20 (site range: $4-$30) for care facilitation visits and contacts, $360 (site range: $130- $700) for supervision and client outreach, and $70 (site range: $20-$180) for overhead. In sensitivity analyses applying a weekly caseload of 10 participants per care facilitator (versus 1-6 observed in the trial), the total mean weekly care facilitation cost from the healthcare sector perspective decreased to $110. Weekly participant time and travel costs averaged $7. There were no significant differences in other healthcare service costs between participants in the intervention and control arms. Weekly HCV care facilitation costs were approximately $450 per participant, but approximately $110 at a real-world setting maximum caseload of 10 participants per week. No healthcare cost offsets were identified during the trial period, although future savings might result from successful HCV treatment.",Arm;Clients;Coinfection;Community;Continuity of Patient Care;Cost;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Future;HIV;HIV Infections;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Health Care Sector;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hospitals;Humans;Methods;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Savings;Self;Sensitivity;Substance Use Disorders;Supervision;Therapeutics;Time;Travel,Coinfection;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35076700,2022,Perspectives About Emergency Department Care Encounters Among Adults With Opioid Use Disorder.,"Emergency departments (EDs) are increasingly initiating treatment for patients with untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) and linking them to ongoing addiction care. To our knowledge, patient perspectives related to their ED visit have not been characterized and may influence their access to and interest in OUD treatment. To assess the experiences and perspectives regarding ED-initiated health care and OUD treatment among US patients with untreated OUD seen in the ED. This qualitative study, conducted as part of 2 studies (Project ED Health and ED-CONNECT), included individuals with untreated OUD who were recruited during an ED visit in EDs at 4 urban academic centers, 1 public safety net hospital, and 1 rural critical access hospital in 5 disparate US regions. Focus groups were conducted between June 2018 and January 2019. Data collection and thematic analysis were grounded in the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) implementation science framework with evidence (perspectives on ED care), context (ED), and facilitation (what is needed to promote change) elements. A total of 31 individuals (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [11.0] years) participated in 6 focus groups. Twenty participants (64.5%) identified as male and most 13 (41.9%) as White; 17 (54.8%) reported being unemployed. Themes related to evidence included patients' experience of stigma and perceived minimization of their pain and medical problems by ED staff. Themes about context included the ED not being seen as a source of OUD treatment initiation and patient readiness to initiate treatment being multifaceted, time sensitive, and related to internal and external patient factors. Themes related to facilitation of improved care of patients with OUD seen in the ED included a need for on-demand treatment and ED staff training. In this qualitative study, patients with OUD reported feeling stigmatized and minimized when accessing care in the ED and identified several opportunities to improve care. The findings suggest that strategies to address stigma, acknowledge and treat pain, and provide ED staff training should be implemented to improve ED care for patients with OUD and enhance access to life-saving treatment.","Address;Adult;Data Collection;Elements;Emergency Service, Hospital;Feelings;Female;Focus Groups;Health;Health Care;Health Services;Hospitals;Humans;Implementation Science;Knowledge;Life;Male;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Qualitative Research;Research;Safety-net Hospitals;Savings;Social Stigma;Stereotyping;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Whites",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,JAMA Netw Open,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35089579,2022,A Systematic Review of Trauma and Substance Use in American Indian and Alaska Native Individuals: Incorporating Cultural Considerations.,"Disproportionate rates of psychiatric disorders, like substance use and posttraumatic stress disorders (SUD and PTSD), exist among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals. This review examines substance use and trauma in existing AI/AN literature and utilizes an AI/AN-specific model to culturally inform the relationship between these factors and provide recommendations for future research. We searched three databases through April 2021 for peer-reviewed articles that examined substance use and trauma in AI/AN individuals. The search identified 289 articles and of those, 42 were eligible for inclusion, including 36 quantitative and 6 qualitative studies. Rates of lifetime trauma exposure varied from 21 to 98% and were correlated with increased rates of SUDs. A dose response of traumatic events also increased the likelihood of an SUD among reservation-based AI populations. Factors from the Indigenist Stress Coping model included cultural buffers such as traditional healing and cultural identity, which aided in recovery from SUD and trauma, and social stressors like boarding school attendance, discrimination, and historical loss. SUD and trauma are highly correlated among AI/AN individuals though rates of PTSD are lower than might be expected suggesting resilience. However, this pattern may not be consistent across all AI/AN groups and further research is needed to better explain the existing relationship of SUD and PTSD and relevant historical and cultural factors. Further research is needed to culturally tailor, implement, and validate PTSD and SUD assessments and treatments to ameliorate these health inequities.","Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Buffers;Database;Future;Health;Literature;Mental Disorders;Population;Research;Review;Schools;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Wounds and Injuries","Mental Disorders;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Wounds and Injuries",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35118756,2022,Are x-waiver trainings enough? Facilitators and barriers to buprenorphine prescribing after x-waiver trainings.,"In the United States, an x-waiver credential is necessary to prescribe buprenorphine medication treatment for opioid use disorder (B-MOUD). Historically, this process has required certified training, which could be a barrier to obtaining an x-waiver and subsequently prescribing. To address this barrier, the US recently removed the training requirement for some clinicians. We sought to determine if clinicians who attended x-waiver training went on to obtain an x-waiver and prescribe B-MOUD, and to examine what facilitated or impeded B-MOUD prescribing. In September 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey of attendees of 15 in-person x-waiver pieces of training from June 2018 to January 2020 within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Of the attendees (n = 321), we surveyed current VHA clinicians who recalled taking the training. The survey assessed whether clinicians obtained the x-waiver, had prescribed B-MOUD, and barriers or facilitators that influenced B-MOUD prescribing. Of 251 eligible participants, 62 (24.7%) responded to the survey, including 27 (43.5%) physicians, 16 (25.8%) advanced practice clinicians, and 12 (19.4%) pharmacists. Of the 43 clinicians who could prescribe, 29 (67.4%) had obtained their x-waiver and 16 (37.2%) had reported prescribing B-MOUD. Prominent barriers to prescribing B-MOUD included a lack of supporting clinical staff and competing demands on time. The primary facilitator to prescribing was leadership support. Nine months after x-waiver training, two-thirds of clinicians with prescribing credentials had obtained their x-waiver and one-third were prescribing B-MOUD. Removing the x-waiver training may not have the intended policy effect as other barriers to B-MOUD prescribing persist.",Address;Administration;Buprenorphine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronics;Humans;Leadership;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Pharmacists;Physicians;Policy;Surveys;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Veterans Health,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Am J Addict,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We tested whether outpatient antagonist treatment with naltrexone could achieve similar results. Open-label, non-inferiority randomized trial. Six US HIV primary care clinics. A total of 114 participants with untreated HIV and OUD (62% male; 56% black, 12% Hispanic; positive for fentanyl (62%), other opioids (47%) and cocaine (60%) at baseline). Enrollment halted early due to slow recruitment. HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; n = 55) versus treatment as usual (TAU) with buprenorphine or methadone (TAU; n = 59). Treatment group differences were compared for the primary outcome of viral suppression (HIV RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml) at 24 weeks and secondary outcomes included past 30-day use of opioids at 24 weeks. Fewer XR-NTX participants initiated medication compared with TAU participants (47 versus 73%). The primary outcome of viral suppression was comparable for XR-NTX (52.7%) and TAU (49.2%) [risk ratio (RR) = 1.064; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.748, 1.514] at 24 weeks. Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated, as the lower confidence limit of the RR did not exceed the pre-specified margin of 0.75 in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The main secondary outcome of past 30-day opioid use was comparable for XR-NTX versus TAU (11.7 versus 14.8 days; mean difference = -3.1; 95% CI = -8.7, 1.1) in ITT analysis. Among those initiating medication, XR-NTX resulted in fewer days of opioid use compared with TAU in the past 30 days (6.0 versus 13.6, mean difference = -7.6; 95% CI = -13.8, -0.2). A randomized controlled trial found supportive, but not conclusive, evidence that human immunodeficiency virus clinic-based extended-release naltrexone is not inferior to treatment as usual for facilitating human immunodeficiency virus viral suppression. Participants who initiated extended-release naltrexone used fewer opioids than those who received treatment as usual.","Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Buprenorphine;Cocaine;Confidence Intervals;Delayed-Action Preparations;Female;Fentanyl;HIV;HIV Infections;Hispanics;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Intention;Male;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Non-Inferiority Trial;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Persons;Primary Health Care;RNA;Randomized Controlled Trial;Therapeutics",HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35156912,2022,Identifying opioid-related electronic health record phenotypes for emergency care research and surveillance: An expert consensus driven concept mapping process.,"Background: Case identification for many areas of opioid research and surveillance in the emergency department (ED) is challenging as patients are often undifferentiated with nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic codes have proven to be inaccurate. Opioid-related phenotypes based on combinations of electronic health record data are a promising method to address this gap but lack a consensus-based conceptual framework to aid organization and prioritization. Methods: To achieve consensus around opioid-related phenotype topics in the ED, we used a hybrid scheme that employed modified Delphi and conceptual mapping methods. The combined iterative process used three rounds of electronic meetings and questionnaires to generate consensus recommendations and concept mappings based on the opinions and feedback of the 9 member Delphi panel. Mean importance and feasibility scores based on 5-point Likert scales (1 = relatively unimportant (infeasible) to 5 = extremely important (feasible)) for each statement/phenotype were calculated. We used multidimensional scaling to produce a point map of the phenotype concepts and hierarchical cluster analysis to generate concept maps. Results: After the first round, 120 initial phenotype concepts were proposed which were reduced to 73 concepts after normalization by the research team. Opioid overdose (9.54, SD = 0.9) had the highest combined importance and feasibility score. A final labeled 12-cluster solution was determined to be the most parsimonious description of the content by the research team. Three key groups emerged: opioid overdose, other opioid-specific phenotypes (opioid use disorder, opioid misuse, and opioid withdrawal) with significant concept overlap and opioid use-related phenotypes (homelessness, falls, infections, and suicidality). Conclusions: Using an expert consensus driven concept mapping process we identified specific opioid phenotype concepts within an overlapping schema that carry high priority for development and validation to advance emergency care opioid-related research and surveillance.","Accidental Falls;Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Cluster Analysis;Consensus;Delphi Technique;Electronic Health Records;Electronics;Emergency Care;Emergency Medical Services;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Feedback;Homelessness;Humans;Hybrids;Infections;Informatics;Map;Methods;Multidimensional Scaling Analysis;Opiate Overdose;Opinions;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Patients;Phenotype;Questionnaires;Research;Scales;Solutions",Infections;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35194740,2023,"Trends in Health Service Utilization After Enrollment in an Interdisciplinary Primary Care Clinic for Veterans with Addiction, Social Determinants of Health, or Other Vulnerabilities.","Models of interdisciplinary primary care (IPC) may improve upon traditional primary care approaches in addressing addiction and social determinants of health. To compare the trends in health care utilization in the year before and after enrollment in an IPC clinic model, and explore the variations in temporal patterns for patients with histories of high emergency department (ED) use, homelessness, and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). Interrupted time series study of utilization among IPC patients. Quarterly ED, inpatient, primary care, and behavioral health visits were abstracted from administrative data before and after IPC enrollment. Negative binomial segmented regressions estimated changes in health care utilization over time. We used interactions to test for statistical differences in temporal patterns for IPC subgroups. Among IPC patients (n=994), enrollment was associated with overall reductions in ED, inpatient, and behavioral health visits (p's&lt;0.001) and increases in primary care (p's&lt;0.001). Temporal patterns of ED visits, hospitalizations, and behavioral health differed across IPC subgroups (interaction p's&lt;0.001). For those with histories of high ED use (n=265), ED, inpatient, and behavioral health visits decreased after enrollment (level change incidence rate ratios [IRRs]=0.57-0.69) and continued to decline over time (post-enrollment IRRs=0.80-0.88). Among other patients with homeless experiences (n=123), there were initial declines in hospitalizations (IRR=0.33) and overall declines in behavioral health visits (level change and post-enrollment IRRs=0.46-0.94). Other patients with SUDs had initial declines in hospitalizations (IRR=0.46), and post-enrollment declines in rates of specialty SUD visits (IRR=0.92). For all patients, primary care visits initially increased (level change IIRs=2.47-1.34) then gradually declined (post-enrollment IRRs=0.92-0.92). An IPC model of care reduces acute care and behavioral health service use, particularly for patients with historically high ED use. IPC models may improve patient and system outcomes of vulnerable patient populations with social, clinical, and addiction morbidities.","Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Health Services;History;Homelessness;Hospitalization;Incidence Rate;Inpatients;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Morbidity;Opioid Use Disorder;Overall;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Population;Primary Health Care;Social Determinants of Health;Substance Use Disorders;Time;Veterans",Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35218405,2022,Moderation of buprenorphine therapy for cocaine dependence efficacy by variation of the Prodynorphin gene.,"The aim of this secondary analysis was to identify prodynorphin (PDYN) genetic markers moderating the therapeutic response to treatment of cocaine dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone®; BUP). Cocaine-dependent participants (N = 302) were randomly assigned to a platform of injectable, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and one of three daily medication arms: 4 mg BUP (BUP4), 16 mg BUP (BUP16), or placebo (PLB) for 8 weeks (Parent Trial Registration: Protocol ID: NIDA-CTN-0048, Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT01402492). DNA was obtained from 277 participants. Treatment response was determined from weeks 3 to 7 over each 1-week period by the number of cocaine-positive urines per total possible urines. In the cross-ancestry group, the PLB group had more cocaine-positive urines than the BUP16 group (P = 0.0021). The interactions of genetic variant × treatment were observed in the rs1022563 A-allele carrier group where the BUP16 group (N = 35) had fewer cocaine-positive urines (P = 0.0006) than did the PLB group (N = 26) and in the rs1997794 A-allele carrier group where the BUP16 group (N = 49) had fewer cocaine-positive urines (P = 0.0003) than did the PLB group (N = 58). No difference was observed in the rs1022563 GG or rs1997794 GG genotype groups between the BUP16 and PLB groups. In the African American-ancestry subgroup, only the rs1022563 A-allele carrier group was associated with treatment response. These results suggest that PDYN variants may identify patients who are best suited to treatment with XR-NTX plus buprenorphine for cocaine use disorder pharmacotherapy.","African Americans;Alleles;Arm;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Cocaine;Cocaine Dependence;Cocaine-Related Disorders;DNA;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Therapy;Enkephalins;Genes;Genetic Markers;Genetics;Genotype;Humans;Id;Injectables;Injections, Intramuscular;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid-Related Disorders;Parents;Patients;Placebos;Protein Precursors;Suboxone;Therapeutics;Urine",Cocaine Dependence;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

35316690,2022,Risky alcohol use among patients dispensed opioid medications: A clinical community pharmacy study.,"Included among the significant risk factors for opioid overdose is concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, particularly alcohol. Given the continued expansion of community pharmacy in the continuum of care, it is imperative to characterize alcohol use among pharmacy patients dispensed opioids in order to establish a foundation for identification and intervention in these settings. This secondary analysis utilized data from a one-time, cross-sectional health assessment conducted among patients dispensed opioid medications in 19 community pharmacies in Indiana and Ohio. Adult, English speaking, patients not receiving cancer care who were dispensed opioid medications were asked to self-report alcohol and substance use, behavioral and physical health, and demographic information. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were employed to characterize alcohol use/risky alcohol use and patient characteristics associated therewith. The analytical sample included 1494 individuals. Participants were on average 49 years of age (Standard Deviation=14.9)-with 6% being persons of color (n = 89). Weekly drinking was reported by 18.1% (n = 204) and daily drinking was reported by 6.8% (n = 77) of the study sample, with a total of 143 (9.6%) participants reporting moderate/high risk drinking. Males (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=1.94, 95% CI=1.3,2.9), those with higher pain interference (AOR=1.44, 95% CI=1.0,2.0), overdose history (AOR=1.93, 95% CI=1.1,3.5), sedative use (AOR=2.11, 95% CI=1.3,3.5), and tobacco use (AOR=2.41, 95% CI=1.6,3.7) had increased likelihood of moderate/high risk alcohol use (all p &lt; 0.05). Medication labeling and clinical guidelines clearly indicate that patients should abstain from concomitant use of opioids and alcohol. This study has identified rates and associated risk factors of risky alcohol use among a clinical sample of community pharmacy patients dispensed opioid medications. Continuing this line of research and potential clinical service development has the ability to improve patient safety through addressing a significant gap within the current opioid epidemic.","Ability;Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Cancer;Central Nervous System Depressants;Clinical Practice Guideline;Color;Community Pharmacies;Continuity of Patient Care;Cross-Sectional Studies;Demography;Drinking;Drug Overdose;Foundations;Health;History;Humans;Indiana;Logistic Regression;Male;Odds Ratio;Ohio;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pain;Patient Safety;Patients;Persons;Pharmacy;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Sedatives;Self Report;Standards;Substance Use;Time;Tobacco Use",Cancer;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Pain;Substance Use,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Our hypotheses were that greater agonist dose and therapeutic engagement would be associated with reduced illicit opiate use in a time-dependent manner. Publicly-available treatment data from six buprenorphine efficacy and safety trials from the Federally-supported Clinical Trials Network were used to derive treatment variables. Three novel predictors were constructed to capture the time weighted effects of buprenorphine dosage (mg buprenorphine per day), dosing protocol (whether physician could adjust dose), and clinic visits (whether patient attended clinic). We used time-in-trial as a predictor to account for the therapeutic benefits of treatment persistence. The outcome was illicit opiate use defined by self-report or urinalysis. Trial participants (N = 3022 patients with opioid dependence, mean age 36 years, 33% female, 14% Black, 16% Hispanic) were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model.

Effective strategies for retaining persons on MOUD, an essential step to improving outcomes, are needed as roughly half of all persons initiating MOUD discontinue within a year. Data science may be valuable and promising for improving MOUD retention by using ""big data"" (e.g., electronic health record data, claims data mobile/sensor data, social media data) and specific machine learning techniques (e.g., predictive modeling, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) to individualize patient care. Maximizing the utility of data science to improve MOUD retention requires a three-pronged approach: (1) increasing funding for data science research for OUD, (2) integrating data from multiple sources including treatment for OUD and general medical care as well as data not specific to medical care (e.g., mobile, sensor, and social media data), and (3) applying multiple data science approaches with integrated big data to provide insights and optimize advances in the OUD and overall addiction fields.","Analgesics, Opioid;Big Data;Buprenorphine;Data Science;Electronic Health Records;Humans;Learning;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patient Care;Persons;Research;Social Media;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

35623797,2022,Development and multimodal validation of a substance misuse algorithm for referral to treatment using artificial intelligence (SMART-AI): a retrospective deep learning study.,"Substance misuse is a heterogeneous and complex set of behavioural conditions that are highly prevalent in hospital settings and frequently co-occur. Few hospital-wide solutions exist to comprehensively and reliably identify these conditions to prioritise care and guide treatment. The aim of this study was to apply natural language processing (NLP) to clinical notes collected in the electronic health record (EHR) to accurately screen for substance misuse. The model was trained and developed on a reference dataset derived from a hospital-wide programme at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago, IL, USA, that used structured diagnostic interviews to manually screen admitted patients over 27 months (between Oct 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019; n=54 915). The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test and Drug Abuse Screening Tool served as reference standards. The first 24 h of notes in the EHR were mapped to standardised medical vocabulary and fed into single-label, multilabel, and multilabel with auxillary-task neural network models. Temporal validation of the model was done using data from the subsequent 12 months on a subset of RUMC patients (n=16 917). External validation was done using data from Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA between Jan 1, 2007, and Sept 30, 2017 (n=1991 adult patients). The primary outcome was discrimination for alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, or non-opioid drug misuse. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Calibration slope and intercept were measured with the unreliability index. Bias assessments were performed across demographic subgroups. The model was trained on a cohort that had 3·5% misuse (n=1 921) with any type of substance. 220 (11%) of 1921 patients with substance misuse had more than one type of misuse. The multilabel convolutional neural network classifier had a mean AUROC of 0·97 (95% CI 0·96-0·98) during temporal validation for all types of substance misuse. The model was well calibrated and showed good face validity with model features containing explicit mentions of aberrant drug-taking behaviour. A false-negative rate of 0·18-0·19 and a false-positive rate of 0·03 between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White groups occurred. In external validation, the AUROCs for alcohol and opioid misuse were 0·88 (95% CI 0·86-0·90) and 0·94 (0·92-0·95), respectively. We developed a novel and accurate approach to leveraging the first 24 h of EHR notes for screening multiple types of substance misuse.

35651523,2022,Development and implementation of a prescription opioid registry across diverse health systems.,"Develop and implement a prescription opioid registry in 10 diverse health systems across the US and describe trends in prescribed opioids between 2012 and 2018. Using electronic health record and claims data, we identified patients who had an outpatient fill for any prescription opioid, and/or an opioid use disorder diagnosis, between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. The registry contains distributed files of prescription opioids, benzodiazepines and other select medications, opioid antagonists, clinical diagnoses, procedures, health services utilization, and health plan membership. Rates of outpatient opioid fills over the study period, standardized to health system demographic distributions, are described by age, gender, and race/ethnicity among members without cancer. The registry includes 6 249 710 patients and over 40 million outpatient opioid fills. For the combined registry population, opioid fills declined from a high of 0.718 per member-year in 2013 to 0.478 in 2018, and morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per fill declined from 985 MMEs per fill in 2012 to 758 MMEs in 2018. MMEs per member declined from 692 MMEs per member in 2012 to 362 MMEs per member in 2018. This study established a population-based opioid registry across 10 diverse health systems that can be used to address questions related to opioid use. Initial analyses showed large reductions in overall opioid use per member among the combined health systems. The registry will be used in future studies to answer a broad range of other critical public health issues relating to prescription opioid use.",Address;Benzodiazepines;Cancer;Demography;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Ethnic Groups;Future;Gender;Health;Health Services;Morphine;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Outpatients;Overall;Patients;Population;Prescriptions;Procedures;Public Health;Racial Stocks;Registries,Cancer;Opioid Use Disorder,JAMIA Open,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35707859,2022,Sex Differences in Comorbid Mental and Substance Use Disorders Among Primary Care Patients With Opioid Use Disorder.,"The authors sought to characterize the 3-year prevalence of mental disorders and nonnicotine substance use disorders among male and female primary care patients with documented opioid use disorder across large U.S. health systems. This retrospective study used 2014-2016 data from patients ages ≥16 years in six health systems. Diagnoses were obtained from electronic health records or claims data; opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine or injectable extended-release naltrexone was determined through prescription and procedure data. Adjusted prevalence of comorbid conditions among patients with opioid use disorder (with or without treatment), stratified by sex, was estimated by fitting logistic regression models for each condition and applying marginal standardization. Females (53.2%, N=7,431) and males (46.8%, N=6,548) had a similar prevalence of opioid use disorder. Comorbid mental disorders among those with opioid use disorder were more prevalent among females (86.4% vs. 74.3%, respectively), whereas comorbid other substance use disorders (excluding nicotine) were more common among males (51.9% vs. 60.9%, respectively). These differences held for those receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder, with mental disorders being more common among treated females (83% vs. 71%) and other substance use disorders more common among treated males (68% vs. 63%). Among patients with a single mental health condition comorbid with opioid use disorder, females were less likely than males to receive medication treatment for opioid use disorder (15% vs. 20%, respectively). The high rate of comorbid conditions among patients with opioid use disorder indicates a strong need to supply primary care providers with adequate resources for integrated opioid use disorder treatment.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Humans;Injectables;Logistic Regression;Male;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Naltrexone;Needs;Nicotine;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Procedures;Resources;Retrospective Studies;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Standardization;Substance Use Disorders;Supplies;Therapeutics",Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Psychiatr Serv,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35752520,2022,Models for Implementing Emergency Department-Initiated Buprenorphine With Referral for Ongoing Medication Treatment at Emergency Department Discharge in Diverse Academic Centers.,"There has been a substantial rise in the number of publications and training opportunities on the care and treatment of emergency department (ED) patients with opioid use disorder over the past several years. The American College of Emergency Physicians recently published recommendations for providing buprenorphine to patients with opioid use disorder, but barriers to implementing this clinical practice remain. We describe the models for implementing ED-initiated buprenorphine at 4 diverse urban, academic medical centers across the country as part of a federally funded effort termed ""Project ED Health."" These 4 sites successfully implemented unique ED-initiated buprenorphine programs as part of a comparison of implementation facilitation to traditional educational dissemination on the uptake of ED-initiated buprenorphine. Each site describes the elements central to the ED process, including screening, treatment initiation, referral, and follow-up, while harnessing organizational characteristics, including ED culture. Finally, we discuss common facilitators to program success, including information technology and electronic medical record integration, hospital-level support, strong connections with outpatient partners, and quality improvement processes.","Academic Medical Centers;Buprenorphine;Culture;Electronic Health Records;Elements;Emergencies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Hospitals;Humans;Information Technology;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Outpatients;Patient Discharge;Patients;Physicians;Program;Publications;Quality Improvement;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Screening;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Ann Emerg Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35773113,2022,Polysubstance use before and during treatment with medication for opioid use disorder: Prevalence and association with treatment outcomes.,"Polysubstance use may complicate treatment outcomes for individuals who use opioids. This research aimed to examine the prevalence of polysubstance use in an opioid use disorder treatment trial population and polysubstance use's association with opioid relapse and craving. This study is a secondary data analysis of individuals with opioid use disorder who received at least one dose of medication (n = 474) as part of a 24-week, multi-site, open label, randomized Clinical Trials Network study (CTN0051, X:BOT) comparing the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine. Models examined pretreatment polysubstance use and polysubstance use during the initial 4 weeks of treatment on outcomes of relapse by week 24 of the treatment trial and opioid craving. Polysubstance use was generally not associated with treatment outcomes of opioid relapse and craving. Proportion of days of pretreatment sedative use was associated with increased likelihood of opioid relapse (OR: 1.01, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.02). Proportion of days of cocaine use during the initial 4 weeks of treatment was associated with increased likelihood of opioid relapse (OR: 1.05, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.09) but this effect was no longer significant once the potential of confounding by opioid use was considered. Sedative use during initial 4 weeks of treatment was associated with increased opioid craving (b: 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.01-1.52). The study found no other significant relationships. In the current study population, polysubstance use was only marginally associated with 24-week treatment outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Cocaine;Craving;Data Analysis;Delayed-Action Preparations;Humans;Hypnotics and Sedatives;Injections, Intramuscular;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Population;Prevalence;Recurrence;Relapse;Research;Sedatives;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Relapse,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35815386,2023,The association between buprenorphine treatment duration and mortality: a multi-site cohort study of people who discontinued treatment.,"Buprenorphine is an effective medication for opioid use disorder that reduces mortality; however, many patients are not retained in buprenorphine treatment, and an optimal length of treatment after which patients can safely discontinue treatment has not been identified. This study measured the association between buprenorphine treatment duration and all-cause mortality among patients who discontinued treatment. Secondary objectives were to measure the association between treatment duration and drug overdose and opioid-related overdoses. Multi-site cohort study. Eight US health systems. Patients who initiated and discontinued buprenorphine treatment between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2018 (n = 6550). Outcomes occurring after patients discontinued buprenorphine treatment were compared between patients who initiated and discontinued treatment after 8-30, 31-90, 91-180, 181-365 and &gt; 365 days. Covariate data were obtained from electronic health records (EHRs). Mortality outcomes were derived from EHRs and state vital statistics. Non-fatal opioid and drug overdoses were obtained from diagnostic codes. Four sites provided cause-of-death data to identify fatal drug and opioid-related overdoses. Adjusted frailty regression was conducted on a propensity-weighted cohort to assess associations between duration of the final treatment episode and outcomes. The mortality rate after buprenorphine treatment was 1.82 per 100 person-years (n = 191 deaths). In regression analyses with &gt; 365 days as the reference group, treatment duration was not associated with all-cause mortality and drug overdose (P &gt; 0.05 for both). However, compared with &gt; 365 days of treatment, 91-180 days of treatment was associated with increased opioid overdose risk (hazard ratio = 2.94, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-7.79). Among patients who discontinue buprenorphine treatment, there appears to be no treatment duration period associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality. Patients who discontinue buprenorphine treatment after 91-180 days appear to be at heightened risk for opioid overdose compared with patients who discontinue after &gt; 365 days of treatment.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Cause of Death;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Death;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Duration of Therapy;Electronic Health Records;Frailty;Health;Humans;Measures;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Regression Analysis;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Therapeutics;Vital Statistics",Death;Drug Overdose;Frailty;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35886733,2022,The Identification of Subphenotypes and Associations with Health Outcomes in Patients with Opioid-Related Emergency Department Encounters Using Latent Class Analysis.,"The emergency department (ED) is a critical setting for the treatment of patients with opioid misuse. Detecting relevant clinical profiles allows for tailored treatment approaches. We sought to identify and characterize subphenotypes of ED patients with opioid-related encounters. A latent class analysis was conducted using 14,057,302 opioid-related encounters from 2016 through 2017 using the National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the largest all-payer ED database in the United States. The optimal model was determined by face validity and information criteria-based metrics. A three-step approach assessed class structure, assigned individuals to classes, and examined characteristics between classes. Class associations were determined for hospitalization, in-hospital death, and ED charges. The final five-class model consisted of the following subphenotypes: Chronic pain (class 1); Alcohol use (class 2); Depression and pain (class 3); Psychosis, liver disease, and polysubstance use (class 4); and Pregnancy (class 5). Using class 1 as the reference, the greatest odds for hospitalization occurred in classes 3 and 4 (Ors 5.24 and 5.33, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and for in-hospital death in class 4 (OR 3.44, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Median ED charges ranged from USD 2177 (class 1) to USD 2881 (class 4). These subphenotypes provide a basis for examining patient-tailored approaches for this patient population.","Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Charges;Chronic Pain;Database;Death;Depression;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Hospital Mortality;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Latent Class Analysis;Liver Diseases;Metric;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Pain;Patients;Population;Pregnancy;Psychotic Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Validity of Results",Chronic Pain;Death;Liver Diseases;Opioid Misuse;Pain;Psychotic Disorders,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35933891,2022,Five-year incidence of substance use and mental health diagnoses following exposure to opioids or opioids with benzodiazepines during an emergency department encounter for traumatic injury.,"Benzodiazepines and opioids are used alone or in conjunction in certain care settings, but each have the potential for misuse. This longitudinal observational study evaluated substance use and mental health outcomes associated with providing opioids with or without benzodiazepine to treat traumatic injury in the emergency department (ED) setting. We analyzed a limited dataset obtained through the IBM Watson Health Explorys. Matched cohorts were defined for: 1) patients treated with opioids during the ED encounter (ED-Opioid) vs. neither opioid or benzodiazepine treatment (No medication) (n = 5372); 2) patients treated with opioids and benzodiazepines during the ED encounter (ED-Opioid+Benzodiazepines) vs. No Medication (n = 2454); and 3) ED-Opioid+Benzodiazepines vs. ED-Opioid (n = 2454). Patients consisted of adults with an emergency department encounter in the MetroHealth System (Cleveland, Ohio) with a chief complaint of traumatic injury and medical records for five years following the encounter. Control patients for each cohort were matched to the exposure patients on demographics, body mass index, and residential zip code median income. Outcomes were five-year incidence rates for alcohol, substance use, depression, and anxiety-related diagnoses. Our results indicate that, although receiving opioids during the ED visit predicted a relatively lower likelihood of subsequent substance use and mental health diagnoses, the brief co-use of benzodiazepines was strongly associated with poorer outcomes. Even brief exposure to co-prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines during emergency traumatic injury care may be associated with negative substance use and mental health consequences in the years following the event.","Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Benzodiazepines;Body Mass Index;Dataset;Demography;Depression;Diagnosis;Emergencies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Humans;Incidence;Incidence Rate;Income;Injuries;Medical Records;Mental Health;Observational Study;Ohio;Opioids;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics",Injuries;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

36037051,2022,Development and Testing of a Communication Intervention to Improve Chronic Pain Management in Primary Care: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Effective communication skills are essential for optimally managing chronic pain and opioids. This exploratory, sequential mixed methods study tested the effect of a novel framework designed to improve pain-related communication and outcomes. Study 1 developed a novel 5-step framework for helping primary care clinicians discuss chronic pain and opioids with patients. Study 2 pilot tested an intervention for teaching this framework using standardized patient instructors-actors trained to portray patients and provide immediate clinician feedback-deployed during regular clinic hours. Primary care physicians were randomized to receive either the intervention or pain management recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Primary outcomes were pain-related interference at 2 months and clinician use of targeted communication skills (coded from transcripts of audio-recorded visits); secondary outcomes were pain intensity at 2 months, clinician self-efficacy for communicating about chronic pain, patient experience, and clinician-reported visit difficulty. We enrolled 47 primary care physicians from 2 academic teaching clinics and recorded visits with 48 patients taking opioids for chronic pain who had an appointment scheduled with an enrolled physician. The intervention was not associated with significant changes in primary or secondary outcomes other than clinician self-efficacy, which was significantly greater in the intervention group. This study developed a novel framework and intervention for teaching clinician pain-related communications skills. Although the intervention showed promise, more intensive or multicomponent interventions may be needed to have a significant impact on clinicians' pain-related communication and pain outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Appointments;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Communication;Feedback;Humans;Methods;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Primary Health Care;Self Efficacy;Teaching",Chronic Pain;Pain,Clin J Pain,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Non-opioid and nonpharmacological approaches to pain management are recommended. Opioids should not be withheld from anyone if necessary to treat pain, and a team-based approach, including pain and addiction specialists, should be utilized when possible. Pain management should include interventions aimed at minimizing the risk for relapse or escalation of problematic substance use, and actively involve the person and their support persons in the plan of care.

36362628,2022,Suicidality as a Predictor of Overdose among Patients with Substance Use Disorders.,"Increasing rates of overdose and overdose deaths are a significant public health problem. Research has examined co-occurring mental health conditions, including suicidality, as a risk factor for intentional and unintentional overdose among individuals with substance use disorder (SUD). However, this research has been limited to single site studies of self-reported outcomes. The current research evaluated suicidality as a predictor of overdose events in 2541 participants who use substances enrolled across eight multi-site clinical trials completed within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network between 2012 to 2021. The trials assessed baseline suicidality with the Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report (CHRT-SR). Overdose events were determined by reports of adverse events, cause of death, or hospitalization due to substance overdose, and verified through a rigorous adjudication process. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess continuous CHRT-SR score as a predictor of overdose, controlling for covariates. CHRT-SR score was associated with overdose events (p = 0.03) during the trial; the likelihood of overdose increased as continuous CHRT score increased (OR 1.02). Participants with lifetime heroin use were more likely to overdose (OR 3.08).

36399352,2022,Association of Project ECHO Training With Buprenorphine Prescribing by Primary Care Clinicians in Minnesota for Treating Opioid Use Disorder.,"Buprenorphine is an approved medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD); however, prescribing buprenorphine is limited by a requirement to obtain a waiver to prescribe it (hereinafter, ""DATA [Drug Abuse Treatment Act]-waiver"") and a lack of knowledge of the best practices among clinicians. To examine how Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) telementoring is associated with changes in DATA-waiver attainment and buprenorphine prescribing among primary care clinicians in Minnesota. In this retrospective matched-cohort study of 918 clinicians, ECHO-trained clinicians were enrolled on the date they first attended ECHO (January 3, 2018, to June 11, 2020); comparison clinicians were assigned an enrollment date from the distribution of the first ECHO sessions. The baseline period was 12 months preceding enrollment, with follow-up for 18 months or until June 30, 2020. The ECHO-trained clinicians were a population-based sample of primary care clinicians who treated Medicaid patients in Minnesota 12 months prior to the initiation of ECHO training. This analysis used propensity score matching to select comparison clinicians who were similar across demographic and clinical practice characteristics at baseline in a 2:1 ratio. Follow-up was available for 167 ECHO-trained clinicians (54.6%) and 330 comparison clinicians (53.9%) at 18 months. ECHO-trained clinicians attended at least 1 weekly, hour-long ECHO session. Comparison clinicians never participated in any ECHO sessions.

The final sample included 918 clinicians (ECHO-trained [306]; comparison [612]), of whom 620 (67.5%) practiced outside the metropolitan Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St Paul) region. The mean (SD) age of the ECHO-trained clinicians was 46.0 (12.1) years and that of the comparison clinicians was 45.7 (12.3) years. Relative to the changes among the matched comparison clinicians, the ECHO-trained clinicians were more likely to obtain a DATA-waiver (difference-in-differences, 22.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 15.5-29.9 percentage points; P &lt; .001) and prescribe any buprenorphine (16.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.4-22.5 percentage points; P &lt; .001) after 6 quarters of follow-up.

36402275,2023,Design of a pragmatic clinical trial to improve screening and treatment for opioid use disorder in primary care.,"Opioid-related deaths continue to rise in the U.S. A shared decision-making (SDM) system to help primary care clinicians (PCCs) identify and treat patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) could help address this crisis. In this cluster-randomized trial, primary care clinics in three healthcare systems were randomized to receive or not receive access to an OUD-SDM system. The OUD-SDM system alerts PCCs and patients to elevated risk of OUD and supports OUD screening and treatment. It includes guidance on OUD screening and diagnosis, treatment selection, starting and maintaining patients on buprenorphine for waivered clinicians, and screening for common comorbid conditions. The primary study outcome is, of patients at high risk for OUD, the percentage receiving an OUD diagnosis within 30 days of index visit. Additional outcomes are, of patients at high risk for or with a diagnosis of OUD, (a) the percentage receiving a naloxone prescription, or (b) the percentage receiving a medication for OUD (MOUD) prescription or referral to specialty care within 30 days of an index visit, and (c) total days covered by a MOUD prescription within 90 days of an index visit. The intervention started in April 2021 and continues through December 2023. PCCs and patients in 90 clinics are included; study results are expected in 2024. This protocol paper describes the design of a multi-site trial to help PCCs recognize and treat OUD.

36581845,2022,Baseline representativeness of patients in clinics enrolled in the PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) trial: comparison of trial and non-trial clinics in the same health systems.,"Pragmatic primary care trials aim to test interventions in ""real world"" health care settings, but clinics willing and able to participate in trials may not be representative of typical clinics. This analysis compared patients in participating and non-participating clinics from the same health systems at baseline in the PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) trial. This observational analysis relied on secondary electronic health record and administrative claims data in 5 of 6 health systems in the PROUD trial. The sample included patients 16-90 years at an eligible primary care visit in the 3 years before randomization. Each system contributed 2 randomized PROUD trial clinics and 4 similarly sized non-trial clinics. We summarized patient characteristics in trial and non-trial clinics in the 2 years before randomization (""baseline""). Using mixed-effect regression models, we compared trial and non-trial clinics on a baseline measure of the primary trial outcome (clinic-level patient-years of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, scaled per 10,000 primary care patients seen) and a baseline measure of the secondary trial outcome (patient-level days of acute care utilization among patients with OUD). Patients were generally similar between the 10 trial clinics (n = 248,436) and 20 non-trial clinics (n = 341,130), although trial clinics' patients were slightly younger, more likely to be Hispanic/Latinx, less likely to be white, more likely to have Medicaid/subsidized insurance, and lived in less wealthy neighborhoods. Baseline outcomes did not differ between trial and non-trial clinics: trial clinics had 1.0 more patient-year of OUD treatment per 10,000 patients (95% CI: - 2.9, 5.0) and a 4% higher rate of days of acute care utilization than non-trial clinics (rate ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.42). trial clinics and non-trial clinics were similar regarding most measured patient characteristics, and no differences were observed in baseline measures of trial primary and secondary outcomes. These findings suggest trial clinics were representative of comparably sized clinics within the same health systems.

30401680,2019,Long-Lasting Effects of Methocinnamox on Opioid Self-Administration in Rhesus Monkeys.,"Opioid abuse remains a serious public health challenge, despite the availability of medications that are effective in some patients (naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone). This study explored the potential of a pseudoirreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist [methocinnamox (MCAM)] as a treatment for opioid abuse by examining its capacity to attenuate the reinforcing effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists in rhesus monkeys. In one experiment, monkeys responded for heroin (n = 5) or cocaine (n = 4) under a fixed-ratio schedule. Another group (n = 3) worked under a choice procedure with one alternative delivering food and the other alternative delivering the mu-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil. A third group (n = 4) responded for food and physiologic parameters were measured via telemetry. The effects of MCAM were determined in all experiments and, in some cases, were compared with those of naltrexone. When given immediately before sessions, naltrexone dose-dependently decreased responding for heroin and decreased choice of remifentanil while increasing choice of food, with responding returning to baseline levels 1 day after naltrexone injection. MCAM also decreased responding for heroin and decreased choice of remifentanil while increasing choice of food; however, opioid-maintained responding remained decreased for several days after treatment. Doses of MCAM that significantly decreased opioid-maintained responding did not decrease responding for cocaine or food. MCAM did not impact heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, or activity at doses that decreased opioid self-administration. Because MCAM selectively attenuates opioid self-administration for prolonged periods, this novel drug could be a safe and effective alternative to currently available treatments for opioid abuse.","Aftercare;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Blood Pressure;Body Temperature;Buprenorphine;Cinnamates;Cocaine;Drug-Seeking Behavior;Female;Food;Heart Rate;Heroin;Injections;Macaca mulatta;Male;Methadone;Monkeys;Morphine Derivatives;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Public Health;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Remifentanil;Schedules;Self Administration;Telemetry;Therapeutics;Time Factors",Opioid Abuse,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
30463875,2019,Reversal and Prevention of the Respiratory-Depressant Effects of Heroin by the Novel μ-Opioid Receptor Antagonist Methocinnamox in Rhesus Monkeys.,"One consequence of the ongoing opioid epidemic is a large number of overdose deaths. Naloxone reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression; however, its short duration of action limits the protection it can provide. Methocinnamox (MCAM) is a novel opioid receptor antagonist with a long duration of action. This study examined the ability of MCAM to prevent and reverse the respiratory-depressant effects (minute volume [VE]) of heroin in five monkeys. MCAM (0.32 mg/kg) was given before heroin to determine whether it prevents respiratory depression; heroin dose-effect curves were generated 1, 2, 4, and 8 days later, and these effects were compared with those of naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg). Heroin dose dependently decreased VE MCAM and naltrexone prevented respiratory depression, shifting the heroin dose-effect curve rightward at least 10-fold. MCAM, but not naltrexone, attenuated these effects of heroin for 4 days. MCAM (0.1-0.32 mg/kg) was given 30 minutes after heroin to determine whether it reverses respiratory depression; heroin dose-effect curves were generated 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days later, and these effects were compared with those of naloxone (0.0032-0.1 mg/kg). MCAM and naloxone reversed respiratory depression within 30 minutes, although only MCAM antagonized heroin on subsequent days. Thus, MCAM prevents and reverses respiratory depression, the potentially lethal effect of heroin, longer than opioid receptor antagonists currently in use. Because of its sustained effects, MCAM might provide more effective rescue from and protection against the fatal respiratory-depressant effects of opioids, thereby improving treatment of opioid overdose.","Ability;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Cinnamates;Death;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Heroin;Macaca mulatta;Male;Monkeys;Morphine Derivatives;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Therapeutics",Death;Opiate Overdose;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
30997725,2019,Simultaneous quantification of ten key Kratom alkaloids in Mitragyna speciosa leaf extracts and commercial products by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a psychoactive plant popular in the United States for the self-treatment of pain and opioid addiction. For standardization and quality control of raw and commercial kratom products, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of ten key alkaloids, namely: corynantheidine, corynoxine, corynoxine B, 7-hydroxymitragynine, isocorynantheidine, mitragynine, mitraphylline, paynantheine, speciociliatine, and speciogynine. Chromatographic separation of diastereomers, or alkaloids sharing same ion transitions, was achieved on an Acquity BEH C18 column with a gradient elution using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (10mM, pH 3.5). The developed method was linear over a concentration range of 1-200 ng/mL for each alkaloid. The total analysis time per sample was 22.5 minutes. The analytical method was validated for accuracy, precision, robustness, and stability. After successful validation, the method was applied for the quantification of kratom alkaloids in alkaloid-rich fractions, ethanolic extracts, lyophilized teas, and commercial products. Mitragynine (0.7%-38.7% w/w), paynantheine (0.3%-12.8% w/w), speciociliatine (0.4%-12.3% w/w), and speciogynine (0.1%-5.3% w/w) were the major alkaloids in the analyzed kratom products/extracts. Minor kratom alkaloids (corynantheidine, corynoxine, corynoxine B, 7-hydroxymitragynine, isocorynantheidine) were also quantified (0.01%-2.8% w/w) in the analyzed products; however mitraphylline was below the lower limit of quantification in all analyses.","Acetates;Acetonitriles;Alkaloids;Ammonium;Buffers;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Chromatography, Liquid;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Ions;Limit of Detection;Methods;Minors;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Plant Extracts;Plant Leaves;Plants;Quality Control;Self;Separation;Standardization;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Tea;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Drug Test Anal,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
31098655,2019,The effects of mitragynine and morphine on schedule-controlled responding and antinociception in rats.,"Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) may hold promise as both an analgesic and treatment for opioid use disorder. Mitragynine, its primary alkaloid constituent, is an opioid receptor ligand. However, the extent to which the in vivo effects of mitragynine are mediated by opioid receptors, or whether mitragynine interacts with other opioid agonists, is not fully established. The effects of mitragynine and the prototypical opioid agonist morphine were compared for their capacity to decrease operant responding for food delivery, and to increase response latency to a thermal stimulus. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats responded under a multiple cycle fixed ratio 10 schedule of food delivery and were tested on a hot plate (52 °C) immediately after each cycle. Morphine and mitragynine were administered alone, in combination with each other, and in combination with the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Morphine and mitragynine dose-dependently decreased schedule-controlled responding; the ED50 values were 7.3 and 31.5 mg/kg, respectively. Both drugs increased thermal antinociception; the ED50 value for morphine was 18.3. Further, doses of naltrexone that antagonized morphine did not antagonize mitragynine. Mitragynine (17.8 mg/kg) did not alter the rate-decreasing or antinociceptive effects of morphine. The antinociceptive effects of mitragynine and morphine occur at doses larger than those that disrupt learned behavior. Opioid receptors do not appear to mediate the disruptive effects of mitragynine on learned behavior. Mitragynine had lesser antinociceptive effects than morphine, and these did not appear to be mediated by opioid receptors. The pharmacology of mitragynine includes a substantial non-opioid mechanism.","Alkaloids;Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior;Discrimination Learning;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Food;Ligands;Male;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Morphine;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Response Latency;Rodentia;Schedules;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Pain,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
31439807,2019,Methocinnamox Produces Long-Lasting Antagonism of the Behavioral Effects of µ-Opioid Receptor Agonists but Not Prolonged Precipitated Withdrawal in Rats.,"A novel µ-opioid receptor antagonist, methocinnamox (MCAM), attenuates some abuse-related and toxic effects of opioids. This study further characterized the pharmacology of MCAM in separate groups of rats using procedures to examine antinociception, gastrointestinal motility, and withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats. Antinociceptive effects of opioid receptor agonists were measured before and after MCAM (1-10 mg/kg) using warm water tail withdrawal and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation in inflamed paws (complete Freund's adjuvant). Before MCAM, morphine, fentanyl, and the κ-opioid receptor agonist spiradoline dose dependently increased tail-withdrawal latency from 50°C water; MCAM attenuated the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl, but not spiradoline. Morphine increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation and decreased gastrointestinal motility, and MCAM blocked both effects. These antagonist effects of 10 mg/kg MCAM were persistent, lasting for 2 weeks or longer. Withdrawal emerged after discontinuation of morphine treatment or administration of 10 mg/kg MCAM or 17.8 mg/kg naloxone; other than the day of antagonist administration when withdrawal signs were greater in rats that received antagonist compared with rats that received vehicle, there was no difference among groups in directly observable withdrawal signs or decreased body weight. These results confirm that MCAM is a selective µ-opioid receptor antagonist with an exceptionally long duration of action, likely due to pseudoirreversible binding. Despite its sustained antagonist effects, the duration of withdrawal precipitated by MCAM is not different from that precipitated by naloxone, suggesting that the long duration of antagonism provided by MCAM could be particularly effective for treating opioid abuse and overdose. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The opioid receptor antagonist MCAM attenuates some abuse-related and toxic effects of opioids. This study demonstrates that MCAM selectively antagonizes multiple effects mediated by µ-opioid receptor agonists for 2 weeks or longer, and like naloxone, MCAM precipitates withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats. Despite this persistent antagonism, withdrawal signs precipitated by MCAM are not significantly different from signs precipitated by naloxone or occurring after discontinuation of morphine, suggesting that using MCAM for opioid abuse or overdose would not produce sustained withdrawal.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Body Weight;Cinnamates;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Fentanyl;Freund's Adjuvant;Gastrointestinal Motility;Male;Morphine;Morphine Derivatives;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Pain Measurement;Pharmacology;Procedures;Random Allocation;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Sensitivity;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Tail;Therapeutics;Water",Opioid Abuse;Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
31743739,2019,"Pharmacological characterization of 17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-epoxy-6-[(3'-fluoro-4'-pyridyl)acetamido]morphinan (NFP) as a dual selective MOR/KOR ligand with potential applications in treating opioid use disorder.","For thousands of years opioids have been the first-line treatment option for pain management. However, the tolerance and addiction potential of opioids limit their applications in clinic. NFP, a MOR/KOR dual-selective opioid antagonist, was identified as a ligand that significantly antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with lesser withdrawal effects than naloxone at similar doses. To validate the potential application of NFP in opioid addiction treatment, a series of in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to further characterize its pharmacological profile. In calcium mobilization assays and MOR internalization studies, NFP showed the apparent capacity to antagonize DAMGO-induced calcium flux and etorphine-induced MOR internalization. In contrast to the opioid agonists DAMGO and morphine, cells pretreated with NFP did not show apparent desensitization and down regulation of the MOR. Though in vitro bidirectional transport studies showed that NFP might be a P-gp substrate, in warm-water tail-withdrawal assays it was able to antagonize the antinociceptive effects of morphine indicating its potential central nervous system activity. Overall these results suggest that NFP is a promising dual selective opioid antagonist that may have the potential to be used therapeutically in opioid use disorder treatment.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Biological Transport;CHO Cells;Caco-2 Cells;Calcium;Cell Line, Tumor;Cells;Central Nervous System;Cricetulus;Down-Regulation;Drug Abuse;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Etorphine;Humans;In Vitro;Ligands;Male;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Morphinans;Morphine;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain Management;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Tail;Therapeutics;Water",Drug Abuse;Neoplasms;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Eur J Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

31932466,2021,Medications Development for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.,"This review describes methods for preclinical evaluation of candidate medications to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). The review is founded on the propositions that (1) drug self-administration procedures provide the most direct method for assessment of medication effectiveness, (2) procedures that assess choice between opioid and nondrug reinforcers are especially useful, and (3) states of opioid dependence and withdrawal profoundly influence both opioid reinforcement and effects of candidate medications. Effects of opioid medications and vaccines on opioid choice in nondependent and opioid-dependent subjects are reviewed. Various nonopioid medications have also been examined, but none yet have been identified that safely and reliably reduce opioid choice. Future research will focus on (1) strategies for increasing safety and/or effectiveness of opioid medications (e.g., G-protein-biased μ-opioid agonists), and (2) continued development of nonopioid medications (e.g., clonidine) that might serve as adjunctive agents to current opioid medications.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Choice Behavior;Clonidine;Drug Development;Evidence-Based Medicine;Future;GTP-Binding Proteins;Humans;Methadone;Methods;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Narcotics;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Research;Review;Safety;Self Administration;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Vaccines",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32003816,2020,Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women via Telemedicine: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,"There are high rates of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality associated with opioid use disorder (OUD). Integrating OUD treatment in obstetric practices for pregnant and postpartum women via telemedicine can increase access to care and reduce the consequences of OUD. Evaluation of this care delivery model, however, is needed before widespread adoption. To compare maternal and newborn outcomes among pregnant women with OUD receiving care via telemedicine vs in person. A nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 women receiving perinatal OUD treatment in 4 outpatient obstetric practices by telemedicine or in person and followed up until 6 to 8 weeks post partum was conducted from September 4, 2017, to December 31, 2018. Logistic regression with propensity score adjustment was applied to reduce group selection bias and control for potentially confounding variables. Participants were seen weekly for 4 weeks, every 2 weeks for 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter and provided relapse prevention therapy and buprenorphine. The outcomes were retention in treatment, defined as uninterrupted addiction treatment during pregnancy through 6 to 8 weeks post partum; urine drug screen results at delivery and 6 to 8 weeks post partum; and a neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) diagnosis collected via electronic health records. The mean (SD) age of the 98 pregnant women was 30.23 (5.12) years. Of these, 41 of 44 women (93.2%) in the telemedicine group and 48 of 54 women (88.9%) in the in-person group chose to continue treatment in the program after an initial evaluation. After propensity score weighting and doubly robust estimation, no significant differences were found between groups in retention in treatment at 6 to 8 weeks post partum (telemedicine: 80.4% vs in person: 92.7%; treatment effect, -12.2%; 95% CI, -32.3% to -4.4%). Similarly, after propensity score weighting and doubly robust estimation, there were no significant group differences in rates of NAS (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 63.2%; treatment effect, -17.8%; 95% CI, -41.0% to 8.9%). In this nonrandomized controlled trial, virtually integrated OUD care in obstetric practices produced similar maternal and newborn outcomes compared with in-person care. These findings may have important public health implications for combatting the opioid crisis and its consequences on pregnant women and their families. Future large randomized clinical trials are needed.

This study examined effects of acute and repeated MCAM administration on self-administration of the high-efficacy mu opioid receptor agonist fentanyl and characterized MCAM pharmacokinetics. Four rhesus monkeys self-administered i.v. infusions of fentanyl (0.00032 mg/kg/infusion) or cocaine (0.032 mg/kg/infusion). MCAM (0.1-0.32 mg/kg) or the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (0.001-0.032 mg/kg) was injected prior to test sessions to evaluate acute effects. On a separate occasion, 0.32 mg/kg MCAM was injected every 12 days for 5 total injections to evaluate the effectiveness of repeated treatment. Following acute injection, MCAM and naltrexone decreased fentanyl self-administration on the day of treatment, with attenuation lasting for up to 2 weeks after the larger MCAM dose and &lt;1 day after naltrexone. Repeated MCAM administration decreased fentanyl self-administration for more than 2 months without altering cocaine self-administration. MCAM plasma concentrations peaked 15-45 min after injection, with a half-life ranging from 13.7 to 199.8 min, and decreased markedly 1 day after injection. MCAM selectively reduced opioid self-administration and remained effective with repeated administration. Moreover, MCAM was effective at times when plasma levels were very low, suggesting that pharmacodynamic (i.e., pseudoirreversible binding to mu opioid receptors) and not pharmacokinetic factors play a significant role in its long-lasting effects. Taken together with previous studies, these data indicate that MCAM could be a safe, effective, and long-acting treatment for OUD.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Cinnamates;Cocaine;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Fentanyl;Half-Life;Heroin;Injections;Macaca mulatta;Morphine Derivatives;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pharmacokinetics;Plasma;Play;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Self;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder,Neuropsychopharmacology,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32424771,2021,Synthesis and Characterization of Azido Aryl Analogs of IBNtxA for Radio-Photoaffinity Labeling Opioid Receptors in Cell Lines and in Mouse Brain.,"Mu opioid receptors (MOR-1) mediate the biological actions of clinically used opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. The mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative splicing, generating multiple splice variants. One type of splice variants are truncated variants containing only six transmembrane domains (6TM) that mediate the analgesic action of novel opioid drugs such as 3'-iodobenzoylnaltrexamide (IBNtxA). Previously, we have shown that IBNtxA is a potent analgesic effective in a spectrum of pain models but lacks many side-effects associated with traditional opiates. In order to investigate the targets labeled by IBNtxA, we synthesized two arylazido analogs of IBNtxA that allow photolabeling of mouse mu opioid receptors (mMOR-1) in transfected cell lines and mMOR-1 protein complexes that may comprise the 6TM sites in mouse brain. We demonstrate that both allyl and alkyne arylazido derivatives of IBNtxA efficiently radio-photolabeled mMOR-1 in cell lines and MOR-1 protein complexes expressed either exogenously or endogenously, as well as found in mouse brain. In future, design and application of such radio-photolabeling ligands with a conjugated handle will provide useful tools for further isolating or purifying MOR-1 to investigate site specific ligand-protein contacts and its signaling complexes.","Alkynes;Alternative Splicing;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Azides;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;CHO Cells;Cell Line;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Fentanyl;Future;Genes;Ligands;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Morphine;Naltrexone;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Photoaffinity Labels;Protein Binding;Proteins;Radio;Radioligand Assay;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu",Pain,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32439536,2020,Impaired mesocorticolimbic connectivity underlies increased pain sensitivity in chronic low back pain.,"Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a prevalent disorder. A growing body of evidence linking the pathology of the reward network to chronic pain suggests that pain sensitization may contribute to cLBP chronification via disruptions of mesocortical and mesolimbic circuits in the reward system. Resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired from 90 patients with cLBP and 74 matched pain-free controls (HCs) at baseline and after a manipulation for back pain intensification. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) was chosen as a seed region to perform RS functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Baseline rsFC of both the mesocortical (between the VTA and bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)/and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) and mesolimbic (between the VTA and bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus) pathways was reduced in patients with cLBP (vs. HCs). In addition, patients exhibiting higher back pain intensity (compared to the relatively lower back pain intensity condition) also showed increases in both mesocortical and mesolimbic connectivity, implicating these pathways in pain downregulation in cLBP. Mediation analysis further isolated the mesolimbic (VTA-hippocampus/parahippocampus) dysconnectivity as a neural mechanism mediating the association between mechanical pain sensitivity (indexed by P40 pressure) and cLBP severity. In sum, the current study demonstrates deficient mesocorticolimbic connectivity in cLBP, with mesolimbic dysconnectivity potentially mediating the contribution of pain sensitization to pain chronification. These reward network dysfunctions and purportedly, dopaminergic dysregulations, may help us to identify key brain targets of neuromodulation in the treatment of cLBP.",Adult;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Association;Back Pain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chronic Pain;Down-Regulation;Female;Hippocampus;Humans;Low Back Pain;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Mediating;Mediation Analysis;Neural Pathways;Pain;Pain Threshold;Pathology;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Pressure;Reward;Seeds;Sensitivity;Therapeutics;Ventral Tegmental Area;fMRI,Back Pain;Chronic Pain;Low Back Pain;Pain,Neuroimage,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32440644,2020,Developing Improved Translational Models of Pain: A Role for the Behavioral Scientist.,"The effective management of pain is a longstanding public health concern. Although opioids have been frontline analgesics for decades, they also have well-known undesirable effects that limit their clinical utility, such as abuse liability and respiratory depression. The failure to develop better analgesics has, in some ways, contributed to the escalating opioid epidemic that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and has cost hundreds of billions of dollars in health-care expenses. A paradigm shift is needed in the pharmacotherapy of pain management that will require extensive efforts throughout biomedical science. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the critical role of the behavioral scientist to devise improved translational models of pain for drug development. Despite high heterogeneity of painful conditions that involve cortical-dependent pain processing, current models often feature an overreliance on simple reflex-based measures and an emphasis on the absence, rather than presence, of behavior as evidence of analgesic efficacy. Novel approaches should focus on the restoration of operant and other CNS-mediated behavior under painful conditions.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Behavior;Cost;Drug Development;Drug Therapy;Health Care;Measures;Models, Animal;Nociception;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Public Health;Reflex;Respiratory Depression;Review;Role;Science",Pain;Respiratory Depression,Perspect Behav Sci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Acupuncture has emerged as a promising method for treating cLBP. However, the mechanism underlying acupuncture remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the modulation effects of acupuncture on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in patients with cLBP. Seventy-nine cLBP patients were recruited and assigned to four weeks of real or sham acupuncture. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before the first and after the last treatment. Fifty patients completed the study. We found remission of pain bothersomeness in all treatment groups after four weeks, with greater pain relief after real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture. We also found that real acupuncture can increase VTA/PAG rsFC with the amygdala, and the increased rsFC was associated with decreased pain bothersomeness scores. Baseline PAG-amygdala rsFC could predict four-week treatment response. Our results suggest that acupuncture may simultaneously modulate the rsFC of key regions in the descending pain modulation (PAG) and reward systems (VTA), and the amygdala may be a key node linking the two systems to produce antinociceptive effects.

32682992,2020,Characterizing the analgesic effects of real and imagined acupuncture using functional and structure MRI.,"Acupuncture and imagery interventions for pain management have a long history. The present study comparatively investigated whether acupuncture and video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT, watching a video of acupuncture on the participant's own body while imagining it being applied) could modulate brain regional connectivity to produce analgesic effects. The study also examined whether pre-intervention brain functional and structural features could be used to predict the magnitude of analgesic effects. Twenty-four healthy participants were recruited and received four different interventions (real acupuncture, sham acupuncture, VGAIT, and VGAIT control) in random order using a cross-over design. Pain thresholds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected before and after each intervention. We first compared the modulatory effects of real acupuncture and VGAIT on intra- and inter-regional intrinsic brain connectivity and found that real acupuncture decreased regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) in sensorimotor areas, whereas VGAIT increased ReHo in basal ganglia (BG) (i.e., putamen) and FC between the BG subcortical network and default mode network. The altered ReHo and FC were associated with changes in pain threshold after real acupuncture and VGAIT, respectively. A multimodality fusion approach with pre-intervention ReHo and gray matter volume (GMV) as features was used to explore the brain profiles underlying individual variability of pain threshold changes by real acupuncture and VGAIT. Variability in acupuncture responses was associated with ReHo and GMV in BG, whereas VGAIT responses were associated with ReHo and GMV in the anterior insula. These results suggest that, through different pathways, both real acupuncture and VGAIT can modulate brain systems to produce analgesic effects.",Acupuncture;Acupuncture Therapy;Adult;Analgesia;Analgesics;Basal Ganglia;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Connectome;Cross-Over Design;Default Mode Network;Gray Matter;Healthy Volunteers;History;Humans;Imagination;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Nerve Net;Pain Management;Pain Perception;Pain Threshold;Putamen;Sensorimotor Cortex;Therapeutics,Pain,Neuroimage,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32684925,2020,Imagined and Actual Acupuncture Effects on Chronic Low Back Pain: A Preliminary Study.,"Research suggests that imagined experiences can produce brain responses similar to those produced by actual experiences. Shared brain responses that support both imagination and perception may underlie the functional nature of mental imagery. In a previous study, we combined acupuncture and imagery to develop a new treatment method, video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT). We found that VGAIT significantly increased pain thresholds in healthy subjects. The aim of this study is to extend our previous finding by investigating whether VGAIT can relieve symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain. We first performed a single-arm study in which we administered video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT) on patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) (Study 1, n = 18, 12 females). We then compared our findings to those from a recently published study in which real or sham acupuncture treatment was applied on patients with cLBP (Study 2, n = 50, 31 females) using a similar protocol. All patients in Studies 1 and 2 received 6 treatments over 4 weeks. All three treatments (VGAIT, real, and sham acupuncture) significantly reduced pain severity as measured by a low back pain bothersomeness score. VGAIT produced similar effects to real acupuncture (p = 0.97) and nonsignificantly greater pain bothersomeness relief compared to sham acupuncture (p = 0.14). Additional analysis showed that there was no significant difference on the sensations evoked by different treatment modalities. These findings support VGAIT as a promising method for pain management.","Acupuncture;Acupuncture Therapy;Adult;Arm;Brain;Chronic Pain;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Imagery, Psychotherapy;Imagination;Low Back Pain;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Nature;News;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Pain Threshold;Patients;Perception;Research;Sensation;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Chronic Pain;Low Back Pain;Pain,Neural Plast,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32693425,2020,Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Mitragynine in Beagle Dogs.,"Mitragynine is the most abundant psychoactive alkaloid derived from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa (kratom), a tropical plant indigenous to regions of Southeast Asia. Mitragynine displays a moderate affinity to opioid receptors, and kratom is often self-prescribed to treat pain and/or opioid addiction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of mitragynine in the dog. Single dose oral (5 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.1 mg/kg) pharmacokinetic studies of mitragynine were performed in female beagle dogs. The plasma concentrations of mitragynine were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer, and the pharmacokinetic properties were analyzed using non-compartmental analysis. Following intravenous administration, mitragynine showed a large volume of distribution (Vd, 6.3 ± 0.6 L/kg) and high clearance (Cl, 1.8 ± 0.4 L/h/kg). Following oral mitragynine dosing, first peak plasma (Cmax, 278.0 ± 47.4 ng/mL) concentrations were observed within 0.5 h. A potent mu-opioid receptor agonist and active metabolite of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, was also observed with a Cmax of 31.5 ± 3.3 ng/mL and a Tmax of 1.7 ± 0.6 h in orally dosed dogs while its plasma concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification (1 ng/mL) for the intravenous study. The absolute oral bioavailability of mitragynine was 69.6%. Administration of mitragynine was well tolerated, although mild sedation and anxiolytic effects were observed. These results provide the first detailed pharmacokinetic information for mitragynine in a non-rodent species (the dog) and therefore also provide significant information for allometric scaling and dose predictions when designing clinical studies.","Administration;Administration, Intravenous;Alkaloids;Animals;Anti-Anxiety Effect;Asia, Southeastern;Biological Availability;Chromatography, Liquid;Clinical Study;Dogs;Female;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pharmacokinetics;Plant Extracts;Plant Leaves;Plants;Plasma;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Rodentia;Safety;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Self",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Planta Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32772146,2020,Methocinnamox (MCAM) antagonizes the behavioral suppressant effects of morphine without impairing delayed matching-to-sample accuracy in rhesus monkeys.,"Opioid abuse remains a serious public health problem. The pseudoirreversible mu opioid receptor antagonist methocinnamox (MCAM) might be useful for treating opioid abuse and overdose. Because endogenous opioid systems can modulate cognition and decision-making, it is important to evaluate whether long-term blockade of mu opioid receptors by MCAM adversely impacts complex operant behavior involving memory. This study tested the effects of MCAM in rhesus monkeys responding under a delayed matching-to-sample task, with correct responses reinforced by sucrose pellets. Because MCAM did not alter performance, antagonism of the rate-decreasing effects of morphine was used to confirm that an effective dose of MCAM was administered. Moreover, the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist phencyclidine were studied as positive controls to demonstrate sensitivity of this procedure to memory disruption. Neither MCAM (0.32 mg/kg) nor morphine (1-5.6 mg/kg) impaired delayed matching-to-sample accuracy. Morphine dose-dependently decreased the number of trials completed before MCAM administration, and a single injection of MCAM blocked the behavioral suppressant effects of morphine for at least 7 days. Scopolamine (0.01-0.056 mg/kg) and phencyclidine (0.1-0.56 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased delayed matching-to-sample accuracy and the number of trials completed. MCAM did not impair memory (as measured by accuracy in a delayed matching-to-sample task) and did not decrease responding for or consumption of sucrose pellets. This dose of MCAM attenuates self-administration of opioids and reverses as well as prevents opioid-induced respiratory depression. These results provide further support for a favorable adverse effect profile for MCAM.","Administration;Animals;Behavior;Cinnamates;Cognition;Consumption;Decision Making;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Injections;Macaca mulatta;Male;Memory;Morphine;Morphine Derivatives;N-Methylaspartate;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Phencyclidine;Procedures;Public Health;Receptors, Muscarinic;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Reinforcement, Psychology;Respiratory Depression;Scopolamine Derivatives;Self Administration;Sensitivity;Sucrose",Opioid Abuse;Respiratory Depression,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32889450,2020,Evaluation of the rewarding effects of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in an intracranial self-stimulation procedure in male and female rats.,"Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) has been used in Southeast Asia for hundreds of years to increase energy, for relaxation, and to diminish opioid withdrawal. Kratom use has recently spread to Western countries. Kratom could potentially be used for the treatment of opioid withdrawal and pain, but more insight is needed into its abuse potential. Therefore, we investigated the rewarding properties of the primary kratom alkaloid mitragynine and its active metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine, and morphine as a reference drug in male and female rats. These compounds have agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors. The compounds were tested in an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure, which allows for the evaluation of the rewarding/aversive and sedative effects of drugs. Rewarding doses of drugs decrease the brain reward thresholds, and aversive drug doses have the opposite effect. Mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and morphine affected the brain reward thresholds. A high dose of 7-hydroxymitragynine (3.2 mg/kg) increased the brain reward thresholds, whereas an intermediate dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) decreased the reward thresholds. 7-Hydroxymitragynine and morphine affected the response latencies. Five mg/kg of morphine increased response latencies. 7-Hydroxymitragynine tended to increase the response latencies, but the post hoc analyses did not reveal a significant effect. There were no sex differences in the effects of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and morphine on the reward thresholds and the response latencies. These initial findings indicate that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are not rewarding in the ICSS procedure. The present results suggest that these kratom alkaloids do not have abuse potential.","Alkaloids;Animals;Asia, Southeastern;Brain;Female;Male;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Morphine;Narcotics;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plant Extracts;Procedures;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Relaxation;Response Latency;Reward;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Sedative Effect;Self Stimulation;Sex Characteristics;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics",Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
32897695,2020,"Comparison of Pharmacological Properties between the Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonist Nalfurafine and 42B, Its 3-Dehydroxy Analogue: Disconnect between in Vitro Agonist Bias and in Vivo Pharmacological Effects.","Nalfurafine, a moderately selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist, is used in Japan for treatment of itch without causing dysphoria or psychotomimesis. Here we characterized the pharmacology of compound 42B, a 3-dehydroxy analogue of nalfurafine and compared with that of nalfurafine. Nalfurafine and 42B acted as full KOR agonists and partial μ opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, but 42B showed much lower potency for both receptors and lower KOR/MOR selectivity, different from previous reports. Molecular modeling revealed that water-mediated hydrogen-bond formation between 3-OH of nalfurafine and KOR accounted for its higher KOR potency than 42B. The higher potency of both at KOR over MOR may be due to hydrogen-bond formation between nonconserved Y7.35 of KOR and their carbonyl groups. Both showed modest G protein signaling biases. In mice, like nalfurafine, 42B produced antinociceptive and antiscratch effects and did not cause conditioned place aversion (CPA) in the effective dose ranges. Unlike nalfurafine, 42B caused motor incoordination and hypolocomotion. As both agonists showed G protein biases, yet produced different effects on locomotor activity and motor incoordination, the findings and those in the literature suggest caution in correlating in vitro biochemical data with in vivo behavior effects. The factors contributing to the disconnect, including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic issues, are discussed. In addition, our results suggest that among the KOR-induced adverse behaviors, CPA can be separated from motor incoordination and hypolocomotion.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Antipruritics;Behavior;Bias;Dyscoordination;GTP-Binding Proteins;Hydrogen Bonds;In Vitro;Japan;Literature;Locomotion;Mice;Morphinans;Pharmacokinetics;Pharmacology;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Report;Separated;Spiro Compounds;Therapeutics;Water",Dyscoordination,ACS Chem Neurosci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Classical pain management is achieved through the use of opiates belonging to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) class, which have significant side effects that hinder their utility. Pharmacologists have been trying to develop opioids devoid of side effects since the isolation of morphine from papaver somniferum, more commonly known as opium by Sertürner in 1804. The natural products salvinorin A, mitragynine, and collybolide represent three nonmorphinan natural product-based targets, which are potent selective agonists of opioid receptors, and emerging next-generation analgesics.

33007552,2020,Preparation and evaluation of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors with improved physical properties and potencies for treating diabetic neuropathic pain.,"Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a novel therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, is a largely cytosolic enzyme that degrades epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs), an important class of lipid signaling molecules. Many inhibitors of sEH have been reported, and to date, the 1,3-disubstituted urea has the highest affinity reported for the sEH among the central pharmacophores evaluated. An earlier somewhat water soluble sEH inhibitor taken to the clinic for blood pressure control had mediocre potency (both affinity and kinetics) and a short in vivo half-life. We undertook a study to overcome these difficulties, but the sEH inhibitors carrying a 1,3-disubstituted urea often suffer poor physical properties that hinder their formulation. In this report, we described new strategies to improve the physical properties of sEH inhibitors with a 1,3-disubstituted urea while maintaining their potency and drug-target residence time (a complementary in vitro parameter) against sEH. To our surprise, we identified two structural modifications that substantially improve the potency and physical properties of sEH inhibitors carrying a 1,3-disubstituted urea pharmacophore. Such improvements will greatly facilitate the movement of sEH inhibitors to the clinic.","Animals;Blood Pressure;Carrying;Dates;Diabetic Neuropathies;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Design;Enzyme Inhibitors;Enzymes;Epoxide Hydrolases;Fatty Acids;Half-Life;Humans;Hypoglycemic Agents;In Vitro;Kinetics;Lipids;Mice;Molecular Docking Simulation;Molecular Structure;Movement;Neuralgia;News;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Report;Solubility;Structure-Activity Relationship;Therapeutics;Time;Urea;Water",Diabetic Neuropathies;Neuralgia,Bioorg Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33031872,2021,Use of home cage wheel running to assess the behavioural effects of administering a mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer antagonist for spontaneous morphine withdrawal in the rat.,"Opioid abuse is a major health problem. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potentially disruptive side effects and therapeutic potential of a novel antagonist (D24M) of the mu-/delta-opioid receptor (MOR/DOR) heterodimer in male rats. Administration of high doses of D24M (1 &amp; 10 nmol) into the lateral ventricle did not disrupt home cage wheel running. Repeated twice daily administration of increasing doses of morphine (5-20 mg/kg) over 5 days depressed wheel running and induced antinociceptive tolerance measured with the hot plate test. Administration of D24M had no effect on morphine tolerance, but tended to prolong morphine antinociception in non-tolerant rats. Spontaneous morphine withdrawal was evident as a decrease in body weight, a reduction in wheel running and an increase in sleep during the normally active dark phase of the circadian cycle, and an increase in wheel running and wakefulness in the normally inactive light phase. Administration of D24M during the dark phase on the third day of withdrawal had no effect on wheel running. These data provide additional evidence for the clinical relevance of home cage wheel running as a method to assess spontaneous opioid withdrawal in rats. These data also demonstrate that blocking the MOR/DOR heterodimer does not produce disruptive side effects or block the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Although administration of D24M had no effect on morphine withdrawal, additional studies are needed to evaluate withdrawal to continuous morphine administration and other opioids in rats with persistent pain.","Administration;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Body Weight;Disease Models, Animal;Health;Lateral Ventricles;Light;Male;Methods;Morphine;Narcotic Antagonists;Narcotics;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Pain;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Running;Sleep;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Wakefulness",Opioid Abuse;Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Behav Brain Res,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33033993,2021,"Mu Opioids Induce Biased Signaling at the Full-Length Seven Transmembrane C-Terminal Splice Variants of the mu Opioid Receptor Gene, Oprm1.","The biased signaling has been extensively studied in the original mu opioid receptor (MOR-1), particularly through G protein and β-arrestin2 signaling pathways. The concept that the G protein pathway is often linked to the therapeutic effect of the drug, while the β-arrestin pathway is associated to the side effects has been proposed to develop biased analgesic compounds with limited side-effects associated with traditional opiates. The mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing, generating multiple splice variants or isoforms that are conserved from rodent to human. One type of the Oprm1 splice variants are the full-length 7 transmembrane (7TM) C-terminal splice variants, which have identical receptor structures including entire binding pocket, but contain a different intracellular C-terminal tail resulted from 3' alternative splicing. Increasing evidence suggest that these full-length 7TM C-terminal variants play important roles in mu opioid pharmacology, raising questions regarding biased signaling at these multiple C-terminal variants. In the present study, we investigated the effect of different C-terminal variants on mu agonist-induced G protein coupling, β-arrestin2 recruitment, and ultimately, signaling bias. We found that mu agonists produced marked differences in G protein activation and β-arrestin2 recruitment among various C-terminal variants, leading to biased signaling at various level. Particularly, MOR-1O, an exon 7-associated variant, showed greater β-arrestin2 bias for most mu agonists than MOR-1, an exon 4-associated variant. Biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors has been defined by evidences that different agonists can produce divergent signaling transduction pathways through a single receptor. Our findings that a single mu agonist can induce differential signaling through multiple 7TM splice variants provide a new perspective on biased signaling at least for Oprm1, which perhaps is important for our understanding of the complex mu opioid actions in vivo where all the 7TM splice variants co-exist.","Alternative Splicing;Amino Acid Sequence;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Bias;CHO Cells;Comprehension;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Exons;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate);HEK293 Cells;Humans;Naltrexone;News;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Play;Protein Binding;Protein Isoforms;RNA, Messenger, Precursors;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Rodentia;Role;Signal Transduction;Tail;Therapeutic Effects;beta-Arrestin 2;beta-Arrestins",,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33079736,2021,'Reinventing the wheel' to advance the development of pain therapeutics.,"Chronic pain affects approximately one-third of the population worldwide. The primary goal of animal research is to understand the neural mechanisms underlying pain so better treatments can be developed. Despite an enormous investment in time and money, almost no novel treatments for pain have been developed. There are many factors that contribute to this lack of translation in drug development. The mismatch between the goals of drug development in animals (inhibition of pain-evoked responses) and treatment in humans (restoration of function) is a major problem. To solve this problem, a number of pain-depressed behavioral tests have been developed to assess changes in normal behavior in laboratory animals. The use of home cage wheel running as a pain assessment tool is especially useful in that it is easy to use, provides an objective measurement of the magnitude and duration of pain, and is a clinically relevant method to screen novel drugs. Pain depresses activity in humans and animals, and effective analgesic treatments restore activity. Unlike traditional pain-evoked tests (e.g., hot plate, tail flick, von Frey test), restoration of home cage wheel running evaluates treatments for both antinociceptive efficacy and the absence of disruptive side effects (e.g., sedation, paralysis, nausea). This article reviews the literature using wheel running to assess pain and makes the case for home cage wheel running as an effective and clinically relevant method to screen novel analgesics for therapeutic potential.","Affect;Analgesics;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Animals, Laboratory;Behavior;Behavior Test;Behavior, Animal;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Drug Development;Goals;Humans;Investments;Literature;Methods;Nausea;Pain;Pain Measurement;Paralysis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Review;Running;Tail;Therapeutics;Time;Translations",Chronic Pain;Nausea;Pain;Paralysis,Behav Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

33113208,2021,Countermeasures for Preventing and Treating Opioid Overdose.,"The only medication available currently to prevent and treat opioid overdose (naloxone) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nearly 50 years ago. Because of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, naloxone has limited utility under some conditions and would not be effective to counteract mass casualties involving large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids. To address shortcomings of current medical countermeasures for opioid toxicity, a trans-agency scientific meeting was convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH) on August 6 and 7, 2019, to explore emerging alternative approaches for treating opioid overdose in the event of weaponization of synthetic opioids. The meeting was initiated by the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP), was organized by NIAID, and was a collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH (NIDA/NIH), the FDA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This paper provides an overview of several presentations at that meeting that discussed emerging new approaches for treating opioid overdose, including the following: (1) intranasal nalmefene, a competitive, reversible opioid receptor antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone; (2) methocinnamox, a novel opioid receptor antagonist; (3) covalent naloxone nanoparticles; (4) serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonists; (5) fentanyl-binding cyclodextrin scaffolds; (6) detoxifying biomimetic ""nanosponge"" decoy receptors; and (7) antibody-based strategies.

Over 100 million adults in the U.S. suffer from intermittent or constant chronic pain, and chronic pain affects at least 10% of the world's population. The primary pharmaceuticals for treatment of chronic pain have been natural or synthetic opioids and the use of opioids for pain treatment has resulted in what has been called an ""epidemic"" of opioid abuse, addiction and lethal overdoses. We have, through a process of rational drug design, generated a novel chemical entity (NCE) and have given it the name Kindolor. Kindolor is a non-opiate, non-addicting molecule that was developed specifically to simultaneously control the aberrant activity of three targets on the peripheral sensory system that are integral in the development and propagation of chronic pain. In our initial preclinical studies, we demonstrated the efficacy of Kindolor to reduce or eliminate chronic pain in five animal models. The overall goal of the project is to complete the investigational new drug (IND)-enabling preclinical studies of Kindolor, and once IND approval is gained, we will proceed to the clinical Phase Ia and 1b safety studies and a Phase 2a efficacy study.

33170687,2020,Synthesis and Pharmacology of a Novel μ-δ Opioid Receptor Heteromer-Selective Agonist Based on the Carfentanyl Template.,"In this work, we studied a series of carfentanyl amide-based opioid derivatives targeting the mu opioid receptor (μOR) and the delta opioid receptor (δOR) heteromer as a credible novel target in pain management therapy. We identified a lead compound named MP135 that exhibits high G-protein activity at μ-δ heteromers compared to the homomeric δOR or μOR and low β-arrestin2 recruitment activity at all three. Furthermore, MP135 exhibits distinct signaling profile, as compared to the previously identified agonist targeting μ-δ heteromers, CYM51010. Pharmacological characterization of MP135 supports the utility of this compound as a molecule that could be developed as an antinociceptive agent similar to morphine in rodents. In vivo characterization reveals that MP135 maintains untoward side effects such as respiratory depression and reward behavior; together, these results suggest that optimization of MP135 is necessary for the development of therapeutics that suppress the classical side effects associated with conventional clinical opioids.","Amides;Analgesics;Animals;Antinociceptive Agents;Behavior;Cell Line;Exhibition;Fentanyl;GTP-Binding Proteins;Humans;Lead;Male;Mice;Mice, 129 Strain;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Morphine;Opioids;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Pharmacology;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Recruitment Activities;Respiratory Depression;Reward;Rodentia;Therapeutics;Work;beta-Arrestin 2",Pain;Respiratory Depression,J Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Vaccines offer a promising strategy to reduce the prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUDs) and to prevent toxicity from accidental and deliberate exposure to fentanyl and its derivatives. This study describes the development and characterization of vaccine formulations consisting of novel fentanyl-based haptens conjugated to carrier proteins. Vaccine efficacy was tested against opioid-induced behavior and toxicity in mice and rats challenged with fentanyl and its analogues. Prophylactic vaccination reduced fentanyl- and sufentanil-induced antinociception, respiratory depression, and bradycardia in mice and rats. Therapeutic vaccination also reduced fentanyl intravenous self-administration in rats. Because of their selectivity, vaccines did not interfere with the pharmacological effects of commonly used anesthetics nor with methadone, naloxone, oxycodone, or heroin. These preclinical data support the translation of vaccines as a viable strategy to counteract fentanyl use disorders and toxicity.","Anesthetics;Animals;Bacterial Proteins;Behavior;Bradycardia;Carrier Proteins;Cattle;Diphtheria Toxin;Female;Fentanyl;Haptens;Hemocyanins;Heroin;Incidence;Male;Methadone;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Naloxone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Piperidines;Prevalence;Proof of Concept Study;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Respiratory Depression;Self Administration;Serum Albumin, Bovine;Sufentanil;Therapeutics;Translations;Vaccination;Vaccines",Bradycardia;Diphtheria;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Respiratory Depression,J Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33229892,2021,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, reduces reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior in rats.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) causes the death of nearly 130 Americans daily. It is evident that new avenues for treatment are needed. To this end, studies have reported that 'satiety' agents such as the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, exendin-4 (Ex-4), decreases responding for addictive drugs such as cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, and oxycodone, but no work has been done with heroin. In this study, we used a reward devaluation model in which rats avoid ingesting a saccharin solution that predicts drug availability to test the effects of 2.4 μg/kg Ex-4 on responding for a natural reward cue (i.e., saccharin) and on cue- and drug-induced heroin seeking. The results showed that treatment with Ex-4 during the 16-day abstinence period and on the test day decreased cue-induced heroin seeking. Drug-induced heroin seeking also was reduced by Ex-4, but only when using a 1 h, but not a 6 h, pretreatment time. Treatment with Ex-4 did not alter intake of the saccharin cue when the drug was on board, but a history of treatment with Ex-4 increased acceptance of the saccharin cue in later extinction trials. Finally, treatment with Ex-4 did not alter body weight, but was associated with increased Orexin 1 receptor (OX1) mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens shell. Taken together, these findings are the first to show that treatment with a GLP-1R agonist can reduce both cue-induced seeking and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. As such, a GLP-1R agonist may serve as an effective treatment for OUD in humans.","Alcohols;Animals;Appetitive Behavior;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Body Weight;Cocaine;Cues;Death;Drug Discovery;Exenatide;Exendin-4;Gene Expression Regulation;Glucagon-Like Peptide 1;Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor;Heroin;History;Humans;Hypoglycemic Agents;Narcotics;News;Nicotine;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Use Disorder;Orexin A Receptor;Orexin Receptors;Orexins;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;RNA, Messenger;Rats;Reward;Saccharin;Satiety Response;Solutions;Therapeutics;Time;Work",Death;Opioid Use Disorder,Behav Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33344889,2020,Metabolism of a Kratom Alkaloid Metabolite in Human Plasma Increases Its Opioid Potency and Efficacy.,"Kratom is widely consumed in the United States for self-treatment of pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Mitragynine is the most abundant alkaloid in kratom and is a μ-opioid receptor agonist. 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG) is a mitragynine metabolite that is a more potent and efficacious opioid than its parent mitragynine. 7-HMG contributes to mitragynine's antinociceptive effects in mice, but evidence suggests it may also have a higher abuse potential. This in vitro study demonstrates that 7-HMG is stable in rodent and monkey plasma but is unstable in human plasma. Surprisingly, in human plasma 7-HMG is converted to mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, an opioid that is even more potent than either mitragynine or 7-HMG. This novel metabolite is formed in human plasma to a much greater extent than in the preclinical species tested (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey) and due to its μ-opioid potency may substantially contribute to the pharmacology of kratom in humans to a greater extent than in other tested species.","Alkaloids;Dogs;Humans;In Vitro;Macaca fascicularis;Metabolism;Mice;Mitragyna speciosa;Monkeys;Opioids;Pain;Parents;Pharmacology;Plasma;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Rodentia;Self;Therapeutics;United States;Withdrawal Symptoms",Pain;Withdrawal Symptoms,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33384303,2021,Pharmacological Comparison of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine: In Vitro Affinity and Efficacy for μ-Opioid Receptor and Opioid-Like Behavioral Effects in Rats.,"Relationships between µ-opioid receptor (MOR) efficacy and effects of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are not fully established. We assessed in vitro binding affinity and efficacy and discriminative stimulus effects together with antinociception in rats. The binding affinities of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine at MOR (Ki values 77.9 and 709 nM, respectively) were higher than their binding affinities at κ-opioid receptor (KOR) or δ-opioid receptor (DOR). [35S]guanosine 5'-O-[γ-thio]triphosphate stimulation at MOR demonstrated that mitragynine was an antagonist, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine was a partial agonist (Emax = 41.3%). In separate groups of rats discriminating either morphine (3.2 mg/kg) or mitragynine (32 mg/kg), mitragynine produced a maximum of 72.3% morphine-lever responding, and morphine produced a maximum of 65.4% mitragynine-lever responding. Other MOR agonists produced high percentages of drug-lever responding in the morphine and mitragynine discrimination assays: 7-hydroxymitragynine (99.7% and 98.1%, respectively), fentanyl (99.7% and 80.1%, respectively), buprenorphine (99.8% and 79.4%, respectively), and nalbuphine (99.4% and 98.3%, respectively). In the morphine and mitragynine discrimination assays, the KOR agonist U69,593 produced maximums of 72.3% and 22.3%, respectively, and the DOR agonist SNC 80 produced maximums of 34.3% and 23.0%, respectively. 7-Hydroxymitragynine produced antinociception; mitragynine did not. Naltrexone antagonized all of the effects of morphine and 7-hydroxymitragynine; naltrexone antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of mitragynine but not its rate-decreasing effects. Mitragynine increased the potency of the morphine discrimination yet decreased morphine antinociception. Here we illustrate striking differences in MOR efficacy, with mitragynine having less than 7-hydroxymitragynine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: At human µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in vitro, mitragynine has low affinity and is an antagonist, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine has 9-fold higher affinity than mitragynine and is an MOR partial agonist. In rats, intraperitoneal mitragynine exhibits a complex pharmacology including MOR agonism; 7-hydroxymitragynine has higher MOR potency and efficacy than mitragynine. These results are consistent with 7-hydroxymitragynine being a highly selective MOR agonist and with mitragynine having a complex pharmacology that combines low efficacy MOR agonism with activity at nonopioid receptors.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Binding Proteins;Buprenorphine;CHO Cells;Cricetulus;Discrimination Learning;Exhibition;Fentanyl;Guanosine;HEK293 Cells;Humans;In Vitro;Morphine;Nalbuphine;Naltrexone;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Rats;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids",,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33431611,2021,Methocinnamox Reverses and Prevents Fentanyl-Induced Ventilatory Depression in Rats.,"Opioid use disorder affects over 2 million Americans with an increasing number of deaths due to overdose from the synthetic opioid fentanyl and its analogs. The Food and Drug Administration-approved opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (e.g., Narcan) is used currently to treat overdose; however, a short duration of action limits its clinical utility. Methocinnamox (MCAM) is a long-lasting opioid receptor antagonist that may reverse and prevent the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl. This study compared the ability of naloxone (0.0001-10 mg/kg) and MCAM (0.0001-10 mg/kg) to reverse and prevent ventilatory depression by fentanyl and compared the duration of action of MCAM intravenously and subcutaneously in two procedures: ventilation and warm-water tail withdrawal. In male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 8), fentanyl (0.0032-0.178 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased minute volume in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a dose of 0.178 mg/kg decreasing VE to less than 40% of control. MCAM and naloxone reversed the ventilatory-depressant effects of 0.178 mg/kg fentanyl in a dose-related manner. The day after antagonist administration, MCAM but not naloxone attenuated the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl. The duration of action of MCAM lasted up to 3 days and at least 2 weeks after intravenous and subcutaneous administration, respectively. MCAM attenuated the antinociceptive effects of fentanyl, with antagonism lasting up to 5 days and more than 2 weeks after intravenous and subcutaneous administration, respectively. Reversal and prolonged antagonism by MCAM might provide an effective treatment option for the opioid crisis, particularly toxicity from fentanyl and related highly potent analogs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates that like naloxone, methocinnamox (MCAM) reverses the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl in a time- and dose-related manner. However, unlike naloxone, the duration of action of MCAM was greater than 2 weeks when administered subcutaneously and up to 5 days when administered intravenously. These data suggest that MCAM might be particularly useful for rescuing individuals from opioid overdose, including fentanyl overdose, as well as protecting against the reemergence of ventilatory depression (renarconization).","Ability;Administration;Affect;Animals;Cinnamates;Death;Fentanyl;Injections, Intravenous;Male;Morphine Derivatives;Naloxone;Narcan;Narcotic Antagonists;Narcotics;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Procedures;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Tail;Therapeutics;Time;United States Food and Drug Administration;Ventilation;Water",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33550801,2021,Movement to the Clinic of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitor EC5026 as an Analgesic for Neuropathic Pain and for Use as a Nonaddictive Opioid Alternative.,"This report describes the development of an orally active analgesic that resolves inflammation and neuropathic pain without the addictive potential of opioids. EC5026 acts on the cytochrome P450 branch of the arachidonate cascade to stabilize epoxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids (EpFA), which are natural mediators that reduce pain, resolve inflammation, and maintain normal blood pressure. EC5026 is a slow-tight binding transition-state mimic that inhibits the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) at picomolar concentrations. The sEH rapidly degrades EpFA; thus, inhibiting sEH increases EpFA in vivo and confers beneficial effects. This mechanism addresses disease states by shifting endoplasmic reticulum stress from promoting cellular senescence and inflammation toward cell survival and homeostasis. We describe the synthesis and optimization of EC5026 and its development through human Phase 1a trials with no drug-related adverse events. Additionally, we outline fundamental work leading to discovery of the analgesic and inflammation-resolving CYP450 branch of the arachidonate cascade.","Address;Analgesics;Animals;Blood Pressure;Cell Survival;Cellular Senescence;Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Disease;Dogs;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Enzyme Inhibitors;Epoxide Hydrolases;Epoxy Compounds;Homeostasis;Horses;Humans;Inflammation;Male;Molecular Structure;Movement;Neuralgia;Opioids;Outline;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenylurea Compounds;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Report;Structure-Activity Relationship;Work",Inflammation;Neuralgia;Pain,J Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33590767,2021,Exploring the putative mechanism of allosteric modulations by mixed-action kappa/mu opioid receptor bitopic modulators.,"The modulation and selectivity mechanisms of seven mixed-action kappa opioid receptor (KOR)/mu opioid receptor (MOR) bitopic modulators were explored. Molecular modeling results indicated that the 'message' moiety of seven bitopic modulators shared the same binding mode with the orthosteric site of the KOR and MOR, whereas the 'address' moiety bound with different subdomains of the allosteric site of the KOR and MOR. The 'address' moiety of seven bitopic modulators bound to different subdomains of the allosteric site of the KOR and MOR may exhibit distinguishable allosteric modulations to the binding affinity and/or efficacy of the 'message' moiety. Moreover, the 3-hydroxy group on the phenolic moiety of the seven bitopic modulators induced selectivity to the KOR over the MOR.","Address;Allosteric Regulation;Allosteric Site;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Exhibition;Humans;Ligands;Molecular Docking Simulation;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Morphinans;Naltrexone;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Spiro Compounds;Thermodynamics",,Future Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

33620222,2021,Pharmacokinetics of Eleven Kratom Alkaloids Following an Oral Dose of Either Traditional or Commercial Kratom Products in Rats.,"Kratom, Mitragyna speciosa Korth., is being widely consumed in the United States for pain management and the reduction of opioid withdrawal symptoms. The central nervous system (CNS) active alkaloids of kratom, including mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and numerous additional compounds, are believed to derive their effects through opioid receptor activity. There is no literature describing the systemic exposure of many of these alkaloids after the consumption of kratom. Therefore, we have developed and validated a bioanalytical method for the simultaneous quantitation of 11 kratom alkaloids (mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, corynantheidine, speciogynine, speciociliatine, paynantheine, corynoxine, corynoxine-B, mitraphylline, ajmalicine, and isospeciofoline) in rat plasma. The validated method was used to analyze oral pharmacokinetic study samples of lyophilized kratom tea (LKT) and a marketed product, OPMS liquid shot, in rats. Among the 11 alkaloids, only mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, speciociliatine, and corynantheidine showed systemic exposure 8 h postdose, and the dose-normalized systemic exposure of these four alkaloids was higher (1.6-2.4-fold) following the administration of the commercial OPMS liquid. Paynantheine and speciogynine levels were quantifiable up to 1 h postdose, whereas none of the other alkaloids were detected. In summary, the method was successfully applied to quantify the exposure of individual kratom alkaloids after an oral dose of traditional or commercial products. This information will contribute to understanding the role of each alkaloid in the overall pharmacology of kratom and elucidating the pharmacokinetic differences between traditional and commercial kratom products.","Administration;Alkaloids;Animals;Central Nervous System;Comprehension;Consumption;Indole Alkaloids;Indoles;Literature;Male;Methods;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Molecular Structure;Opioids;Overall;Oxindoles;Pain Management;Pharmacokinetics;Pharmacology;Plant Preparations;Plasma;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Role;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Spiro Compounds;Tea;United States;Withdrawal Symptoms",Pain;Withdrawal Symptoms,J Nat Prod,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

It was found that the 3-hydroxy group was crucial for the binding affinity of these derivatives for all three ORs due to the fact that all the analogues 1a-e exhibited significantly higher binding affinities compared to their counterpart 3-dehydroxy ones 6a-e. Meanwhile most compounds carrying the 3-hydroxy group possessed similar selectivity profiles for the kappa opioid receptor over the mu opioid receptor as their corresponding 3-dehydroxy derivatives. [35S]-GTPγS functional assay results indicated that the 3-hydroxy group of these epoxymorphinan derivatives was important for maintaining their potency on the ORs with various effects. Further molecular modeling studies helped comprehend the remarkably different binding affinity and functional profiles between compound 1c (NCP) and its 3-dehydroxy analogue 6c.","Binding Proteins;Carrying;Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate);Models, Molecular;Molecular Docking;Molecular Docking Simulation;Molecular Structure;Morphinans;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role",,Bioorg Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33635670,2021,Exploring the Chemistry of Alkaloids from Malaysian Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom) and the Role of Oxindoles on Human Opioid Receptors.,"Ten indole and oxindole alkaloids (1-10) were isolated from the freshly collected leaves of Malaysian Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom). The chemical structures of these compounds were established on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS data analysis. The spectroscopic data of mitragynine oxindole B (4) are reported herein for the first time. The spatial configuration of mitragynine oxindole B (4) was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Simultaneous quantification of the isolated alkaloids in the M. speciosa leaf specimens collected from different locations in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia was also performed using UPLC-MS/MS. The oxindole alkaloids (1-4) and the indole alkaloid (10) were assessed for binding affinity at opioid receptors. Corynoxine (1) showed high binding affinity to μ-opioid receptors with a Ki value of 16.4 nM. Further, corynoxine (1) was 1.8-fold more potent than morphine in rats subjected to a nociceptive hot plate assay. These findings have important implications for evaluating the combined effects of the minor oxindole alkaloids in the overall therapeutic activity of M. speciosa.","Alkaloids;Analgesics;Animals;Chemistry;Data Analysis;Female;Humans;Indole Alkaloids;Indoles;Malaysia;Male;Minors;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Molecular Structure;Morphine;Overall;Oxindoles;Plant Leaves;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Spiro Compounds;Therapeutics;Time;X-Ray Diffraction",,J Nat Prod,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33705855,2021,"A drug-vs-food ""choice"" self-administration procedure in rats to investigate pharmacological and environmental mechanisms of substance use disorders.","Preclinical drug self-administration procedures are commonly used to investigate expression, mechanisms, and treatment of substance use disorders. The aims were to back-translate an intravenous drug-vs-food choice procedure primarily utilized in monkeys to male and female rats and to develop a surgical method for sustained intravenous catheter patency suitable for long-term drug-choice studies. The surgical protocol resulted in a median intravenous jugular catheter patency in male and female rats of 126 days (range: 25-365 days). Drug-vs-food choice was established with opioids (fentanyl and heroin), psychostimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, and amphetamine), and an opioid/psychostimulant mixture (fentanyl + methamphetamine). The average time from catheter implantation to stable choice behavior across all drugs was 27 sessions (range: 16-44 sessions). Choice behavior stabilized more quickly for cocaine and fentanyl than for other drugs. Manipulations of both environmental variables (e.g., response requirement or food reinforcer magnitude) and pharmacological variables (e.g., extended access drug self-administration or continuous buprenorphine treatment via osmotic pump) significantly shifted opioid-vs-food choice consistent with previous monkey studies. Duration of intravenous catheter patency in rats was suitable for long-term, within-subject drug choice studies. Effects of environmental and pharmacological manipulations in rats confirmed and extended previous results from monkeys. The concordance of behavioral results between rats and monkeys using the present drug-vs-food choice procedure supports its utility to improve our basic understanding of the expression and mechanisms of substance use disorders towards to development of more effective therapeutics.","Amphetamine;Animals;Back;Buprenorphine;Catheters;Choice Behavior;Cocaine;Comprehension;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Fentanyl;Food;Food Preferences;Heroin;Male;Methamphetamine;Methods;Monkeys;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Rats;Self Administration;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time",Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Neurosci Methods,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

In vitro study results showed that introducing a nitrogen atom around the indole moiety not only retained excellent binding affinity, but also led to significant functional switch at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Further computational investigations provided corroborative evidence and plausible explanations of the results of the in vitro studies. Overall, our current work implemented a series of novel MOR ligands with high binding affinity and considerably low efficacy, which may shed light on rational design of low efficacy MOR ligands for opioid use disorder therapeutics.","Binding Sites;Humans;In Vitro;Indoles;Ligands;Light;Models, Molecular;Molecular Docking Simulation;Naltrexone;Nitrogen;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Protein Conformation;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Skeleton;Therapeutics;Work",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
33860918,2021,Characterization of a mouse neuropathic pain model caused by the highly active antiviral therapy (HAART) Stavudine.,"Although highly active antiviral therapies (HAART) exert control over viral replication in persons with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), neuropathic pain is a side effect. Symptoms include hyperalgesia and allodynia. Stavudine, also known as D4T, is a HAART used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This study examined the extent to which D4T produces neuropathic pain and examined pharmacological management with a standard opioid analgesic. Male and female C57BL/6 J mice were injected intraperitoneally with one dose of vehicle or D4T (10-56 mg/kg). Mice were tested through day 92 post injection for mechanical allodynia, assessed with von Frey filaments, and thermal hyperalgesia, assessed via the hotplate test. Separate cohorts received vehicle or 56 mg/kg D4T, the presence of allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia confirmed, and mice received intraperitoneal vehicle, morphine, or 0.032 mg/kg naltrexone + morphine. D4T produced dose- and time-dependent mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The smallest effective D4T dose was 17.8 mg/kg. This dose produced mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia. Larger D4T doses (32 and 56 mg/kg) produced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia lasting 92 days. Morphine dose-dependently alleviated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in D4T-treated mice with ED50 values of 4.4 and 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. Naltrexone produced a rightward shift of the morphine dose-response function, i.e., increased the ED50 value of morphine by at least 3.8-fold. Stavudine produced neuropathic pain as a function of dose and time in mice. Opioid analgesics appear to be effective in alleviating neuropathic pain in a D4T-induced mouse model.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Allodynia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Anti-HIV Agents;Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active;Antiviral Agents;Disease Models, Animal;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;HIV;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injections;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Morphine;Naltrexone;Neuralgia;Opioids;Persons;Standards;Stavudine;Therapeutics;Time;Virus Replication","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia",Pharmacol Rep,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34011529,2021,A Novel Maintenance Therapeutic for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major socioeconomic burden. An ideal OUD pharmacotherapy will mitigate the suffering associated with opioid-withdrawal, inhibit the effects of high efficacy opioids, and minimize opioid-cravings while being safe and accessible to a diverse patient population. Although current OUD pharmacotherapies inhibit the euphoric effects of opioids of abuse, the extent to which they safely alleviate withdrawal and opioid-cravings corresponds with their intrinsic µ opioid receptor (MOR) efficacy. In addition to inhibiting the euphoric effects of opioids of abuse, the medium efficacy MOR agonist buprenorphine alleviates withdrawal and opioid-cravings, but its intrinsic MOR efficacy is sufficient such that its utility is limited by abuse and safety liabilities. Although the MOR antagonist naltrexone minimizes euphoria and has no abuse liability, it exacerbates suffering associated with withdrawal and opioid cravings. Therefore, a therapeutic with intrinsic MOR activity between the partial agonist (buprenorphine) and the antagonist (naltrexone) would strike a balance between the benefits and liabilities of these two therapeutics. To address this need, we derived RM1490, an MOR agonist based on a nonmorphinan scaffold that exhibits approximately half the intrinsic MOR efficacy of buprenorphine. In a series of preclinical assays, we compared RM1490 with buprenorphine and naltrexone at doses that achieve therapeutic levels of central nervous system MOR occupancy. RM1490 exhibited a behavioral profile consistent with reduced reward, dependence, and precipitated withdrawal liabilities. RM1490 was also more effective than buprenorphine at reversing the respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl and did not suppress respiration when combined with diazepam. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In preclinical studies, RM1490 has a physiological and behavioral profile suitable for opioid use disorder maintenance therapy.","Address;Buprenorphine;Central Nervous System;Craving;Diazepam;Drug Therapy;Euphoria;Exhibition;Fentanyl;Maintenance;Naltrexone;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Population;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiration;Reward;Safety;Strikes, Employee;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34043402,2021,Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens/ventral capsule for severe and intractable opioid and benzodiazepine use disorder.,"Given high relapse rates and the prevalence of overdose deaths, novel treatments for substance use disorder (SUD) are desperately needed for those who are treatment refractory. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for SUD and the effects of DBS on substance use, substance craving, emotional symptoms, and frontal/executive functions. DBS electrodes were implanted bilaterally within the Nucleus Accumbens/Ventral anterior internal capsule (NAc/VC) of a man in his early 30s with &gt;10-year history of severe treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorders. DBS of the NAc/VC was found to be safe with no serious adverse events noted and the participant remained abstinent and engaged in comprehensive treatment at the 12-week endpoint (and 12-month extended follow-up). Using a 0-100 visual analog scale, substance cravings decreased post-DBS implantation; most substantially in benzodiazepine craving following the final DBS titration (1.0 ± 2.2) compared to baseline (53.4 ± 29.5; p &lt; .001). A trend toward improvement in frontal/executive function was observed on the balloon analog risk task performance following the final titration (217.7 ± 76.2) compared to baseline (131.3 ± 28.1, p = .066). FDG PET demonstrated an increase in glucose metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal and medial premotor cortices at the 12-week endpoint compared to post-surgery/pre-DBS titration. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) improved following the final titration (rMSSD = 56.0 ± 11.7) compared to baseline (19.2 ± 8.2; p &lt; .001). In a participant with severe, treatment refractory opioid and benzodiazepine use disorder, DBS of the NAc/VC was safe, reduced substance use and craving, and improved frontal and executive functions. Confirmation of these findings with future studies is needed.

34114163,2021,Engineering Quick- and Long-acting Naloxone Delivery Systems for Treating Opioid Overdose.,"Opioids have been the main factor for drug overdose deaths in the United States. Current naloxone delivery systems are effective in mitigating the opioid effects only for hours. Naloxone-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were prepared as quick- and long-acting naloxone delivery systems to extend the naloxone effect as an opioid antidote. The naloxone-PLGA microparticles were made using an emulsification solvent extraction approach with different formulation and processing parameters. Two PLGA polymers with the lactide:glycolide (L:G) ratios of 50:50 and 75:25 were used, and the drug loading was varied from 21% to 51%. Two different microparticles of different sizes with the average diameters of 23 μm and 50 μm were produced using two homogenization-sieving conditions. All the microparticles were critically characterized, and three of them were evaluated with β-arrestin recruitment assays. The naloxone encapsulation efficiency (EE) was in the range of 70-85%. The EE was enhanced when the theoretical naloxone loading was increased from 30% to 60%, the L:G ratio was changed from 50:50 to 75:25, and the average size of the particles was reduced from 50 μm to 23 μm. The in vitro naloxone release duration ranged from 4 to 35 days. Reducing the average size of the microparticles from 50 μm to 23 μm helped eliminate the lag phase and obtain the steady-state drug release profile. The cellular pharmacodynamics of three selected formulations were evaluated by applying DAMGO, a synthetic opioid peptide agonist to a μ-opioid receptor, to recruit β-arrestin 2. Naloxone released from the three selected formulations could inhibit DAMGO-induced β-arrestin 2 recruitment. This indicates that the proposed naloxone delivery system is adequate for opioid reversal during the naloxone release duration.","Animals;Antidotes;CHO Cells;Cricetulus;Death;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Carriers;Drug Liberation;Drug Overdose;Efficiency;Engineering;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Humans;In Vitro;Microspheres;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Peptides;Opioids;Particle Size;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poly(Lactide-Co-Glycoside);Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer;Polymers;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Solvents;Surface Properties;Time Factors;United States;beta-Arrestin 2;beta-Arrestins",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Pharm Res,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34126123,2021,Pharmacological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of antibodies generated by a vaccine to treat oxycodone use disorder.,"Therapeutic vaccines offer a viable strategy to treat opioid use disorders (OUD) complementary to current pharmacotherapies. The candidate Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH vaccine targeting oxycodone displayed pre-clinical proof of efficacy, selectivity and safety, and it is now undergoing clinical evaluation. To further support its implementation in the clinic, this study tested critical in vivo neuropsychopharmacological properties of the Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH vaccine in rats. While repeated immunizations with Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH were necessary to maintain the antibody response overtime, exposure to free oxycodone did not boost oxycodone-specific antibody levels in vaccinated rats, limiting concerns of immune-related side effects. Immunization with Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH achieved sustained antibody titers over a period of five months following initial vaccination, supporting its potential for providing long-lasting protection. In vivo studies of selectivity showed that vaccination prevented oxycodone-induced but not methadone-induced antinociception, while still preserving the opioid antagonist naloxone's pharmacological effects. Vaccination did not interfere with fentanyl-induced antinociception or fentanyl distribution to the brain. These in vivo data confirm the previously reported in vitro selectivity profile of Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH. Vaccination extended oxycodone's half-life up to 25 h compared to control. While vaccination reduced the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in an intravenous self-administration model, signs of toxicity were not observed. These rodent studies confirm that active immunization with Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH induces highly specific and long-lasting antibodies which are effective in decreasing the reinforcing effects of oxycodone while preserving the efficacy of medications used to treat OUD and overdose.","Animals;Antibodies;Antibody Formation;Brain;Drug Therapy;Fentanyl;Half-Life;Immunization;Immunization, Active;In Vitro;Male;Methadone;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Oxycodone;Rats;Rodentia;Safety;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Vaccination;Vaccines",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Neuropharmacology,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34213886,2021,Kratom Alkaloids as Probes for Opioid Receptor Function: Pharmacological Characterization of Minor Indole and Oxindole Alkaloids from Kratom.,"Dry leaves of kratom (mitragyna speciosa) are anecdotally consumed as pain relievers and antidotes against opioid withdrawal and alcohol use disorders. There are at least 54 alkaloids in kratom; however, investigations to date have focused around mitragynine, 7-hydroxy mitragynine (7OH), and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (MP). Herein, we probe a few minor indole and oxindole based alkaloids, reporting the receptor affinity, G-protein activity, and βarrestin-2 signaling of corynantheidine, corynoxine, corynoxine B, mitraciliatine, and isopaynantheine at mouse and human opioid receptors. We identify corynantheidine as a mu opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, whereas its oxindole derivative corynoxine was an MOR full agonist. Similarly, another alkaloid mitraciliatine was found to be an MOR partial agonist, while isopaynantheine was a KOR agonist which showed reduced βarrestin-2 recruitment. Corynantheidine, corynoxine, and mitraciliatine showed MOR dependent antinociception in mice, but mitraciliatine and corynoxine displayed attenuated respiratory depression and hyperlocomotion compared to the prototypic MOR agonist morphine in vivo when administered supraspinally. Isopaynantheine on the other hand was identified as the first kratom derived KOR agonist in vivo. While these minor alkaloids are unlikely to play the majority role in the biological actions of kratom, they represent excellent starting points for further diversification as well as distinct efficacy and signaling profiles with which to probe opioid actions in vivo.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Alkaloids;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Antidotes;Biopharmaceuticals;Dates;GTP-Binding Proteins;Hand;Humans;Indoles;Mice;Minors;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Morphine;Opioids;Oxindoles;Pain;Play;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiration;Respiratory Depression;Role;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Pain;Respiratory Depression,ACS Chem Neurosci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34252907,2022,Antagonism of the mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimer enhances opioid antinociception by activating Src and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling.,"The opioid receptors are important regulators of pain, reward, and addiction. Limited evidence suggests the mu and delta opioid receptors form a heterodimer (MDOR), which may act as a negative feedback brake on opioid-induced analgesia. However, evidence for the MDOR in vivo is indirect and limited, and there are few selective tools available. We recently published the first MDOR-selective antagonist, D24M, allowing us to test the role of the MDOR in mice. We thus cotreated CD-1 mice with D24M and opioids in tail flick, paw incision, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain models. D24M treatment enhanced oxymorphone antinociception in all models by 54.7% to 628%. This enhancement could not be replicated with the mu and delta selective antagonists CTAP, naltrindole, and naloxonazine, and D24M had a mild transient effect in the rotarod test, suggesting this increase is selective to the MDOR. However, D24M had no effect on morphine or buprenorphine, suggesting that only specific opioids interact with the MDOR. To find a mechanism, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis on brainstems of mice. We found that the kinases Src and CaMKII were repressed by oxymorphone, which was restored by D24M. We were able to confirm the role of Src and CaMKII in D24M-enhanced antinociception using small molecule inhibitors (KN93 and Src-I1). Together, these results provide direct in vivo evidence that the MDOR acts as an opioid negative feedback brake, which occurs through the repression of Src and CaMKII signal transduction. These results further suggest that MDOR antagonism could be a means to improve clinical opioid therapy.","Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Brain Stem;Buprenorphine;Calcium;Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2;Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases;Drug Therapy;Feedback;Form;Mice;Morphine;Opioids;Oxymorphone;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Reward;Role;Rotarod Performance Test;Signal Transduction;Tail;Therapeutics;Transients;src-Family Kinases",Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Pain,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34292206,2021,Modulatory Effects of Actual and Imagined Acupuncture on the Functional Connectivity of the Periaqueductal Gray and Ventral Tegmental Area.,"Both acupuncture and guided imagery hold promise for treating pain. The mechanisms underlying these alternative interventions remain unclear. The reported study aimed to comparatively investigate the modulation effect of actual and imagined acupuncture on the functional connectivity of descending pain modulation system and reward network. Twenty-four healthy participants (mean [standard error], 25.21 [0.77] years of age; 66.67% female) completed a crossover study that included five sessions, a training session and four intervention sessions administered in randomized order. We investigated the modulation effect of real acupuncture, sham acupuncture, video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT) and VGAIT control on the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of periaqueductal gray (PAG) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). These are key regions of the descending pain modulatory system and dopaminergic reward system, respectively. Compared with sham acupuncture, real acupuncture produced decreased PAG-precuneus (Pcu) rsFC and increased VTA-amygdala/hippocampus rsFC. Heat pain threshold changes applied on the contralateral forearm were significantly associated with the decreased PAG-Pcu (r = 0.49, p = .016) and increased VTA-hippocampus rsFC (r = -0.77, p &lt; .001). Compared with VGAIT control, VGAIT produced decreased PAG-paracentral lobule/posterior cingulate cortex/Pcu, middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and medial prefrontal cortex rsFC, and decreased VTA-caudate and MCC rsFC. Direct comparison between real acupuncture and VGAIT showed that VGAIT decreased rsFC in PAG-paracentral lobule/MCC, VTA-caudate/anterior cingulate cortex/nucleus accumbens, and VTA-MCC. Results suggest that both actual and imagined acupuncture can modulate key regions in the descending pain modulatory system and reward networks, but through different pathways. Identification of different pain relief mechanisms may facilitate the development of new pain management methods.","Acupuncture;Acupuncture Therapy;Aged;Amygdala;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Cingulate Cortex;Cross-Over Studies;Female;Forearm;Healthy Volunteers;Heat;Hippocampus;Humans;Imagery, Psychotherapy;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Methods;News;Nucleus Accumbens;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Threshold;Periaqueductal Gray;Posterior Paracentral Lobule;Precuneus Cortex;Prefrontal Cortex;Reward;Standards;Therapeutics;Ventral Tegmental Area",Pain,Psychosom Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34363827,2021,Morphine restores and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal depresses wheel running in rats with hindpaw inflammation.,"Opioids such as morphine are the most effective treatment for pain, but termination of opioid use can produce severe withdrawal symptoms. The present study models this process by using home cage wheel running to assess well-being as a result of pain, morphine analgesia, and opioid withdrawal. Injection of CFA into the right hindpaw caused a dramatic decrease in wheel running and body weight. Implantation of two morphine pellets (75 mg each) resulted in an increase in body weight on Day 1 of administration and a more gradual restoration of wheel running that was only evident during the dark phase of the circadian cycle on Days 3 and 4 of morphine administration. Continuous morphine administration decreased wheel running during the relatively inactive light phase. These findings are consistent with the clinical goal of pain therapeutics to restore normal activity during the day and facilitate sleep at night. Administration of naloxone (1 mg/kg) on Day 5 of morphine administration depressed wheel running for approximately 4 h and caused an increase in wet dog shakes. Naloxone-precipitated changes were no longer evident 6 h after administration. These findings demonstrate that the use of morphine to treat pain does not protect against opioid withdrawal. Moreover, this study provides additional support for the use of home cage wheel running as a method to assess changes in well-being as a result of pain, analgesia, and opioid withdrawal.","Administration;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Body Weight;Dogs;Goals;Inflammation;Injections;Light;Male;Methods;Morphine;Motor Activity;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Running;Sleep;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Withdrawal Symptoms",Inflammation;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34403125,2022,A Clinical Trial of a Program for Pain Management and Opioid Reduction During Pregnancy.,"A substantial proportion of pregnant women use prescription opioids. However, the lack of efficacy of chronic prescription opioid use for pain, combined with an increased risk of these medications in general and during pregnancy, suggests that the risks of these medications may outweigh the benefits of continued use. Though research has not evaluated non-pharmacological approaches to treat chronic pain during pregnancy, research conducted with the general population outside of pregnancy suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective, non-pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for chronic pain paired with shared decision-making for prescription opioid dose reduction among pregnant women with prescription opioid misuse. The study was an open-label, 8-week clinical trial of CBT for chronic pain and shared decision-making for prescription opioid dose reduction. Participants included a clinical sample of 20 pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 45 years who were misusing opioids but did not meet DSM-IV criteria for an opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder. Compared to baseline, at 8 weeks, participants had significant reductions in average prescription opioid morphine equivalent dose, prescription opioid misuse, worst pain ratings, and pain interference in general activity and at work. They did not report improvement in other pain ratings or areas of functioning. This study provides valuable information regarding the preliminary efficacy of CBT for chronic pain paired with shared decision-making among pregnant women misusing prescription opioids.

34467758,2021,"Activity of Mitragyna speciosa (""Kratom"") Alkaloids at Serotonin Receptors.","Kratom alkaloids have mostly been evaluated for their opioid activity but less at other targets that could contribute to their physiological effects. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo activity of kratom alkaloids at serotonin receptors (5-HTRs). Paynantheine and speciogynine exhibited high affinity for 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT2BRs, unlike the principal kratom alkaloid mitragynine. Both alkaloids produced antinociceptive properties in rats via an opioid receptor-independent mechanism, and neither activated 5-HT2BRs in vitro. Paynantheine, speciogynine, and mitragynine induced lower lip retraction and antinociception in rats, effects blocked by a selective 5-HT1AR antagonist. In vitro functional assays revealed that the in vivo 5-HT1AR agonistic effects may be due to the metabolites 9-O-desmethylspeciogynine and 9-O-desmethylpaynantheine and not the parent compounds. Both metabolites did not activate 5-HT2BR, suggesting low inherent risk of causing valvulopathy. The 5-HT1AR agonism by kratom alkaloids may contribute to the mood-enhancing effects associated with kratom use.","Alkaloids;Analgesics;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Female;HEK293 Cells;Humans;In Vitro;Lip;Male;Mitragyna speciosa;Mood;Nociceptive Pain;Opioids;Parents;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Serotonin;Risk;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Serotonin",Nociceptive Pain,J Med Chem,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34537839,2022,"A retrospective, observational study on medication for opioid use disorder during pregnancy and risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome.","The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women is increasing. Research consistently demonstrates the efficacy of medications for OUD (MOUD); however, researchers have called for additional studies evaluating the safety of MOUD during pregnancy, particularly the relative safety of two commonly used MOUD medications-methadone and buprenorphine. This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of MOUD exposure during pregnancy on risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). In a clinical sample of infants born to women with OUD, we evaluated the risk of NAS among those exposed to (i) methadone and (ii) buprenorphine compared with those unexposed to MOUD, as well as the risk of NAS among those exposed to (i) methadone compared with those exposed to (ii) buprenorphine. Compared with buprenorphine-exposed infants (n = 37), methadone-exposed infants (n = 27) were at increased risk for NAS (odds ratio [OR] = 4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 21.17). Compared with unexposed infants (n = 43), buprenorphine-exposed infants were at decreased risk for NAS (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.14, 1.39) and methadone-exposed infants were at increased risk for NAS (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 0.79, 8.76), though these associations were not statistically significant. Our study suggests that when methadone and buprenorphine are equally appropriate options for the treatment of OUD in pregnant women, buprenorphine may add the additional benefit of reduced risk of newborn NAS.","Addiction Medicine;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Confidence Intervals;Female;Gynecology;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Methadone;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Neonatology;Observational Study;Obstetrics;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Postnatal Care;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnant Women;Prevalence;Relatives;Research;Research Personnel;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Safety;Substance Abuse;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Women;Women's Health",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Abuse,Fam Pract,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34619714,2022,Integration of Patient-reported Outcomes Assessment Into Routine Care for Patients Receiving Residential Treatment for Alcohol and/or Substance Use Disorder.,"More than 3 million individuals receive treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or substance use disorder each year, yet there exists no standardized method for measuring patient success in treatment. Quantifying a more comprehensive assessment of treatment outcomes could identify the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies for individuals with AUD/substance use disorders, and help patients to identify, in advance, appropriate treatment options. This study developed and embedded patient-reported outcome measures into the routine clinical operations of a residential treatment program. Surveys assessed demographics, drug use history, physical and mental health, and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed among participants at admission (n = 961) and in patients who completed the survey at time of discharge (n = 633). Past 30-day alcohol and/or opioid use at admission were correlated with worse self-reported physical and mental health, sleep, and quality of life, and greater negative affect and craving ( P s &lt; 0.05). Previous history of treatment and/or withdrawal management were associated with worse self-reported physical and mental health, quality of life, and increased craving ( P s &lt; 0.05). Physical and mental health improved across timepoints and was most pronounced when comparing persons receiving treatment for opioid use disorder versus AUD, wherein persons with opioid use disorder had worse physical health at all time points, and greater sleep disturbance and negative affect at discharge ( P s &lt; 0.05).

34680158,2021,"Alternative Pre-mRNA Splicing of the Mu Opioid Receptor Gene, OPRM1: Insight into Complex Mu Opioid Actions.","Most opioid analgesics used clinically, including morphine and fentanyl, as well as the recreational drug heroin, act primarily through the mu opioid receptor, a class A Rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The single-copy mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating multiple splice variants or isoforms via a variety of alternative splicing events. These OPRM1 splice variants can be categorized into three major types based on the receptor structure: (1) full-length 7 transmembrane (TM) C-terminal variants; (2) truncated 6TM variants; and (3) single TM variants. Increasing evidence suggests that these OPRM1 splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating the distinct actions of various mu opioids. More importantly, the OPRM1 variants can be targeted for development of novel opioid analgesics that are potent against multiple types of pain, but devoid of many side-effects associated with traditional opiates. In this review, we provide an overview of OPRM1 alternative splicing and its functional relevance in opioid pharmacology.","Alternative Splicing;Analgesics, Opioid;Fentanyl;Gene Targeting;Genes;Heroin;Humans;Mediating;Morphine;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Pain;Pharmacology;Protein Isoforms;RNA Precursor;RNA Splicing;RNA, Messenger, Precursors;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Recreational Drugs;Review;Rhodopsin",Pain,Biomolecules,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34759012,2022,The Lack of Contribution of 7-Hydroxymitragynine to the Antinociceptive Effects of Mitragynine in Mice: A Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study.,"Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a Southeast Asian tree, has been used for centuries in pain relief and mitigation of opium withdrawal symptoms. Mitragynine (MTG), the major kratom alkaloid, is being investigated for its potential to provide analgesia without the deleterious effects associated with typical opioids. Concerns have been raised regarding the active metabolite of MTG, 7-hydroxymitragynine (7HMG), which has higher affinity and efficacy at µ-opioid receptors than MTG. Here we investigated the hotplate antinociception, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution of MTG and 7HMG at equianalgesic oral doses in male and female C57BL/6 mice to determine the extent to which 7HMG metabolized from MTG accounts for the antinociceptive effects of MTG and investigate any sex differences. The mechanism of action was examined by performing studies with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to predict the behavioral effects after administration of various doses of MTG and 7HMG. When administered alone, 7HMG was 2.8-fold more potent than MTG to produce antinociception. At equivalent effective doses of MTG and 7HMG, there was a marked difference in the maximum brain concentration of 7HMG achieved, i.e., 11-fold lower as a metabolite of MTG. The brain concentration of 7HMG observed 4 hours post administration, producing an analgesic effect &lt;10%, was still 1.5-fold higher than the maximum concentration of 7HMG as a metabolite of MTG. These results provide strong evidence that 7HMG has a negligible role in the antinociceptive effects of MTG in mice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mitragynine (MTG) is being investigated for its potential to aid in pain relief, opioid withdrawal syndrome, and opioid use disorder. The active metabolite of MTG, 7-hydroxymitragynine (7HMG), has been shown to have abuse potential and has been implicated in the opioid-like analgesic effect after MTG administration. The results of this study suggest a lack of involvement of 7HMG in the antinociceptive effects of MTG in mice.","Administration;Alkaloids;Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Asians;Brain;Female;HMGA Proteins;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mitragyna speciosa;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Opium;Pain;Pharmacokinetics;Population;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Sex Characteristics;Syndrome;Tissue Distribution;Trees;Withdrawal Symptoms",Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,Drug Metab Dispos,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Ligands that activate the nociceptin opioid peptide receptor (NOP) constitute one class of candidate drugs for both applications. The present preclinical study determined the effectiveness of the NOP agonist Ro 64-6198 to produce antinociception in a pain-depressed behavior procedure and attenuate opioid self-administration in a heroin-vs-food choice procedure. In Experiment 1, Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were equipped with microelectrodes and trained to respond for electrical brain stimulation in an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure. The potency, time course, and receptor mechanism of effects produced by R0 64-6198 alone (0.32-3.2 mg/kg) on ICSS were examined, followed by evaluation of 0.32-1.0 mg/kg Ro 64-6198 effectiveness to block lactic acid-induced depression of ICSS. In Experiment 2, rats self-administered heroin under a heroin-vs-food choice procedure during a regimen of repeated, daily intraperitoneal administration of vehicle or Ro 64-6198 (1-3.2 mg/kg/day). Ro 64-6198 produced dose- and time-dependent ICSS depression that was blocked by the selective NOP antagonist SB612111 but not by naltrexone. Ro 64-6198 failed to block acid-induced depression of ICSS. Repeated Ro 64-6198 pretreatment also failed to attenuate heroin-vs-food choice up to doses that significantly decreased operant behavior. These results do not support the utility of Ro 64-6198 as a stand-alone medication for either acute pain or opioid use disorder.","Acids;Acute Pain;Administration;Adult;Animals;Behavior;Brain;Depression;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Development;Food;Heroin;Imidazoles;Lactic Acid;Ligands;Microelectrodes;Naltrexone;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Opioid Peptides;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Research;Self;Self Administration;Self Stimulation;Spiro Compounds;Time",Acute Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

The thalamus serves as a primary relay center to transmit sensory information and motor impulses via dense connections with the somatosensory and motor cortex. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (probabilistic tractography) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (functional connectivity) were used to characterize the anatomical and functional integrity of the thalamo-sensorimotor pathway in chronic low back pain (cLBP). Fifty-four patients with cLBP and 54 healthy controls were included. The results suggested significantly increased anatomical connectivity of the left thalamo-motor pathway characterized by probabilistic tractography in patients with cLBP. Moreover, there was significantly altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of bilateral thalamo-motor/somatosensory pathways in patients with cLBP as compared to healthy controls. We also detected a significant correlation between pain intensity during the MRI scan and rsFC of the right thalamo-somatosensory pathway in cLBP.

35341571,2022,In vitro and in vivo pharmacology of kratom.,"Kratom products have been historically and anecdotally used in south Asian countries for centuries to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. The use of kratom products has dramatically increased in the United States. More than 45 kratom alkaloids have been isolated, yet the overall pharmacology of the individual alkaloids is still not well characterized. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize in vitro and in vivo opioid activities of the primary kratom alkaloid mitragynine and its more potent metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine. Following are experimental procedures described to characterize opioid receptor activity; receptor binding and functional assays, antinociceptive assays, operant conditioning assays, and respiratory plethysmography. The capacity of kratom alkaloids to confer tolerance and physical dependence as well as their pharmacokinetic properties are also summarized. The data reviewed here suggest that kratom products and mitragynine possess low efficacy agonist activity at the mu-opioid receptor in vivo. In addition, kratom products and mitragynine have been demonstrated to antagonize the effects of high efficacy mu-opioid agonists. The data further suggest that 7-hydroxymitragynine formed in vivo by metabolism of mitragynine may be minimally involved in the overall behavioral profile of mitragynine and kratom, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine itself, at sufficiently high doses administered exogenously, shares many of the same abuse- and dependence-related behavioral effects associated with traditional opioid agonists. The apparent low efficacy of kratom products and mitragynine at mu-opioid receptors supports the development of these ligands as effective and potentially safe medications for opioid use disorder.","Alkaloids;Analgesics, Opioid;Asians;Conditioning, Operant;Humans;In Vitro;Ligands;Metabolism;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacokinetics;Pharmacology;Plethysmography;Procedures;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Schedules;Self Administration;Substance-Related Disorders;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Substance-Related Disorders,Adv Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35469698,2022,Pre-clinical safety and toxicology profile of a candidate vaccine to treat oxycodone use disorder.,"Opioid use disorders (OUD) and overdose represent a public health threat, resulting in thousands of deaths annually worldwide. Vaccines offer a promising treatment for OUD and potentially the prevention of fatal overdoses. The Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH Conjugate Vaccine, Adsorbed (Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH) has shown promising pre-clinical efficacy at reducing the behavioral and pharmacological effects of oxycodone. To support its clinical evaluation, a GLP toxicology study was performed to address the safety of Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH. Sprague Dawley rats were vaccinated with either aluminum adjuvant (alum) or vaccine adsorbed on alum. Low and high doses of Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH, equivalent to a 1X or 47X human dose, respectively, were administered every two weeks for a total of four vaccinations. Both vaccine doses induced high antibody titers. Vaccine-related toxicity was assessed postmortem in one experimental group after receiving the fourth immunization of the vaccine's high dose. For the remaining experimental groups, rats were challenged with 1.5 mg/kg/day s.c. oxycodone for 7 days after the fourth vaccination to assess whether concurrent exposure to oxycodone in vaccinated animals resulted in toxicity. All rats, except a subset of the aluminum control and the high dose vaccine groups, were sacrificed following oxycodone exposure.

35555956,2022,Probing the Activity of Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom) Alkaloids at Serotonin G Protein-Coupled Receptors.,"The nation's persistent opioid epidemic requires innovative treatment interventions. Mitragyna speciosa, or kratom, is an alkaloid-containing tropical plant that has emerged as a potential opioid substitute therapy in recent decades. There are, however, no FDA-approved uses for kratom, and scientists are actively engaged to elucidate the potential therapeutic benefits and harmful effects of kratom. Studies of kratom alkaloids have mainly focused on their opioid receptor activity, but emerging data show kratom has physiologically-relevant activity at other biological targets. We recently reported that two kratom alkaloids prevalent in leaves of the kratom plant, speciogynine and paynantheine, bind to serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT2BRs with affinities (Ki) less ≤100 nM and that their 9-O-desmethyl metabolites are efficacious agonists at 5-HT1ARs (León et al., 2021 PMID: 34467758). We are undertaking studies to evaluate the pharmacology of the most prevalent alkaloids found in kratom leaves at each of the genetically-encoded 5-HT G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To further elucidate 5-HTR G-protein transduction pathways modulated by kratom alkaloids, we are utilizing the TRUPATH biosensor platform. By evaluating the potency and efficacy of kratom alkaloids to modulate the activity of unique G alpha subtypes linked to 5-HTRs, we will provide fundamental 5-HTR pharmacological characteristics of kratom alkaloids. The 5-HT2BR is a crucial target for drug safety profiling since activation of this receptor can lead to cardiac valvulopathy. In addition, we are testing kratom alkaloids with an appreciable 5-HT2BR affinity for their potential mitogenic activity in HEK cells utilizing [3H]thymidine incorporation. This research will provide crucial information about kratom's pharmacological profile, independent of opioid receptors, that may contribute to its physiological effects.","Alkaloids;Analgesics, Opioid;Biopharmaceuticals;Biosensors;Cells;GTP-Binding Proteins;Lead;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Plant Leaves;Plants;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Opioid;Research;Safety;Serotonin;Therapeutics;Thymidine",,FASEB J,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35556777,2022,Multivalent Vaccine Strategies against Polydrug Use in Opioid Use Disorders.,"The number of annual fatal drug overdoses reached more than 100,000 between April 2020 to 2021, of which the majority involved individual opioids or polydrug mixtures containing opioids. A series of conjugate vaccines targeting fentanyl, carfentanil, oxycodone, heroin, and their analogs or metabolites have shown preclinical proof of efficacy, selectivity, and safety. Individual vaccines consist of haptens, small molecules that mimic the structure of the targeted drug, conjugated to carrier proteins, such as detoxified diphtheria toxin (CRM) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These studies identified lead haptens based on fentanyl (Fen), carfentanil (Carf), oxycodone (Oxy), and heroin (Her). Preclinical studies showed the efficacy of each vaccine (Fen-CRM, Carf-CRM, Oxy-KLH, and Her-KLH) in blocking their respective target drug distribution to the brain and their behavioral effects in mice and rats. While multivalent vaccine formulations are commonly used as a safe and effective strategy against infectious diseases, multivalent vaccination strategies against polydrug use have not yet been fully explored at treating substance use disorders. In the current study, the balb/c mice were vaccinated with a combination of Fen-CRM, Carf-CRM, Oxy-KLH, and Her-KLH as a quadrivalent vaccine. ELISA showed that quadrivalent vaccine increased fentanyl-, carfentanil-, oxycodone-, and heroin-specific IgG titers in the immunized mice. Correspondingly, this simultaneous immunization prevented the distributions of fentanyl, carfentanil, oxycodone, and heroin to the brain when the mice were challenged by the mixture of these drugs. These data demonstrate that individual efficacy of monovalent vaccine was preserved in a multivalent formulation without interference. Amid opioid epidemics, multivalent vaccine strategies will provide a broad spectrum of protection against multiple opioids with a single vaccination.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Brain;Carrier Proteins;Communicable Diseases;Diphtheria Toxin;Drug Overdose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Fentanyl;Haptens;Hemocyanins;Heroin;Immunization;Immunoglobulin G;Lead;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Multivalent Vaccines;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Safety;Substance Use Disorders;Tetravalent Vaccines;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vaccines, Combined;Vaccines, Conjugate",Communicable Diseases;Diphtheria;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,FASEB J,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35560575,2022,"Interactions between Fentanyl and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), a 5-HT2A Receptor Agonist, in Rhesus Monkeys Responding under a Food Versus Drug Choice Procedure.","5-HT2A receptor agonists such as DOM enhance antinociceptive effects of opioids suggesting a 5-HT2A receptor agonist could be combined with an opioid to improve treatment of pain. However, it is unclear whether 5-HT2A receptor agonists also enhance adverse effects of opioids, including positive reinforcing effects that contribute to abuse. This study examined whether DOM alters the reinforcing effects of fentanyl in rhesus monkeys (n=5) responding under a food versus drug choice procedure. Responding on one lever delivered sucrose pellets and responding on the other lever delivered intravenous infusions. Sessions comprised 4 blocks, each with 2 forced trials, during which only one option was available, followed by 6 choice trials, during which both options were available. The unit dose of fentanyl (0.0001-0.0032 mg/kg/infusion) increased across blocks each session. In the first experiment, sessions were preceded by intravenous administration of DOM (0032-0.32 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg), or heroin (0.1 mg/kg). Then, fentanyl was available for self-administration in combination with DOM in unit dose ratios (fentanyl to DOM) of 1:3, 1:10, or 1:30. Fentanyl increased choice of infusions from less than 10% of trials with the two smallest unit doses to over 80% of trials with the two larger unit doses. Naltrexone decreased choice of fentanyl, shifting the dose-effect curve rightward, and heroin increased choice of the two smallest unit doses of fentanyl. When administered before the session, DOM reduced choice of fentanyl as well as the number of trials completed. However, DOM did not alter choice or the number of trials completed when available in combination with fentanyl. Attenuation of fentanyl choice by naltrexone and enhancement of fentanyl choice by heroin demonstrate sensitivity of responding to modulation by other drugs. DOM did not appear to enhance the reinforcing effects of fentanyl whether given as a pretreatment or made available in combination with fentanyl. Although pretreatment with DOM decreased choice of fentanyl, it did so at doses that reduced trials completed, suggesting effects of DOM might have been due, at least in part, to generalized rate-decreasing effects. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that DOM enhances some (antinociceptive) but not other (reinforcing) effects of opioids and that combining a 5-HT2A receptor agonist with an opioid to treat pain would not increase potential for abuse.","2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine;Administration, Intravenous;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Interactions;Fentanyl;Food;Heroin;Infusions, Intravenous;Macaca mulatta;Methamphetamine;Naltrexone;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A;Self Administration;Sensitivity;Sucrose;Therapeutics",Pain,FASEB J,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35592436,2022,"Efficacy and Selectivity of Monovalent and Bivalent Vaccination Strategies to Protect against Exposure to Carfentanil, Fentanyl, and Their Mixtures in Rats.","Drug-related fatal overdoses have significantly increased in the past decade due to the widespread availability of illicit fentanyl and other potent synthetic opioids such as carfentanil. Deliberate or accidental consumption or exposure to carfentanil, fentanyl, and their mixture induces respiratory depression and bradycardia that can be difficult to reverse with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Vaccines offer a promising strategy to reduce the incidence of fatalities associated with fentanyl-related substances, as well as treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). This study reports monovalent and bivalent vaccination strategies that elicit polyclonal antibody responses effective in protecting against the pharmacological actions of carfentanil, fentanyl, or carfentanil/fentanyl mixtures. Rats were prophylactically immunized with individual conjugate vaccines containing either carfentanil- or fentanyl-based haptens, or their combination in bivalent vaccine formulations, and then challenged with carfentanil, fentanyl, or their mixture. First, these studies identified a lead vaccine protective against carfentanil-induced antinociception, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. Then, efficacy against both carfentanil and fentanyl was achieved through bivalent vaccination strategies that combined lead anti-carfentanil and anti-fentanyl vaccines via either heterologous prime/boost or co-administration immunization regimens. These preclinical data support the development of vaccines as a viable strategy to prevent toxicity from exposure to excessive doses of carfentanil, fentanyl, or their mixtures.","Administration;Antibody Formation;Bivalent Vaccines;Bradycardia;Consumption;Fentanyl;Haptens;Immunization;Incidence;Lead;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Report;Respiratory Depression;Therapeutics;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vaccines, Conjugate",Bradycardia;Opioid Use Disorder;Respiratory Depression,ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Immunotherapeutics such as vaccines have been investigated as a potential interventional strategy complementary to current pharmacotherapies to reduce the incidence of OUD and opioid-related overdose. Given the importance of targeting structurally distinct fentanyl analogues, this study compared a previously established lead conjugate vaccine (F1-CRM) to a series of novel vaccines incorporating haptens derived from alfentanil and acetylfentanyl (F8, 9a, 9b, 10), and evaluated their efficacy against drug-induced pharmacological effects in rats. While no vaccine tested provided significant protection against alfentanil, lead formulations were effective in reducing antinociception, respiratory depression, and bradycardia elicited by fentanyl, sufentanil, and acetylfentanyl. Compared with control, vaccination with F1-CRM also reduced drug levels in the brain of rats challenged with lethal doses of fentanyl. These data further support investigation of F1-CRM as a candidate vaccine against fentanyl and selected analogues.","Alfentanil;Bradycardia;Brain;Death;Drug Therapy;Emergencies;Fentanyl;Haptens;Incidence;Lead;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Rats;Respiratory Depression;Sufentanil;United States;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vaccines, Conjugate",Bradycardia;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Respiratory Depression,ACS Omega,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35643857,2022,Effects of Daily Methocinnamox Treatment on Fentanyl Self-Administration in Rhesus Monkeys.,"Methocinnamox (MCAM), a long-acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, attenuates the positive reinforcing effects of opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, suggesting it could be an effective treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Because treatment of OUD often involves repeated administration of a medication, this study evaluated effects of daily injections of a relatively small dose of MCAM on fentanyl self-administration and characterized the shift in the fentanyl dose-effect curve. Rhesus monkeys (3 males and 2 females) lever-pressed for intravenous infusions of fentanyl (0.032-10 μg/kg infusion) or cocaine (32-100 μg/kg infusion) under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule. MCAM (0.032 mg/kg) or naltrexone (0.0032-0.032 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously 60 or 15 minutes, respectively, before sessions. When administered acutely, naltrexone and MCAM decreased fentanyl self-administration, with effects of naltrexone lasting less than 24 hours and effects of MCAM lasting for up to 3 days. Daily MCAM treatment attenuated responding for fentanyl, but not cocaine; effects were maintained for the duration of treatment with responding recovering quickly (within 2 days) following discontinuation of treatment. MCAM treatment shifted the fentanyl dose-effect curve in a parallel manner approximately 20-fold to the right. Naltrexone pretreatment decreased fentanyl intake with equal potency before and after MCAM treatment, confirming sensitivity of responding to antagonism by an opioid receptor antagonist. Although antagonist effects of treatment with a relatively small dose were surmountable, MCAM produced sustained and selective attenuation of opioid self-administration, supporting the view that it could be an effective treatment of OUD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioid use disorder and opioid overdose continue to be significant public health challenges despite the availability of effective treatments. Methocinnamox (MCAM) is a long-acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the reinforcing and ventilatory depressant effects of opioids in nonhuman subjects. This study demonstrates that daily treatment with MCAM reliably and selectively decreases fentanyl self-administration, further supporting the potential therapeutic utility of this novel antagonist.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Cinnamates;Cocaine;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Duration of Therapy;Female;Fentanyl;Heroin;Infusions, Intravenous;Injections;Macaca mulatta;Male;Morphine Derivatives;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Public Health;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Schedules;Self Administration;Sensitivity;Therapeutics",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35660222,2022,Objective sleep outcomes in randomized-controlled trials in persons with substance use disorders: A systematic review.,"Improving sleep health is an important target for substance use disorder (SUD) research. However, there is little guidance for SUD researchers regarding the use of technologies to objectively assess sleep outcomes in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review aimed to describe the use of technologies to objectively measure sleep outcomes in RCTs conducted in persons with SUDs, in order to inform future sleep intervention studies in SUD populations. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on May 7th, 2020 (CRD42020182004). RCTs were reviewed here if they were peer-reviewed manuscripts that included objective measures of sleep in RCTs that sought to improve sleep in persons with SUDs. The initial search yielded 13,403 potential articles, with 27 meeting a priori criteria to be included in this review. The most common SUD was alcohol use disorder (59%). The most common technology used to assess sleep was polysomnography (41%), followed by actigraphy (37%), ambulatory polysomnography or components of polysomnography (e.g., electroencephalography; 19%), and at-home sleep apnea testing (7%). The most common sleep outcome reported was total sleep time (96%). There are a range of options to assess objective sleep outcomes. Polysomnography or ambulatory devices that directly measure brain activity are critical to advance medications through the regulatory process for the indication of improving sleep duration, continuity, and/or sleep onset latency outcomes.

The most commonly used measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, and sleep diaries. However, multiple additional sleep assessments were also used, including visual analogue and Likert scales.

35695511,2022,"Acute glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide prevents cue-, stress-, and drug-induced heroin-seeking in rats.","Substance use disorder is challenging to treat due to its relapsing nature. In the last decade, opioid use disorder has been a threat to public health, being declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a tragic situation, considering there currently are only three effective, yet not ideal, treatments to prevent relapse to opioids. Recent research has shown that hormones that modulate hunger and satiety also can modulate motivated behavior for drugs of abuse. For example, the short-acting analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that regulates homeostatic feeding, has been shown to reduce responding for rewarding stimuli such as food, cocaine, heroin, and nicotine when administered over several days or weeks. This may serve as an effective adjuvant during treatment; however, whether it would be effective when used acutely to bridge a patient between cessation of use and onset of medication for the treatment of an opioid addiction is unknown. Here, we tested the acute effects of the longer acting GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, on heroin-seeking. In rats with heroin self-administration experience, we found that subcutaneous administration of an acute dose of 0.3-mg/kg liraglutide was effective in preventing drug-seeking after exposure to three major precipitators: drug-associated cues, stress (yohimbine-induced), and the drug itself. Finally, we confirmed that the reduction in drug-seeking is not due to a locomotor impairment, as liraglutide did not significantly alter performance in a rotarod test. As such, acute use of GLP-1 analogs may serve as a new and effective nonopioid bridge to treatment.","Administration;Animals;Behavior;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Cocaine;Cues;Drug-Seeking Behavior;Epidemics;Food;Glucagon-Like Peptide 1;Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor;Heroin;Hormones;Hunger;Incretins;Liraglutide;Nature;News;Nicotine;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Rats;Relapse;Research;Rotarod Performance Test;Self Administration;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Yohimbine",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse;Substance Use Disorders,Behav Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

This study examined whether a dual-orexin receptor antagonist would improve sleep and withdrawal outcomes when compared with placebo during a buprenorphine/naloxone taper. Thirty-eight participants with opioid use disorder were recruited to a clinical research unit and maintained on 8/2 to 16/4 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment for 3 days before being randomized to 20 mg of suvorexant (n = 14), 40 mg of suvorexant (n = 12), or placebo (n = 12); 26 individuals completed the study. After randomization, participants underwent a 4-day buprenorphine/naloxone taper and 4-day post-taper observation period. Total sleep time (TST) was collected nightly with a wireless electroencephalography device and wrist-worn actigraphy; opioid withdrawal symptoms were assessed via the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS); and abuse potential was assessed on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale of ""High"" every morning. A priori outcomes included two-group (collapsing suvorexant doses versus placebo) and three-group comparisons of area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores for TST, SOWS, and High. In two-group comparisons, participants receiving suvorexant displayed increased TST during the buprenorphine/naloxone taper and decreased SOWS during the post-taper period. In three-group comparisons, participants receiving 20 mg of suvorexant versus placebo displayed increased AUC for TST during the buprenorphine/naloxone taper, but there was no difference in SOWS among groups. There was no evidence of abuse potential in two- or three-group analyses. The results suggest that suvorexant might be a promising treatment for sleep and opioid withdrawal in individuals undergoing a buprenorphine/naloxone taper.","Actigraphy;Analgesics, Opioid;Area Under Curve;Azepines;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Craving;Devices;Double-Blind Method;Drug-Seeking Behavior;Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists;Electroencephalography;Humans;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Observation;Opiate Alkaloids;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Orexins;Placebos;Random Allocation;Research;Scales;Sleep;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;Treatment Outcome;Triazoles;Visual Analog Scale;Withdrawal Symptoms;Wrist",Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,Sci Transl Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
35752252,2022,Transitioning from a lab-scale PLGA microparticle formulation to pilot-scale manufacturing.,"The complexity of scale-up manufacturing of PLGA microparticles creates a significant challenge when transitioning from benchtop-scale formulation development into larger clinical scale batches. Minor changes in the initial formulation composition (e.g., PLGA molecular weight, solvent type, and drug concentration) and processing parameters (e.g., extraction kinetics and drying condition) during scale-up production can result in significantly different performance of the prepared microparticles. The objectives of the present study were to highlight the in vitro and in vivo performance of a candidate benchtop-scale batch created with a rotor-stator mixer, transitioned into an in-line manufacturing process at ~15× scale of a long-acting naltrexone formulation. Physicochemical properties (such as drug loading, residual benzyl alcohol content, and morphology) as well as the in vitro release characteristics of the prepared naltrexone microparticles between the benchtop-scale and in-line process pilot-scale were determined. The pharmacokinetics of the naltrexone microspheres were investigated using the rat model. The results demonstrate that while the morphologies of the particles were different from a visual assessment and slight differences were observed in the in vitro release profiles, the in vivo pharmacokinetics illustrate similar kinetics. Our study shows that scale-up production having the same drug release kinetics can be made by controlling the formulation and processing parameters.",Animals;Benzyl Alcohols;Drug Carriers;Drug Liberation;In Vitro;Kinetics;Lactic Acid;Microspheres;Minors;Molecular Weight;Naltrexone;Particle Size;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacokinetics;Pilots;Polyglycolic Acid;Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer;Production;Rats;Scales;Solvents,,J Control Release,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

The present study investigated the impact of advanced age and biological sex on opioid signaling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the presence of chronic inflammatory pain. Assays measuring μ-opioid receptor (MOR) radioligand binding, GTPγS binding, receptor phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein expression were performed on vlPAG tissue from adult (2-3 months) and aged (16-18 months) male and female rats. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Adult males exhibited the highest MOR binding potential (BP) and highest G-protein activation (activation efficiency ratio) in comparison to aged males and females (adult and aged). No impact of advanced age or sex on MOR phosphorylation state was observed. DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition was highest in the vlPAG of adult males compared with aged males and females (adult and aged). vlPAG levels of RGS4 and RGS9-2, critical for terminating G-protein signaling, were assessed using RNAscope. Adult rats (both males and females) exhibited lower levels of vlPAG RGS4 and RGS9-2 mRNA expression compared with aged males and females. The observed age-related reductions in vlPAG MOR BP, G-protein activation efficiency, and cAMP inhibition, along with the observed age-related increases in RGS4 and RGS9-2 vlPAG expression, provide potential mechanisms whereby the potency of opioids is decreased in the aged population.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOpioids have decreased analgesic potency (but not efficacy) in aged rodents compared with adults; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this attenuated response are not yet known.

Kratom has been widely used for the mitigation of pain and opioid dependence, as a mood enhancer, and/or as an energy booster. Speciociliatine is a partial µ-opioid agonist with a 3-fold higher binding affinity than mitragynine. Speciociliatine has been found to be a major circulating alkaloid in humans following oral administration of a kratom product. In this report, we have characterized the metabolism of speciociliatine in human and preclinical species (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey) liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Speciociliatine metabolized rapidly in monkey, rat, and mouse hepatocytes (in vitro half-life was 6.6 ± 0.2, 8.3 ± 1.1, 11.2 ± 0.7 min, respectively), while a slower metabolism was observed in human and dog hepatocytes (91.7 ± 12.8 and &gt; 120 min, respectively). Speciociliatine underwent extensive metabolism, primarily through monooxidation and O-demethylation metabolic pathways in liver microsomes and hepatocytes across species.

35963210,2022,A novel long-acting formulation of oral buprenorphine/naloxone produces prolonged decreases in fentanyl self-administration by rhesus monkeys.,"Due to the poor oral bioavailability of buprenorphine, an oral formulation has not been thought possible. Lyndra Therapeutics is developing a once-weekly long-acting oral product containing buprenorphine. We evaluated the efficacy of this formulation in reducing intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl self-administration by three male and three female rhesus monkeys. Buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl were co-formulated using an 11:1 ratio of buprenorphine:naloxone in a controlled-release gastric residence formulation administered in an oral capsule (LYN-013). Naloxone was included to determine the feasibility of combining naloxone with buprenorphine in the formulation as an abuse deterrent. Complete fentanyl dose-response functions were determined during each session. The efficacy of single doses of 56/5, 112/10 and 168/15 mg buprenorphine/naloxone in reducing fentanyl self-administration was examined over 13 days. LYN-013 significantly decreased the rate of responding for fentanyl for 3 days and significantly reduced total intake of fentanyl for 8 days. Time to maximal buprenorphine levels (Tmax) ranged between 56 and 68 h for all 3 doses. The maximal buprenorphine level (Cmax) following 168 mg was 2.3 ng/ml which was significantly greater that those observed for 56 mg (1.22 ng/ml) and 112 mg (1.35 ng/ml). Finally, the area-under-curves (AUCtau) were buprenorphine dose-dependently increased from 88 to 127-265 h*ng/ml. There were no signs of non-specific changes in behavior. A once-weekly oral buprenorphine/naloxone formulation produced sustained suppression of fentanyl self-administration in monkeys suggesting that oral delivery of buprenorphine with this formulation could provide a new opportunity to treat opioid use disorders (OUD).","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Area Under Curve;Behavior;Biological Availability;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Capsules;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Development;Female;Fentanyl;Humans;Macaca mulatta;Male;Monkeys;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Primates;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Thought;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
36031011,2022,"Acute treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, reduces cue- and drug-induced fentanyl seeking in rats.","Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder that has severe negative impacts on the individual, the family, and the community at large. In 2021, opioids contributed to nearly 70% of all drug overdose deaths in the United States. This number of opioid related deaths coincides with a significant rise in the use of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 150 times more potent than morphine. Furthermore, this overdose trend has spared no demographic and costs the nation an estimated $51.2 billion annually. Thus, it is imperative to better understand the underlying mechanisms of OUD in an effort to identify new treatment targets. Using animal models, studies have shown that rats readily self-administer heroin and increase seeking following exposure to cues for drug, the drug itself, or stress. We have shown that treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, liraglutide, can reduce heroin taking and seeking behavior in rats. Therefore, using our rodent model, we established a fentanyl self-administration paradigm to test whether acute treatment with the GLP-1R agonist also can reduce fentanyl seeking in fentanyl experienced rats. The results showed that rats readily self-administered fentanyl (2.5 ug/kg) intravenously, with marked individual differences in drug taking behavior. As with other drugs of abuse tested, rats exhibited high seeking behavior when challenged with a drug-related cue or, after a period of extinction, the drug itself. Here, acute treatment with the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), was found to attenuate both cue-induced fentanyl seeking and drug-induced reinstatement of fentanyl seeking with the same efficacy as the currently approved partial opioid agonist, buprenorphine. Taken together, these data suggest that a known satiety signal, GLP-1, may serve as an effective non-opioid alternative for the treatment of OUD.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior;Buprenorphine;Community;Cost;Cues;Death;Demography;Drug Overdose;Family;Fentanyl;Glucagon-Like Peptide 1;Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor;Heroin;Individuality;Liraglutide;Models, Animal;Morphine;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Partial Opioid Agonists;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Rodentia;Self;Self Administration;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Brain Res Bull,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
36038016,2022,"Dose titration with the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, liraglutide, reduces cue- and drug-induced heroin seeking in high drug-taking rats.","Opioid use disorder (OUD), like other substance use disorders (SUDs), is widely understood to be a disorder of persistent relapse. Despite the use of three FDA-approved medications for OUD, typically in conjunction with behavioral treatments, relapse rates remain unacceptably high. Whereas medication assisted therapy (MAT) reduces the risk of opioid overdose mortality, the benefits of MAT are negated when people discontinue the medications. Currently approved medications present barriers to efficient use, including daily visits to a treatment center or work restrictions. With spiking increases in opioid relapse and death, it is imperative to identify new treatments that can reduce the risk of relapse. Recent evidence suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), currently FDA-approved to treat obesity and type two diabetes, may be promising candidates to reduce relapse. GLP-1RAs have been shown to reduce relapse in rats, whether elicited by cues, drug, and/or stress. However, GLP-1RAs also can cause gastrointestinal malaise, and therefore, in humans, the medication typically is titrated up to full dose when initiating treatment. Here, we used a rodent model to test whether cue- and drug-induced heroin seeking can be reduced by the GLP-1RA, liraglutide, when the dose is titrated across the abstinence period and prior to test. The results show this titration regimen is effective in reducing both cue-induced heroin seeking and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking, particularly in rats with a history of high drug-taking. Importantly, this treatment regimen had no effect on either circulating glucose or insulin. GLP-1RAs, then, appear strong candidates for the non-opioid prevention of relapse to opioids.","Animals;Cues;Death;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Glucagon-Like Peptide 1;Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor;Glucose;Heroin;History;Humans;Hypoglycemic Agents;Insulin;Liraglutide;Mortality;News;Obesity;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Recurrence;Relapse;Risk;Rodentia;Self Administration;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Work","Death;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Obesity;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Use Disorders",Brain Res Bull,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Medication for OUD is currently the mainstay of treatment; however, it has limitations and alternative approaches are needed. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation (tcVNS) on behavioral and physiological manifestations of acute opioid withdrawal. Patients with OUD undergoing acute opioid withdrawal were randomly assigned to receive double blind active tcVNS (N = 10) or sham stimulation (N = 11) while watching neutral and opioid cue videos. Subjective opioid withdrawal, opioid craving, and anxiety were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Distress was measured using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), and pain was measured using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain. Electrocardiogram signals were measured to compute heart rate. The primary outcomes of this initial phase of the clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04556552) were heart rate and craving. tcVNS compared to sham resulted in statistically significant reductions in subjective opioid withdrawal (p = .047), pain (p = .045), and distress (p = .004). In addition, tcVNS was associated with lower heart rate compared to sham (p = .026). Craving did not significantly differ between groups (p = .11). tcVNS reduces behavioral and physiological manifestations of opioid withdrawal, and should be evaluated in future studies as a possible non-pharmacologic, easily implemented approach for adjunctive OUD treatment.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Clinical Trial;Craving;Cues;Electrocardiogram;Future;Heart Rate;Humans;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Pilot Projects;Public Health;Scales;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Vagus Nerve Stimulation;Visual Analog Scale",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Brain Stimul,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
36070842,2022,Implications of particle size on the respective solid-state properties of naltrexone in PLGA microparticles.,"A thorough understanding of the complexities in formulating and manufacturing polymeric microspheres is required for new and generic drug applications. Specifically, for an ANDA application for polymeric microsphere-based products, the applicant must meet Q1 (qualitative) and Q2 (quantitative) sameness, and in some cases, Q3 (e.g., microstructural) sameness. Herein, we report the naltrexone crystallinity in a PLGA microparticle system prepared from a dichloromethane-benzyl alcohol solvent system results in a crystallinity dependence as a function of microparticle size from the same batch - illustrating intrabatch microstructural variability. As the particle size increases, the crystallinity increases, with additional polymorphic forms more readily noted at the large particle sizes. Furthermore, during dissolution, a polymorphic transition and/or crystallization occurs at larger size fractions. This study highlights the importance of controlling the manufacturing parameters during microparticle formation, specifically solvent extraction and particle size control. Furthermore, with the approval of generic microparticles formulations on the horizon, this study highlights the importance of Q3, the same components in the same concentration with the same arrangement of matter, whereby microparticles can have varying microstructural properties across particle sizes from the same batch.","Benzyl Alcohols;Comprehension;Crystallization;Drug Carriers;Drug Liberation;Drugs, Generic;Form;Methylene Chloride;Microspheres;Naltrexone;News;Particle Size;Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer;Report;Solvents",,Int J Pharm,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
36153006,2022,Interactive Effects of µ-Opioid and Adrenergic-α 2 Receptor Agonists in Rats: Pharmacological Investigation of the Primary Kratom Alkaloid Mitragynine and Its Metabolite 7-Hydroxymitragynine.,"The primary kratom alkaloid mitragynine is proposed to act through multiple mechanisms, including actions at µ-opioid receptors (MORs) and adrenergic-α 2 receptors (Aα 2Rs), as well as conversion in vivo to a MOR agonist metabolite (i.e., 7-hydroxymitragynine). Aα 2R and MOR agonists can produce antinociceptive synergism. Here, contributions of both receptors to produce mitragynine-related effects were assessed by measuring receptor binding in cell membranes and, in rats, pharmacological behavioral effect antagonism studies. Mitragynine displayed binding affinity at both receptors, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine only displayed MOR binding affinity. Compounds were tested for their capacity to decrease food-maintained responding and rectal temperature and to produce antinociception in a hotplate test. Prototypical MOR agonists and 7-hydroxymitragynine, but not mitragynine, produced antinociception. MOR agonist and 7-hydroxymitragynine rate-deceasing and antinociceptive effects were antagonized by the opioid antagonist naltrexone but not by the Aα 2R antagonist yohimbine. Hypothermia only resulted from reference Aα 2R agonists. The rate-deceasing and hypothermic effects of reference Aα 2R agonists were antagonized by yohimbine but not naltrexone. Neither naltrexone nor yohimbine antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of mitragynine. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine increased the potency of the antinociceptive effects of Aα 2R but not MOR reference agonists. Only mitragynine produced hypothermic effects. Isobolographic analyses for the rate-decreasing effects of the reference Aα 2R and MOR agonists were also conducted. These results suggest mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine may produce antinociceptive synergism with Aα 2R and MOR agonists. When combined with Aα 2R agonists, mitragynine could also produce hypothermic synergism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mitragynine is proposed to target the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) and adrenergic-α2 receptor (Aα2R) and to produce behavioral effects through conversion to its MOR agonist metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine. Isobolographic analyses indicated supra-additivity in some dose ratio combinations. This study suggests mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine may produce antinociceptive synergism with Aα2R and MOR agonists. When combined with Aα2R agonists, mitragynine could also produce hypothermic synergism.","Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists;Alkaloids;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Cell Membrane;Food;Hypothermia;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioids;Rats;Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Temperature;Yohimbine",Hypothermia,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
36166409,2022,Scanning Analysis of Sequential Semisolvent Vapor Impact To Study Naltrexone Release from Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) Microparticles.,"Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-based microparticle formulations have been a mainstay of long-acting injectable drug delivery applications for decades. Despite a long history of use, tools and techniques to analyze and understand these formulations are still under development. Recently, a new characterization method was introduced known as the surface analysis after sequential semisolvent impact using sequential semisolvent vapors. The vapor-based technique is named, for convenience, surface analysis of (semisolvent) vapor impact (SAVI). In the SAVI method, discretely controlled quantities of selected organic semisolvents in the vapor phase were applied to PLGA microparticles to track particle morphological changes by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Subsequently, the morphological images were analyzed to calculate mean peak height (Sa), core height (Sk), kurtosis (Sku), dale void volume (Vvv), the density of peaks (Spd), maximum height (Hm), and the shape ratio (Rs). Here, the SAVI method was applied to naltrexone-loaded microparticles manufactured internally and Vivitrol, a commercial formulation. SAVI analysis of these microparticles indicated that the two primary mechanisms controlling the naltrexone release were the formation of discrete, self-crystallized portions of naltrexone within the PLGA structure and the degradation of PLGA chains through nucleophilic substitution. The relatively higher amounts of naltrexone crystals resulted in prolonged release than lower amounts of crystals. Data from gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and in vitro release measurements all point to the importance of naltrexone crystal formation. This study highlights the utility of SAVI for gaining further insights into the microstructure of PLGA formulations and using SAVI data to support research, product development, and quality control applications for microparticle formulations of pharmaceuticals.","Calorimetry, Differential Scanning;Chromatography, Gel;Drug Delivery Systems;History;In Vitro;Injectables;Methods;Microscopy, Confocal, Laser Scanning;Microspheres;Naltrexone;News;Particle Size;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poly(Lactide-Co-Glycoside);Polyglactin 910;Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer;Quality Control;Research;Self;Solvents;Track",,Mol Pharm,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Functional activity was obtained by forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation assays and several compounds were examined in the [35S]GTPgS assay and in an assay for respiratory depression. In each of the four sets, similarities and differences were observed dependent on the length of their C9-alkenyl chain and, most importantly, their stereochemistry. Three MOR antagonists were found to be as or more potent than naltrexone and, unlike naltrexone, none had MOR, KOR, or DOR agonist activity. Several potent MOR full agonists were obtained, and, of particular interest partial agonists were found that exhibited less respiratory depression than that caused by morphine. The effect of stereochemistry and the length of the C9-alkenyl chain was also explored using molecular modeling. The MOR antagonists were found to interact with the inactive (4DKL) MOR crystal structures and agonists were found to interact with the active (6DDF) MOR crystal structures. The comparison of their binding modes at the mouse MOR was used to gain insight into the structural basis for their stereochemically induced pharmacological differences.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Animals;CHO Cells;Colforsin;Cricetinae;In Vitro;Ligands;Mice;Morphine;Naltrexone;Phenols;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency",Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency,Molecules,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,

Studying interactions between 5-HT2A receptor agonists and other drugs is important for understanding potential therapeutic effects as well as adverse interactions. Direct-acting 5-HT2A receptor agonists such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) and 2-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline (quipazine) enhance some (e.g., antinociceptive) effects of opioids; however, it is unclear whether they alter the abuse-related effects of opioids. This study examined whether DOM and quipazine alter the reinforcing effects of fentanyl in rhesus monkeys (n = 6) responding under a food versus drug choice procedure. Responding on one lever delivered sucrose pellets and responding on the other lever delivered intravenous (i.v.) infusions. In one set of experiments, fentanyl (0.1-3.2 µg/kg/infusion) versus food choice sessions were preceded by noncontingent i.v. pretreatments with DOM (0032-0.32 mg/kg), quipazine (0.32-1.0 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg), or heroin (0.1 mg/kg). In another set of experiments, fentanyl was available during choice sessions in combination with DOM (0.32-100 µg/kg/infusion) or quipazine (3.2-320 µg/kg/infusion) in varying dose ratios. Naltrexone decreased and heroin increased fentanyl choice, demonstrating sensitivity of responding to pharmacological manipulation. However, whether given as a pretreatment or made available in combination with fentanyl as a mixture, neither DOM nor quipazine significantly altered fentanyl choice. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor agonists do not enhance the reinforcing effects of opioids and, thus, will not likely enhance abuse potential. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Serotonin 2A subtype receptor agonists enhance some (e.g., antinociceptive) effects of opioids, suggesting they could be combined with opioids in some therapeutic contexts such as treating pain. However, it is unclear whether they also enhance adverse effects of opioids, including abuse. Results of this study indicate that serotonin 2A subtype receptor agonists do not reliably enhance opioid self-administration and, thus, are unlikely to enhance the abuse potential of opioids.","2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Comprehension;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Fentanyl;Food;Hallucinogens;Heroin;Macaca mulatta;Methamphetamine;Naltrexone;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Procedures;Quinolines;Quipazine;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A;Self Administration;Sensitivity;Serotonin;Substance Use Disorders;Sucrose;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics",Pain;Substance Use Disorders,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34801670,2022,Does weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing pain reflect different pain mechanisms in knee osteoarthritis?: the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST).,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is predominantly characterized by pain with weight-bearing activities. Pain at rest also occurs but the mechanisms for this are not clear. We evaluated the relations of nociceptive signal alterations to weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing pain in knee OA. We used data from a NIH-funded longitudinal cohort of older adults with or at risk of knee OA. We evaluated quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures (pressure pain threshold (PPT) at patellae and the wrist; mechanical temporal summation (TS); conditioned pain modulation (CPM)). Each WOMAC pain question was dichotomized as having at least moderate pain, and we further categorized them as weight-bearing pain and non-weight-bearing pain. We evaluated the relation of QST measures to each pain outcome using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. 2,749 participants (5,479 knees) were included (mean age 64 ± 11, 57% female). Each SD unit decrease in patellar PPT was associated with greater odds of both weight-bearing pain (OR 1.51 (95% CI 1.27, 1.79)) and non-weight-bearing pain (OR 1.46 (1.20-1.77)), while wrist PPT was associated with greater odds of weight-bearing pain (OR 1.27 (1.15, 1.39)) but only with pain during sitting/lying (OR 1.20 (1.01, 1.43)). TS was significantly associated with greater odds of pain with walking and stairs (OR 1.11 (1.01, 1.23), 1.11 (1.03, 1.20), respectively). CPM was not associated with any pain outcomes. Our findings challenge the hypothesis that non-weight-bearing pain may reflect greater pain sensitization and/or inefficient CPM than weight-bearing pain in knee OA, suggesting other mechanisms are likely responsible.","Adult;Aged;Arthralgia;Female;Humans;Knee;Knee Joint;Logistic Regression;Lying;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain;Pain Threshold;Pressure;Rest;Risk;Sitting;Walking;Weight-Bearing;Wrist","Arthralgia;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain",Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
35137553,2022,Associations of Body Mass Index With Pain and the Mediating Role of Inflammatory Biomarkers in People With Hand Osteoarthritis.,"To examine the association of body mass index (BMI) with pain in people with hand osteoarthritis (OA), and explore whether this association, if causal, is mediated by systemic inflammatory biomarkers. In 281 Nor-Hand study participants, we estimated associations between BMI and hand pain, as measured by the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN; range 0-20) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; range 0-10); foot pain, as measured by NRS (range 0-10); knee/hip pain, as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; range 0-20); painful total body joint count; and pain sensitization. We fit natural-effects models to estimate natural direct and natural indirect effects of BMI on pain through inflammatory biomarkers. Each 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with more severe hand pain (on average increased AUSCAN by 0.64 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.23, 1.08]), foot pain (on average increased NRS by 0.65 [95% CI 0.36, 0.92]), knee/hip pain (on average increased WOMAC by 1.31 [95% CI 0.87, 1.73]), generalized pain, and pain sensitization. Mediation analyses suggested that the effects of BMI on hand pain and painful total body joint count were partially mediated by leptin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), respectively. Effect sizes for mediation by leptin were larger for the hands than for the lower extremities, and were statistically significant for the hands only. In people with hand OA, higher BMI is associated with greater pain severity in the hands, feet, and knees/hips. Systemic effects of obesity, measured by leptin, may play a larger mediating role for pain in the hands than in the lower extremities. Low-grade inflammation, measured by hsCRP, may contribute to generalized pain in overweight/obese individuals.","Arthralgia;Association;Australia;Biomarkers;Body Mass Index;C-Reactive Protein;Canada;Confidence Intervals;Foot;Hand;Hip;Humans;Index;Inflammation;Joints;Knee;Leptin;Lower Extremity;Mediating;Mediation Analysis;Negotiating;Obesity;Ontario;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Overweight;Pain;Persons;Play;Role;Scales;Universities","Arthralgia;Inflammation;Obesity;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Overweight;Pain",Arthritis Rheumatol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

Findings from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network Symptom Pattern Study.,"Of women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome 85% have concomitant pelvic floor muscle tenderness (PFT). The significance of this finding is incompletely understood. This study examines PFT among participants in the MAPP (Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain) Research Network and its relationship with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) symptom severity in order to determine whether this is a phenotypic predictor in UCPPS. Participants in the MAPP Network Symptom Patterns Study underwent a standardized pelvic examination (PEX). Trained examiners palpated 6 locations evaluating the pelvic musculature for PFT. Participants were assigned a 0 to 6 PEX score based on the number of areas with tenderness on PEX. Using regression tree models, PEX scores were divided into low (0, 1), mid (2, 3, 4, 5) and high (6). The relationship between PFT and UCPPS symptoms was examined using several validated questionnaires. The study cohort consisted of 562 UCCPS participants (375 females and 187 males) and 69 controls. Diagnoses included interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (397), chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (122), both (34) or no diagnosis (9). Of UCPPS participants 81% had PFT on PEX compared to 9% of controls: 107 (19%) low, 312 (56%) mid and 143 (25%) high. Participants with higher PFT scores had more severe disease burden (worse pelvic pain and urinary symptoms), worse quality of life and more widespread distribution of nonpelvic pain. UCPPS patients with more widespread PFT have severe pain and urinary symptoms, worse quality of life and a more centralized pain phenotype.","Chronic Pain;Chronic Prostatitis with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome;Cohort Studies;Cost of Illness;Cystitis;Cystitis, Interstitial;Diagnosis;Female;Humans;Male;Men;Muscle Tenderness;Myalgia;Pain;Painful Bladder Syndrome;Patients;Pelvic Examination;Pelvic Floor;Pelvic Pain;Phenotype;Prostatitis;Quality of Life;Questionnaires;Research;Syndrome;Trees;Women","Chronic Pain;Chronic Prostatitis with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome;Cystitis;Cystitis, Interstitial;Muscle Tenderness;Myalgia;Pain;Painful Bladder Syndrome;Pelvic Pain;Prostatitis;Syndrome",J Urol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

Community engagement can improve the uptake and sustainability of evidence-based practices. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) aims to reduce opioid overdose deaths through the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention, a community-engaged, data-driven planning process that will be implemented in 67 communities across four states. An iterative process was used in the development of the community engagement component of the CTH. The resulting community engagement process uses phased planning steeped in the principles of community based participatory research. Phases include: 0) Preparation, 1) Getting Started, 2) Getting Organized, 3) Community Profiles and Data Dashboards, 4) Community Action Planning, 5) Implementation and Monitoring, and 6) Sustainability Planning. The CTH protocol provides a common structure across the four states for the community-engaged intervention and allows for tailored approaches that meet the unique needs or sociocultural context of each community. Challenges inherent to community engagement work emerged early in the process are discussed. HCS will show how community engagement can support the implementation of evidence-based practices for addressing the opioid crisis in highly impacted communities. Findings from this study have the potential to provide communities across the country with an evidence-based approach to address their local opioid crisis; advance community engaged research; and contribute to the implementation, sustainability, and adoption of evidence-based practices.

33070058,2020,Community dashboards to support data-informed decision-making in the HEALing communities study.,"With opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose deaths persisting at epidemic levels in the U.S., the largest implementation study in addiction research-the HEALing Communities Study (HCS)-is evaluating the impact of the Communities That Heal (CTH) intervention on reducing opioid overdose deaths in 67 disproportionately affected communities from four states (i.e., ""sites""). Community-tailored dashboards are central to the CTH intervention's mandate to implement a community-engaged and data-driven process. These dashboards support a participating community's decision-making for selection and monitoring of evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. A community-tailored dashboard is a web-based set of interactive data visualizations of community-specific metrics. Metrics include opioid overdose deaths and other OUD-related measures, as well as drivers of change of these outcomes in a community. Each community-tailored dashboard is a product of a co-creation process between HCS researchers and stakeholders from each community. The four research sites used a varied set of technical approaches and solutions to support the scientific design and CTH intervention implementation. Ongoing evaluation of the dashboards involves quantitative and qualitative data on key aspects posited to shape dashboard use combined with website analytics. The HCS presents an opportunity to advance how community-tailored dashboards can foster community-driven solutions to address the opioid epidemic. Lessons learned can be applied to inform interventions for public health concerns and issues that have disproportionate impact across communities and populations (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities and other marginalized individuals).

33075691,2020,Addressing opioid overdose deaths: The vision for the HEALing communities study.,"The United States is facing two devastating public health crises- the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this context, one of the most ambitious implementation studies in addiction research is moving forward. Launched in May 2019, the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative (National Institutes of Health, 2020). The goal for this research was to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 40 % in three years by enhancing and integrating the delivery of multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) with proven effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose deaths across health care, justice, and community settings. This paper describes the initial vision, goals, and objectives of this initiative; the impact of COVID-19; and the potential for knowledge to be generated from HCS at the intersection of an unrelenting epidemic of opioid misuse and overdoses and the ravishing COVID-19 pandemic.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Community;Death;Epidemics;Evidence-Based Practice;Goals;Health Care;Humans;Justice;Knowledge;Mental Health Services;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Paper;Public Health;Research;Substance Abuse;United States;United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration;Vision, Ocular",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33086156,2020,Model and approach for assessing implementation context and fidelity in the HEALing Communities Study.,"In response to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM) Communities Study (HCS) is a multisite, wait-listed, community-level cluster-randomized trial that aims to test the novel Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention, in 67 communities. CTH will expand an integrated set of evidence-based practices (EBPs) across health care, behavioral health, justice, and other community-based settings to reduce opioid overdose deaths. We present the rationale for and adaptation of the RE-AIM/PRISM framework and methodological approach used to capture the CTH implementation context and to evaluate implementation fidelity. HCS measures key domains of the internal and external CTH implementation context with repeated annual surveys and qualitative interviews with community coalition members and key stakeholders. Core constructs of fidelity include dosage, adherence, quality, and program differentiation-the adaptation of the CTH intervention to fit each community's needs. Fidelity measures include a monthly CTH checklist, collation of artifacts produced during CTH activities, coalition and workgroup attendance, and coalition meeting minutes. Training and technical assistance delivered by the research sites to the communities are tracked monthly. To help attenuate the nation's opioid epidemic, the adoption of EBPs must be increased in communities. The HCS represents one of the largest and most complex implementation research experiments yet conducted. Our systematic examination of implementation context and fidelity will significantly advance understanding of how to best evaluate community-level implementation of EBPs and assess relations among implementation context, fidelity, and intervention impact.","Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Artifacts;Behavior, Addictive;Checklist;Classification;Clinical Trials as Topic;Community;Comprehension;Death;Delivery of Health Care;Evidence-Based Practice;Health;Health Care;Humans;Interview;Justice;Measures;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Program;Research;Surveys",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33091842,2020,The Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA): Evidence-based practices in the HEALing Communities Study.,"The number of opioid-involved overdose deaths in the United States remains a national crisis. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) will test whether Communities That HEAL (CTH), a community-engaged intervention, can decrease opioid-involved deaths in intervention communities (n = 33), relative to wait-list communities (n = 34), from four states. The CTH intervention seeks to facilitate widespread implementation of three evidence-based practices (EBPs) with the potential to reduce opioid-involved overdose fatalities: overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND), effective delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and safer opioid analgesic prescribing. A key challenge was delineating an EBP implementation approach useful for all HCS communities. A workgroup composed of EBP experts from HCS research sites used literature reviews and expert consensus to: 1) compile strategies and associated resources for implementing EBPs primarily targeting individuals 18 and older; and 2) determine allowable community flexibility in EBP implementation. The workgroup developed the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA) to organize EBP strategies and resources to facilitate EBP implementation. The ORCCA includes required and recommended EBP strategies, priority populations, and community settings. Each EBP has a ""menu"" of strategies from which communities can select and implement with a minimum of five strategies required: one for OEND, three for MOUD, and one for prescription opioid safety. Identification and engagement of high-risk populations in OEND and MOUD is an ORCCArequirement. To ensure CTH has community-wide impact, implementation of at least one EBP strategy is required in healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal justice settings, with communities identifying particular organizations to engage in HCS-facilitated EBP implementation.","Analgesics, Opioid;Clinical Trials as Topic;Community;Consensus;Continuity of Patient Care;Criminal Justice;Death;Delivery of Health Care;Drug Overdose;Education;Evidence-Based Practice;Health;Health Care;Humans;Literature;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Pliability;Population;Prescriptions;Relatives;Research;Resources;Review;Risk;Safety;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33091843,2020,Introduction to the special issue on the HEALing Communities Study.,"The severity of the overdose epidemic underscores the urgent need for innovative and high impact interventions that promote the rapid penetration and scale up of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in communities profoundly affected by fatal opioid overdose. This special issue shares scientific advancements in implementation research design and evaluation of a novel data-driven community-based intervention. The HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a four-year study that is designed to examine the effectiveness of the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The CTH intervention supports the dissemination of EBPs in 67 communities across four high-burdened states-Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The diversity in these communities in terms of rural-urban status, race-ethnicity and other social determinants of health facilitates generalizability of results to other communities across the US. The nine papers in this special issue describe critical elements that constitute the HCS framework and design. This includes the implementation of EBPs that have a substantial impact on fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach, communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma against people with OUD and MOUD interventions, and the process of community engagement. This includes how to form community coalitions and gain their commitment, and steps taken to mobilize coalitions to pursue EBP implementation and ensure EBPs are adapted for community needs. The collective papers in this issue demonstrate that the design of any complex study must adapt to unanticipated temporal events, including the rapidly emerging COVID-19 crisis. Readers will learn about the scientific process of the design and implementation of a community-engaged intervention, its methodologies, guiding conceptual models, and research implementation strategies that can be applied to address other health issues.",Address;Awareness;Behavior Therapy;COVID-19;Communication;Community;Community Health Services;Continuity of Patient Care;Drug Overdose;Elements;Epidemics;Ethnic Groups;Evidence-Based Practice;Form;Health;Humans;Implementation Science;Kentucky;Massachusetts;Needs;New York;Ohio;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Paper;Persons;Racial Stocks;Research;Research Design;Scales;Social Determinants of Health;Substance-Related Disorders,COVID-19;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33091844,2020,Operationalizing and selecting outcome measures for the HEALing Communities Study.,"The Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM (HEALing) Communities Study (HCS) is a multisite, parallel-group, cluster randomized wait-list controlled trial evaluating the impact of the Communities That HEAL intervention to reduce opioid overdose deaths and associated adverse outcomes. This paper presents the approach used to define and align administrative data across the four research sites to measure key study outcomes. Priority was given to using administrative data and established data collection infrastructure to ensure reliable, timely, and sustainable measures and to harmonize study outcomes across the HCS sites. The research teams established multiple data use agreements and developed technical specifications for more than 80 study measures. The primary outcome, number of opioid overdose deaths, will be measured from death certificate data. Three secondary outcome measures will support hypothesis testing for specific evidence-based practices known to decrease opioid overdose deaths: (1) number of naloxone units distributed in HCS communities; (2) number of unique HCS residents receiving Food and Drug Administration-approved buprenorphine products for treatment of opioid use disorder; and (3) number of HCS residents with new incidents of high-risk opioid prescribing. The HCS has already made an impact on existing data capacity in the four states. In addition to providing data needed to measure study outcomes, the HCS will provide methodology and tools to facilitate data-driven responses to the opioid epidemic, and establish a central repository for community-level longitudinal data to help researchers and public health practitioners study and understand different aspects of the Communities That HEAL framework.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trials as Topic;Community;Data Collection;Death;Death Certificates;Evidence-Based Practice;Humans;Measures;Naloxone;News;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Outcome Measures;Outcome Studies;Paper;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Public Health;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Risk;Therapeutics;United States Food and Drug Administration",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33152672,2020,"Health economic design for cost, cost-effectiveness and simulation analyses in the HEALing Communities Study.","The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is designed to implement and evaluate the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention, a conceptually driven framework to assist communities in selecting and adopting evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. The goal of the HCS is to produce generalizable information for policy makers and community stakeholders seeking to implement CTH or a similar community intervention. To support this objective, one aim of the HCS is a health economics study (HES), the results of which will inform decisions around fiscal feasibility and sustainability relevant to other community settings. The HES is integrated into the HCS design: an unblinded, multisite, parallel arm, cluster randomized, wait list-controlled trial of the CTH intervention implemented in 67 communities in four U.S. states: Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The objectives of the HES are to estimate the economic costs to communities of implementing and sustaining CTH; estimate broader societal costs associated with CTH; estimate the cost-effectiveness of CTH for overdose deaths avoided; and use simulation modeling to evaluate the short- and long-term health and economic impact of CTH, including future overdose deaths avoided and quality-adjusted life years saved, and to develop a simulation policy tool for communities that seek to implement CTH or a similar community intervention.

33152673,2020,Health communication campaigns to drive demand for evidence-based practices and reduce stigma in the HEALing communities study.,"The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is testing whether the Communities that Heal (CTH) intervention can decrease opioid overdose deaths through the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in highly impacted communities. One of the CTH intervention components is a series of communications campaigns to promote the implementation of EBPs, increase demand for naloxone and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and decrease stigma toward people with opioid use disorder and the use of EBPs, especially MOUD. This paper describes the approach to developing and executing these campaigns. The HCS communication campaigns are developed and implemented through a collaboration between communication experts, research site staff, and community coalitions using a three-stage process. The Prepare phase identifies priority groups to receive campaign messages, develops content for those messages, and identifies a ""call to action"" that asks people to engage in a specific behavior. In the Plan phase, campaign resources are produced, and community coalitions develop plans to distribute campaign materials. During the Implement stage, these distribution plans guide delivery of content to priority groups. Fidelity measures assess how community coalitions follow their distribution plan as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation. An evaluation of the communication campaigns is planned. If successful, the Prepare-Plan-Implement process, and the campaign materials, could be adapted and used by other communities to address the opioid crisis. The campaign evaluation will extend the evidence base for how communication campaigns can be developed and implemented through a community-engaged process to effectively address public health crises.",Address;Behavior;Clinical Trials as Topic;Communication;Community;Death;Drive;Evidence-Based Practice;Health Communication;Health Promotion;Humans;Measures;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paper;Persons;Public Health;Research;Resources;Social Stigma,Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The primary aim of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is to determine the impact of an intervention consisting of community-engaged, data-driven selection, and implementation of an integrated set of evidence-based practices (EBPs) on reducing opioid overdose deaths. The HCS is a four year multi-site, parallel-group, cluster randomized wait-list controlled trial. Communities (n = 67) in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York and Ohio are randomized to active intervention (Wave 1), which starts the intervention in Year 1 or the wait-list control (Wave 2), which starts the intervention in Year 3. The HCS will test a conceptually driven framework to assist communities in selecting and adopting EBPs with three components: 1) a community engagement strategy with local coalitions to guide and implement the intervention; 2) a compendium of EBPs coupled with technical assistance; and 3) a series of communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma. An implementation science framework guides the intervention and allows for examination of the multilevel contexts that promote or impede adoption and expansion of EBPs. The primary outcome, number of opioid overdose deaths, will be compared between Wave 1 and Wave 2 communities during Year 2 of the intervention for Wave 1. Numerous secondary outcomes will be examined. The HCS is the largest community-based implementation study in the field of addiction with an ambitious goal of significantly reducing fatal opioid overdoses.","Adoption;Awareness;Behavior, Addictive;Clinical Trial Protocols as Topic;Communication;Community;Death;Drug Overdose;Evidence-Based Practice;Goals;Humans;Implementation Science;Kentucky;Massachusetts;Naloxone;New York;Ohio;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

35125253,2022,Community coalition and key stakeholder perceptions of the community opioid epidemic before an intensive community-level intervention.,"Opioid overdoses are a major public health emergency in the United States. Despite effective treatments that can save lives, access to and utilization of such treatments are limited. Community context plays an important role in addressing treatment barriers and increasing access. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is a multisite community-level cluster-randomized trial that will study implementation and outcomes of a community coalition-based intervention (Communities that HEAL [CTH]) that implements evidence-based practices (EBPs) to reduce opioid overdose deaths in four states. To examine contextual factors critical to understanding implementation, we assessed the perspectives of community members about their communities, current substance use-related services, and other important issues that could impact intervention implementation. Researchers conducted 382 semi-structured qualitative interviews in the HCS communities. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed; researchers subsequently analyzed data using directed content analysis based on the constructs of the RE-AIM/PRISM implementation science framework to identify key themes within the external community context. Despite the diversity in states and communities, four similar themes related to the external community context emerged across communities: These themes included the importance of understanding: 1) community risk perceptions, 2) levels of stigma, 3) the health services environment and the availability of substance use services, and 4) funding for substance use services. Understanding and addressing the external community context in which the CTH intervention and EBPs are implemented are crucial for successful health services-related and community engaged interventions. While implementing EBPs is a challenging undertaking, doing so will help us to understand if and how a community-based intervention can successfully reduce opioid overdose deaths and influence both community beliefs and the community treatment landscape.","Analgesics, Opioid;Beliefs;Community;Comprehension;Death;Emergencies;Environment;Evidence-Based Practice;Health Services;Humans;Implementation Science;Interview;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Perception;Play;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;United States",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35151024,2022,Exploring perspectives on changing opioid prescribing practices: A qualitative study of community stakeholders in the HEALing Communities Study.,"Community-based perspectives are needed to more broadly inform policy-makers, public health practitioners, prescribers, and pharmacists about community-led and broader efforts to reduce opioid overprescribing, and ultimately reduce prescription opioid use disorder, overdoses and fatalities. The aim of this study is to explore community-based perspectives on efforts to change opioid prescribing practices in their communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 388 community stakeholders across four states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio) from November 2019 to January 2020 about community approaches and goals of community-led responses to the opioid crisis. Data analysis combined deductive and inductive approaches to identify themes and sub-themes related to improving opioid prescribing practices. Three major themes and different subthemes were characterized: (1) acknowledging progress (i.e., healthcare providers being part of the solution, provider education, and prescription drug monitoring programs); (2) emergent challenges (i.e., physician nonadherence with safer opioid prescribing guidelines, difficulty identifying appropriate use of opioids, and concerns about accelerating the progression from opioid misuse to drug abuse); and (3) opportunities for change (i.e., educating patients about safer use and proper disposal of opioids, expanding prescriber and pharmacist education, changing unrealistic expectations around eliminating pain, expanding and increasing insurance coverage for alternative treatment options). Community stakeholders appeared to support specific opportunities to reduce prescription opioid misuse and improve safer prescribing. The opportunities included culture change around pain expectations, awareness of safe disposal, additional provider education, and increased coverage and acceptability of non-opioid treatments.","Analgesics, Opioid;Awareness;Community;Culture;Data Analysis;Drug Abuse;Education;Expectations;Goals;Guideline;Health Personnel;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Interview;Kentucky;Massachusetts;New York;Ohio;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Pharmacists;Physicians;Policy Makers;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Public Health;Solutions;Therapeutics",Drug Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36123106,2022,"Protocol for community-driven selection of strategies to implement evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdoses in the HEALing Communities Study: a trial to evaluate a community-engaged intervention in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York and Ohio.","Opioid-involved overdose deaths continue to surge in many communities, despite numerous evidence-based practices (EBPs) that exist to prevent them. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was launched to develop and test an intervention (ie, Communities That HEAL (CTH)) that supports communities in expanding uptake of EBPs to reduce opioid-involved overdose deaths. This paper describes a protocol for a process foundational to the CTH intervention through which community coalitions select strategies to implement EBPs locally. The CTH is being implemented in 67 communities (randomised to receive the intervention) in four states in partnership with coalitions (one per community). Coalitions must select at least five strategies, including one to implement each of the following EBPs: (a) overdose education and naloxone distribution; expanded (b) access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), (c) linkage to MOUD, (d) retention in MOUD and (e) safer opioid prescribing/dispensing. Facilitated by decision aid tools, the community action planning process includes (1) data-driven goal setting, (2) discussion and prioritisation of EBP strategies, (3) selection of EBP strategies and (4) identification of next steps. Following review of epidemiologic data and information on existing local services, coalitions set goals and discuss, score and/or rank EBP strategies based on feasibility, appropriateness within the community context and potential impact on reducing opioid-involved overdose deaths with a focus on three key sectors (healthcare, behavioural health and criminal justice) and high-risk/vulnerable populations. Coalitions then select EBP strategies through consensus or majority vote and, subsequently, suggest or choose agencies with which to partner for implementation. The HCS protocol was approved by a central Institutional Review Board (Advarra). Results of the action planning process will be disseminated in academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals, online and print media, and in meetings with community stakeholders.

36469995,2023,The prevalence of opioid use disorder in Kentucky's counties: A two-year multi-sample capture-recapture analysis.,"Kentucky has one of the highest opioid overdose mortality rates in the United States. Accurate estimates of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are critical to plan for the scope of interventions required to reduce overdose and opioid misuse. Commonly used household surveys are known to underestimate OUD at the state-level and do not provide county-level estimates. We performed a multi-sample capture-recapture analysis to estimate OUD prevalence in Kentucky in 2018 and 2019. We utilized four statewide datasets that were linked at the individual level: 1) Registry of Vital Statistics, 2) Emergency Medical Services (EMS), 3) Kentucky's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), and 4) Kentucky Medicaid. We included persons aged 18-64 years who resided in Kentucky between 2018 and 2019. We identified individuals with administrative data consistent with OUD in each of the datasets, including a fatal opioid-involved overdose (Vital Statistics), EMS runs for suspected opioid overdose, receipt of buprenorphine for OUD treatment (PDMP), or Medicaid claims for OUD. Observed and estimated counts of OUD cases and prevalence of OUD among the adult population in Kentucky. The estimated statewide OUD prevalence was 5.5 % and 5.9 % for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ranging from 1.3 % to 17.7 % across Kentucky counties. As expected, counties with the highest OUD rates were Appalachian counties (eastern area) of the state. Our analysis reveals a substantially larger proportion of KY residents have OUD than previously estimated. Our approach offers a model for states needing county-level estimates of OUD.","Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Dataset;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Emergency Medical Services;Epidemiology;Households;Humans;Kentucky;Medicaid;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Population;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prevalence;Registries;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States;Vital Statistics",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36643788,2023,The policy landscape for naloxone distribution in four states highly impacted by fatal opioid overdoses.,"Expanding access to naloxone is one of the most impactful interventions in decreasing opioid-related mortality. However, state distribution rates of naloxone are insufficient to meet community need. The current study sought to better understand this gap by focusing on state policies that may facilitate or impede naloxone distribution in four states highly impacted by fatal opioid overdoses - Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. We provide a descriptive analysis of the policy landscape impacting naloxone distribution through pharmacy and community channels in the four states participating in the HEALing Communities Study (HCS). Publicly available data and the expertise of the research team were used to describe each state's naloxone access laws (NALs), Medicaid coverage of naloxone, and community overdose education and naloxone distribution infrastructure. Data presented in this study represent the most current policy landscape through September 2022. Variation exists between specific components of the NALs of each state, the structure of Medicaid coverage of naloxone, and the community distribution infrastructure networks. Massachusetts and New York have a statewide standing order, but other states use different strategies short of a statewide standing order to expand access to naloxone. Quantity limits specific to naloxone may limit access to Medicaid beneficiaries in some states. States participating in the HCS have developed innovative but different mechanisms to ensure naloxone access. Policies were dynamic and moved towards greater access.

31320466,2019,Cognitive and Behavioral Impact on Children Exposed to Opioids During Pregnancy.,"The developmental impact of opioid use during pregnancy is a subject of ongoing debate. Short-term neonatal outcomes, such as lower birth weight and neonatal abstinence syndrome, are the most well-recognized outcomes. However, knowledge gaps exist regarding longer-term neurocognitive and mental health outcomes. In this article, we summarize an expert panel discussion that was held in April 2018 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and attended by national experts in the field of perinatal opioid exposure and its impact on child development. Despite the challenges with research in this area, there is emerging literature revealing an association between neonates exposed to opioids in utero and longer-term adverse neurocognitive, behavioral, and developmental outcomes. Although adverse sequalae may not be apparent in the neonatal period, they may become more salient as children develop and reach preschool and school age. Multiple variables (genetic, environmental, and biological) result in a highly complex picture. The next steps and strategies to support families impacted by opioid use disorder are explored. Model programs are also considered, including integrated care for the child and mother, parenting supports, and augmentations to home visiting.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Biopharmaceuticals;Birth Weight;Child;Child Behavior;Child Development;Cognition;Congresses as Topic;Family;Female;Genetics;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Knowledge;Literature;Male;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;Mothers;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Parenting;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Program;Research;Schools;Substance Abuse;United States;United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Substance Abuse,Pediatrics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,

The current study aimed to investigate the extent to which prenatal substance exposure (alcohol, opioids) impacts infant self-regulation during a relational stressor and the association between self-regulation and infant affect. Participants were 100 mother-child dyads recruited prenatally (Mean = 23.8 gestational weeks) and completed the Still Face Paradigm (SFP) when infants were 5 to 8 months of age (Mean = 6.9 months) as part of an ENRICH prospective birth cohort study. Based on prospective repeated assessment of maternal substance use in pregnancy, infants were grouped into: 1) Unexposed controls; 2) Alcohol-exposed; 3) Opioid-exposed due to maternal use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with or without other opioids; 4) MOUD and alcohol. Infant stress reactivity (negative affect) and self-regulation were assessed during the validated 5-episode SFP. Mixed effects linear models were used to analyze differences in the percent of self-regulation and percent of negative affect among the study groups across SFP episodes, as well as the group-by-self-regulation interaction with respect to infant negative affect. The MOUD+Alcohol group demonstrated significantly lower self-regulation at baseline compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant group-by-self-regulation interaction (p = 0.028). Higher self-regulation was associated with lower negative affect across SFP episodes in the MOUD+Alcohol group (p = 0.025) but not other groups. Self-regulation skills are particularly important for emotional modulation in infants with prenatal polysubstance exposure, highlighting the development of these skills as a promising intervention target.","Adult;Affect;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Association;Case-Control Studies;Child;Cohort Studies;Emotions;Face;Female;Humans;Infant;Linear Models;Male;Maternal Behavior;Mothers;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Parturition;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Psychology, Child;Respect;Risk;Self;Self-Control;Substance Use",Alcoholism;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Substance Use,Early Hum Dev,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,

To improve recruitment and retention of this population in studies spanning from the prenatal period to middle childhood, it is imperative to determine ways to improve key research engagement factors. The current manuscript uses a qualitative approach to determine important factors related to recruiting, enrolling, and retaining high-risk pregnant and postpartum women. The current sample included 41 high-risk women who participated in focus groups or individual interviews. All interviews were analyzed to identify broad themes related to engaging high-risk pregnant and parenting women in a 10-year longitudinal research project. Themes were organized into key engagement factors related to the following: (1) recruitment strategies, (2) enrollment, and (3) retention of high-risk pregnant and parenting women in longitudinal research studies. Results indicated recruitment strategies related to ideal recruitment locations, material, and who should share research study information with high-risk participants. Related to enrollment, key areas disclosed focused on enrollment decision-making, factors that create interest in joining a research project, and barriers to joining a longitudinal research study. With regard to retention, themes focused on supports needed to stay in research, barriers to staying in research, and best ways to stay in contact with high-risk participants. Overall, the current qualitative data provide preliminary data that enhance the understanding of a continuum of factors that impact engagement of high-risk pregnant and postpartum women in longitudinal research with current results indicating the need to prioritize recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies in order to effectively engage vulnerable populations in research.",Best Practices;Comprehension;Decision Making;Focus Groups;Interview;Manuscript;Needs;Overall;Parenting;Population;Postpartum Women;Preliminary Data;Research;Risk;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Vulnerable Populations;Women,Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Advers Resil Sci,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
33766722,2021,Post-discharge healthcare utilization in infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.,"The opioid epidemic in the United States has led to a significant increase in the incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS); however, the understanding of long-term consequences of NOWS is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate post-discharge healthcare utilization in infants with NOWS and examine the association between NOWS severity and healthcare utilization. A retrospective cohort design was used to ascertain healthcare utilization in the first year after birth-related discharge using the CERNER Health Facts® database. ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnostic codes were used to identify live births and to classify infants into two study groups: NOWS and uncomplicated births (a 25% random sample). Evaluated outcomes included rehospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits within 30-days and one-year after discharge, and a composite one-year utilization event (either hospitalization or emergency department visit during that year). NOWS severity was operationalized as pharmacologic treatment, length of hospitalization, and medical conditions often associated with NOWS. In 3,526 infants with NOWS (restricted to gestational age ≥ 33 weeks), NOWS severity was associated with an increase in composite one-year utilization (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.04-1.2) after adjusting for prematurity, sepsis, jaundice, use of antibiotics, infant sex, insurance status, race, hospital bed size, year of birth, and census division. In a subset of full-term infants (3008 with NOWS and 88,452 uncomplicated births), having a NOWS diagnosis was associated with higher odds of a 30-day (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.03-2.4) and one-year rehospitalization (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.4) after adjusting for infant sex, race, type of medical insurance, hospital location, census division, year of primary encounter, hospital bed size, and medical conditions. This study found higher healthcare utilization during the first year of life in infants diagnosed with NOWS, especially those with severe NOWS. Findings suggest a need for closer post-discharge follow-up and management of infants with NOWS.","Adult;Aftercare;Antibiotics;Association;Censuses;Cohort Studies;Comprehension;Database;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis;Emergency Medical Services;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Gestational Age;Health;Health Care;Hospital Bed Capacity;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-10;ICD-9;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Insurance;Insurance Coverage;International Classification of Diseases;Jaundice;Length of Stay;Life;Live Birth;Male;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Parturition;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient Discharge;Patient Readmission;Pregnancy;Racial Stocks;Retrospective Studies;Sepsis;Sex;Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States",Jaundice;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Sepsis;Syndrome,Neurotoxicol Teratol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34316723,2020,Fifty Years of Research on Prenatal Substances: Lessons Learned for the Opioid Epidemic.,"Current efforts to design research on developmental effects of prenatal opioid exposure can benefit from knowledge gained from 50 years of studies of fetal alcohol and prenatal drug exposures such as cocaine. Scientific advances in neurobiology, developmental psychopathology, infant assessments, genetics, and imaging support the principles of developmental neurotoxicology that guide research in prenatal exposures. Important to research design is accurate assessment of amount, frequency, and timing of exposure which benefits from accurate self-report and biomarkers of exposure. Identifying and control of pre- and postnatal factors that impact development are difficult and dependent on appropriate research design and selection of comparison groups and measurement of confounding, mediating, and moderating variables. Polysubstance exposure has increased due to the number of prescribed and nonprescribed substances used by pregnant women and varying combinations of drugs may have differential effects on the outcome. Multiple experimental and clinical assessments of infant behavior have been developed but predicting outcome before 18-24 months of age remains difficult. With some exceptions, prenatal substance exposure effect sizes have been small, and cognitive and behavioral effects tend to be specific rather than global. Studies require large sample sizes, adequate retention, and support for social services in at-risk samples. The ethical and legal contexts and stigma associated with drug/alcohol use disorder should be considered in order to prevent harm to families in research programs. Recognition of the pervasive use of addictive substances in this nation should lead to broad scientific efforts to understand how substances affect child outcomes and to initiate prevention and intervention where needed.",Affect;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohols;Biomarkers;Child;Cocaine;Family;Genetics;Infant;Infant Behavior;Knowledge;Lead;Mediating;Neurobiology;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnant Women;Program;Psychopathology;Research;Research Design;Risk;Sample Size;Self Report;Social Work,Alcohol Use Disorder,Advers Resil Sci,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34388637,2021,Effects of prenatal opioid exposure on functional networks in infancy.,"Prenatal opioid exposure has been linked to altered neurodevelopment and visual problems such as strabismus and nystagmus. The neural substrate underlying these alterations is unclear. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfMRI) is an advanced and well-established technique to evaluate brain networks. Few studies have examined the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on resting-state network connectivity in infancy. In this pilot study, we characterized network connectivity in opioid-exposed infants (n = 19) and controls (n = 20) between 4-8 weeks of age using both a whole-brain connectomic approach and a seed-based approach. Prenatal opioid exposure was associated with differences in distribution of betweenness centrality and connection length, with positive connections unique to each group significantly longer than common connections. The unique connections in the opioid-exposed group were more often inter-network connections while unique connections in controls and connections common to both groups were more often intra-network. The opioid-exposed group had smaller network volumes particularly in the primary visual network, but similar network strength as controls. Network topologies as determined by dice similarity index were different between groups, particularly in visual and executive control networks. These results may provide insight into the neural basis for the developmental and visual problems associated with prenatal opioid exposure.","Analgesics, Opioid;Brain;Brain Mapping;Connectome;Connectomics;Executive Function;Female;Humans;Index;Infant;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Pathways;Opioids;Pilot Projects;Pregnancy;Seeds;Strabismus;Syndrome;fMRI",Strabismus;Syndrome,Dev Cogn Neurosci,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34588611,2022,Severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome with prenatal exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitors.,"To evaluate the severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) in infants prenatally exposed to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI). A prospective cohort included 148 maternal-infant pairs categorized into MOUD (n = 127) and MOUD + SRI (n = 27) groups. NOWS severity was operationalized as the infant's need for pharmacologic treatment with opioids, duration of hospitalization, and duration of treatment. The association between prenatal SRI exposure and the need for pharmacologic treatment (logistic regression), time-to-discharge, and time-to-treatment discontinuation (Cox proportional hazards modeling) was examined after adjusting for the type of maternal MOUD, use of hydroxyzine, other opioids, benzodiazepines/sedatives, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, gestational age, and breastfeeding. Infants in the MOUD + SRI group were more likely to receive pharmacologic treatment for NOWS (OR = 3.58; 95% CI: 1.31; 9.76) and had a longer hospitalization (median: 11 vs. 6 days; HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33; 0.89) compared to the MOUD group. With respect to time-to-treatment discontinuation, no association was observed in infants who received treatment (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.32); however, significant differences were observed in the entire sample (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.89). Use of SRIs among pregnant women on MOUD might be associated with more severe NOWS. A potential drug-drug interaction between maternal SRIs and opioid medications that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin has been hypothesized but not carefully evaluated in clinical studies. Results of this prospective cohort indicate that the use of SRIs among pregnant women on MOUD is associated with more severe neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. This is the first prospective study which carefully examined effect modification between the type of maternal MOUD and SRI use on neonatal outcomes. This report lays the foundation for treatment optimization in pregnant women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders.","Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Benzodiazepines;Breast Feeding;Cannabis;Clinical Study;Drug Interactions;Duration of Therapy;Female;Foundations;Gestational Age;Hospitalization;Humans;Hydroxyzine;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Infant, Newborn, Diseases;Logistic Regression;Mental Health;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Prospective Studies;Report;Respect;Sedatives;Serotonin;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors;Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;Time-to-Treatment;Tobacco","Infant, Newborn, Diseases;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome",Pediatr Res,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
34601061,2021,Co-occurrence of preconception maternal childhood adversity and opioid use during pregnancy: Implications for offspring brain development.,"Understanding of the effects of in utero opioid exposure on neurodevelopment is a priority given the recent dramatic increase in opioid use among pregnant individuals. However, opioid abuse does not occur in isolation-pregnant individuals abusing opioids often have a significant history of adverse experiences in childhood, among other co-occurring factors. Understanding the specific pathways in which these frequently co-occurring factors may interact and cumulatively influence offspring brain development in utero represents a priority for future research in this area. We highlight maternal history of childhood adversity (CA) as one such co-occurring factor that is more prevalent among individuals using opioids during pregnancy and which is increasingly shown to affect offspring neurodevelopment through mechanisms beginning in utero. Despite the high incidence of CA history in pregnant individuals using opioids, we understand very little about the effects of comorbid prenatal opioid exposure and maternal CA history on fetal brain development. Here, we first provide an overview of current knowledge regarding effects of opioid exposure and maternal CA on offspring neurodevelopment that may occur during gestation. We then outline potential mechanistic pathways through which these factors might have interactive and cumulative influences on offspring neurodevelopment as a foundation for future research in this area.","Adverse Childhood Experiences;Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Biology;Brain;Child;Child Development;Comprehension;Female;Fetal Development;Foundations;Future;History;Humans;Incidence;Knowledge;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Outline;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Research",Opioid Abuse;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Neurotoxicol Teratol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35396369,2022,Prenatal opioid-exposed infant extracellular miRNA signature obtained at birth predicts severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.,"Prenatal opioid exposure (POE) is commonly associated with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), which is characterized by a broad variability in symptoms and severity. Currently there are no diagnostic tools to reliably predict which infants will develop severe NOWS, while risk stratification would allow for proactive decisions about appropriate clinical monitoring and interventions. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess if extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in umbilical cord plasma of infants with POE could predict NOWS severity. Participants (n = 58) consisted of pregnant women receiving medications for opioid use disorder and their infants. NOWS severity was operationalized as the need for pharmacologic treatment and prolonged hospitalization (≥ 14 days). Cord blood miRNAs were assessed using semi-quantitative qRT-PCR arrays. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) were estimated. The expression of three miRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-421) predicted need for pharmacologic treatment (AUC: 0.85) and prolonged hospitalization (AUC: 0.90). Predictive validity improved after two miRNAs (let-7d-5p, miR-584-5p) were added to the need for pharmacologic treatment model (AUC: 0.94) and another two miRNAs (let-7b-5p, miR-10-5p) to the prolonged hospitalization model (AUC: 0.99). Infant cord blood extracellular miRNAs can proactively identify opioid-exposed neonates at high-risk for developing severe NOWS.","Analgesics, Opioid;Area Under Curve;Cohort Studies;Cord Blood;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Linear Energy Transfer;MicroRNAs;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Parturition;Plasma;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Prospective Studies;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Risk;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Umbilical Cord",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome,Sci Rep,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35552232,2022,Evidence for the Normalization Effects of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Connectivity in Neonates with Prenatal Opioid Exposure.,"Altered functional connectivity has been reported in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, which significantly interrupts and influences endogenous neurotransmitter/receptor signaling during fetal programming. Better birth outcomes and long-term developmental outcomes are associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy, but the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We aimed to characterize effects of prenatal opioid/other drug exposure (PODE) and the neural basis for the reported beneficial effects of MOUD by examining neonatal brain functional organization. A cohort of 109 human newborns, 42 PODE, 39 with prenatal exposure to drugs excluding opioids (PDE), 28 drug-free controls (males and females) underwent resting-state fMRI at 2 weeks of age. To examine neural effects of MOUD, PODE infants were separated into subgroups based on whether mothers received MOUD (n = 31) or no treatment (n = 11). A novel heatmap analysis was designed to characterize PODE-associated functional connectivity alterations and MOUD-related effects, and permutation testing identified regions of interest with significant effects. PODE neonates showed alterations beyond those associated with PDE, particularly in reward-related frontal-sensory connectivity. MOUD was associated with a significant reduction of PODE-related alterations in key regions of endogenous opioid pathways including limbic and frontal connections. However, significant residual effects in limbic and subcortical circuitry were observed. These findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with PODE. Importantly, widespread normalization effects associated with MOUD reveal, for the first time, the potential brain basis of the beneficial effects of MOUD on the developing brain and underscore the importance of this treatment intervention for better developmental outcomes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This is the first study to reveal the potential neural mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects on the neonate brain associated with MOUD during pregnancy. We identified both normalization and residual effects of MOUD on brain functional architecture by directly comparing neonates prenatally exposed to opioids with MOUD and those exposed to opioids but without MOUD. Our findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with prenatal opioid exposure and demonstrate that although significant residual effects remain in reward circuitry, MOUD confers significant normalization effects on functional connectivity of regions associated with socioemotional development and reward processing. Together, our results highlight the importance of MOUD intervention for better neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Architecture;Brain;Female;Fetal Programming;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Mothers;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Parturition;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Receptors, Neurotransmitter;Reward;Separated;Therapeutics;Time;fMRI",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,J Neurosci,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35602654,2022,Neural alterations in opioid-exposed infants revealed by edge-centric brain functional networks.,"Prenatal opioid exposure has been linked to adverse effects spanning multiple neurodevelopmental domains, including cognition, motor development, attention, and vision. However, the neural basis of these abnormalities is largely unknown. A total of 49 infants, including 21 opioid-exposed and 28 controls, were enrolled and underwent MRI (43 ± 6 days old) after birth, including resting state functional MRI. Edge-centric functional networks based on dynamic functional connections were constructed, and machine-learning methods were employed to identify neural features distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from unexposed controls. An accuracy of 73.6% (sensitivity 76.25% and specificity 69.33%) was achieved using 10 times 10-fold cross-validation, which substantially outperformed those obtained using conventional static functional connections (accuracy 56.9%). More importantly, we identified that prenatal opioid exposure preferentially affects inter- rather than intra-network dynamic functional connections, particularly with the visual, subcortical, and default mode networks. Consistent results at the brain regional and connection levels were also observed, where the brain regions and connections associated with visual and higher order cognitive functions played pivotal roles in distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from controls. Our findings support the clinical phenotype of infants exposed to opioids in utero and may potentially explain the higher rates of visual and emotional problems observed in this population. Finally, our findings suggested that edge-centric networks could better capture the neural differences between opioid-exposed infants and controls by abstracting the intrinsic co-fluctuation along edges, which may provide a promising tool for future studies focusing on investigating the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopment.","Abstracting;Affect;Attention;Brain;Cognition;Default Mode Network;Future;Infant;Machine Learning;Methods;Opioids;Parturition;Phenotype;Population;Role;Sensitivity;Specificity;Time;Vision, Ocular;fMRI",,Brain Commun,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
35948606,2022,Early developmental trajectory of children with prenatal alcohol and opioid exposure.,"With significant increases in opioid use/misuse and persistent high prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), identifying infants at risk for long-term developmental sequelae due to these exposures remains an urgent need. This study reports on developmental outcomes in young children from a prospective cohort, ENRICH-1, which recruited pregnant women and followed up maternal-infant pairs. Subjects were assigned to four study groups based on prenatal use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), PAE, MOUD+PAE, and unexposed controls (UC). Mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate changes in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III (BSID-III) Cognitive, Language, and Motor scores between 6 and 20 months. There was a significant three-way interaction (MOUD-by-PAE-by-Time) with respect to the BSID-III Cognitive (p = 0.045) and Motor (p = 0.033) scales. Significant changes between the two evaluations were observed for MOUD group in Cognitive and Language scores; for PAE group in Cognitive, Language, and Motor scores, and for MOUD+PAE group in Language scores after adjusting for child sex and family socio-economic status. The developmental scores for the UC remained stable. Observed decline in neurodevelopmental scores during the first 2 years of life emphasizes the importance of a longitudinal approach when evaluating children with prenatal polysubstance exposure. BSID-III scores were stable during the first 2 years of life for unexposed children. BSID-III scores declined for children with prenatal exposures to alcohol and/or opioids. Standard developmental tests may not be sensitive enough during the first year of life.

36169547,2023,"MRI Findings in Third-Trimester Opioid-Exposed Fetuses, With Focus on Brain Measurements: A Prospective Multicenter Case-Control Study.","BACKGROUND. The opioid epidemic has profoundly affected infants born in the United States, as in utero opioid exposure increases the risk of cognitive and behavioral problems in childhood. Scarce literature has evaluated prenatal brain development in fetuses with opioid exposure in utero (hereafter opioid-exposed fetuses). OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to compare opioid-exposed fetuses and fetuses without opioid exposure (hereafter unexposed fetuses) in terms of 2D biometric measurements of the brain and additional pregnancy-related assessments on fetal MRI. METHODS. This prospective case-control study included patients in the third trimester of pregnancy who underwent investigational fetal MRI at one of three U.S. academic medical centers from July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021. Fetuses were classified as opioid exposed or unexposed in utero. Fourteen 2D biometric measurements of the fetal brain were manually assessed and used to derive four indexes. Measurements and indexes were compared between the two groups by use of multivariable linear regression models, which were adjusted for gestational age (GA), fetal sex, and nicotine exposure. Additional pregnancy-related findings on MRI were evaluated. RESULTS. The study included 65 women (mean age, 29.0 ± 5.5 [SD] years). A total of 28 fetuses (mean GA at the time of MRI, 32.2 ± 2.5 weeks) were opioid-exposed, and 37 fetuses (mean GA at the time of MRI, 31.9 ± 2.7 weeks) were unexposed. In the adjusted models, seven measurements were smaller (p &lt; .05) in opioid-exposed fetuses than in unexposed fetuses: cerebral frontooccipital diameter (93.8 ± 7.4 vs 95.0 ± 8.6 mm), bone biparietal diameter (79.0 ± 6.0 vs 80.3 ± 7.1 mm), brain biparietal diameter (72.9 ± 7.7 vs 74.1 ± 8.6 mm), corpus callosum length (37.7 ± 4.0 vs 39.4 ± 3.7 mm), vermis height (18.2 ± 2.7 vs 18.8 ± 2.6 mm), anteroposterior pons measurement (11.6 ± 1.4 vs 12.1 ± 1.4 mm), and transverse cerebellar diameter (40.4 ± 5.1 vs 41.4 ± 6.0 mm). In addition, in the adjusted model, the frontoocccipital index was larger (p = .02) in opioid-exposed fetuses (0.04 ± 0.02) than in unexposed fetuses (0.04 ± 0.02). Remaining measures and indexes were not significantly different between the two groups (p &gt; .05). Fetal motion, cervical length, and deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid were not significantly different (p &gt; .05) between groups. Opioid-exposed fetuses, compared with unexposed fetuses, showed higher frequencies of both breech position (21% vs 3%, p = .03) and increased amniotic fluid volume (29% vs 8%, p = .04). CONCLUSION. Fetuses with opioid exposure in utero had a smaller brain size and altered fetal physiology. CLINICAL IMPACT. The findings provide insight into the impact of prenatal opioid exposure on fetal brain development.","Academic Medical Centers;Amniotic Fluid;Bones;Brain;Case-Control Studies;Corpus Callosum;Fetus;Gestational Age;Index;Infant;Linear Regression;Literature;Measures;Motion;Nicotine;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Patients;Physiology;Pons;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Problem Behavior;Risk;Sex;Time;United States;Women",,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Like,
32367543,2020,When ESKD complicates the management of pain.,"Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported by patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and negatively impacts their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), dialysis adherence, healthcare utilization, and mortality. There are a number of patient-related and health system-related barriers that make it very challenging to treat pain in these patients. Moreover, the limited availability of efficacious and safe nonopiate analgesic options has led to over-use of opioids in this population. We propose a framework for pain assessment and tailored treatment using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to optimize pain management and opioid use. Additionally, we recommend system-level changes to improve care coordination and pain management in ESKD patients.","Analgesics;Dialysis;Health;Health Care;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Mortality;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Patient Compliance;Patients;Population;Quality of Life;Renal Dialysis;Therapeutics","Kidney Failure, Chronic;Pain",Semin Dial,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32941189,2020,Pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease.,"This review evaluates current recommendations for pain management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a specific focus on evidence for opioid analgesia, including the partial agonist, buprenorphine. Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor. Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.","Acetaminophen;Adjustment;Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal;Buprenorphine;Chronic Kidney Diseases;Exercise;Fentanyl;Humans;Hydromorphone;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Methadone;Norepinephrine;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Population;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Review;Risk;Serotonin;Therapeutics","Chronic Kidney Diseases;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Pain;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

In the general population with chronic noncancer pain, there is some evidence that opioid reduction or discontinuation is associated with improved pain outcomes; however, tapering opioids abruptly or without providing supportive interventions can lead to physical and psychological harms and relapse of opioid use. There is emerging evidence that nonpharmacologic treatments such as psychosocial interventions, acupuncture, and interdisciplinary pain management programs are effective approaches to support opioid dose reduction in patients experiencing persistent pain, but research in this area still is relatively new. This review describes the current evidence for nonpharmacologic interventions to support opioid reduction in non-CKD patients with pain and discusses the application of the available evidence to patients with advanced CKD who are prescribed opioids to manage pain.","Acupuncture;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Disease;Chronic Kidney Diseases;Chronic Pain;Dialysis;Drug Tapering;Health;Humans;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Lead;News;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Population;Program;Psychosocial Intervention;Relapse;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Research;Review;Risk;Therapeutics","Chronic Disease;Chronic Kidney Diseases;Chronic Pain;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Pain;Relapse;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",Semin Nephrol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34621058,2022,Opioids for chronic pain management in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure.,"Chronic pain is highly prevalent among adults treated with maintenance haemodialysis (HD) and has profound negative effects. Over four decades, research has demonstrated that 50-80% of adult patients treated with HD report having pain. Half of patients with HD-dependent kidney failure (HDKF) have chronic moderate-to-severe pain, which is similar to the burden of pain in patients with cancer. However, pain management in patients with HDKF is often ineffective as most patients report that their pain is inadequately treated. Opioid analgesics are prescribed more frequently for patients receiving HD than for individuals in the general population with chronic pain, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. Furthermore, current opioid prescribing patterns are frequently inconsistent with guideline-recommended care. Evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in pain management in general, and in patients with HDKF specifically, is lacking. Nonetheless, long-term opioid therapy has a role in the treatment of some patients when used selectively, carefully and combined with an ongoing assessment of risks and benefits. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the use of opioid therapy in patients with HDKF and chronic pain, including a discussion of buprenorphine, which has potential as an analgesic option for patients receiving HD owing to its unique pharmacological properties.","Adult;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cancer;Chronic Pain;Dialysis;Guideline;Health Care;Humans;Kidney Failure;Maintenance;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Renal Dialysis;Renal Insufficiency;Report;Research;Resources;Risks and Benefits;Role;Therapeutics",Cancer;Chronic Pain;Kidney Failure;Pain;Renal Insufficiency,Nat Rev Nephrol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34750335,2022,Novel approach to unpleasant symptom clusters surrounding pruritus in patients with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis therapy.,"Chronic kidney disease-associated-pruritus (CKD-aP) is a common symptom in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing dialysis. CKD-aP typically occurs alongside other debilitating symptoms and may comprise so-called 'symptom clusters' which have synergistic effects that adversely impact patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Importantly, symptoms in a cluster may share a common biological mechanism. Here we review the clinical impact of CKD-aP and its association with other symptoms reported by dialysis patients. The clinical benefits of treating pruritus and its potential impact on other symptoms are also addressed. Studies have shown CKD-aP significantly impairs HRQoL in patients with ESKD undergoing dialysis and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including increased risk of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality. Despite these negative effects, CKD-aP remains underrecognized and undertreated in clinical practice. CKD-aP is frequently associated with other symptoms, including disturbed sleep/poor sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and pain. Clinical studies of antipruritic therapies show that reduction of itch intensity may also alleviate other associated symptoms, such as poor sleep quality. CKD-aP and its associated symptoms are inadequately managed in clinical practice. Greater understanding and awareness of CKD-aP and its surrounding symptom clusters in dialysis patients may improve their overall symptom management and HRQoL.","Antipruritics;Anxiety;Association;Awareness;Biopharmaceuticals;Chronic Kidney Diseases;Clinical Study;Comprehension;Depression;Dialysis;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Hospitalization;Humans;Infections;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Mortality;Overall;Pain;Patients;Pruritus;Quality of Life;Renal Dialysis;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Review;Risk;Sleep;Syndrome;Therapeutics","Chronic Kidney Diseases;Infections;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Pain;Pruritus;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Syndrome",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34973699,2021,"Emerging Patient-Centered Concepts in Pain Among Adults With Chronic Kidney Disease, Maintenance Dialysis, and Kidney Transplant.","Patient reports of moderate to severe pain are common across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease. The synergistic effects of comorbid depression and anxiety can lead to maladaptive coping responses to pain, namely pain catastrophizing and illness-related post-traumatic stress disorder. If underlying depression and anxiety and associated maladaptive coping responses are not treated, patients can experience an increased perception of pain, worsened disability, decreased quality of life, withdrawal from social activities, and increased morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, interest in nonpharmacologic treatments for pain that targets coping as well as comorbid anxiety and depression has been increasing, particularly given the significant societal damage that has resulted from the opioid epidemic. Evidence-based, nonpharmacologic treatments have shown promise in treating pain in areas outside of nephrology. Currently, little is known about the effects of these treatments among adults with CKD, and particularly end-stage kidney disease, when chronic pain can become debilitating. In this review, we examine patient-centered concepts related to pain that have received little attention in the nephrology literature. We also describe emerging areas of research, including omics technologies for biomarker discovery and advanced symptom clustering methods for symptom phenotyping, which may be useful to future kidney disease research and treatment.","Adult;Anxiety;Attention;Biomarkers;Chronic Kidney Diseases;Chronic Pain;Cluster Analysis;Depression;Dialysis;Female;Future;Humans;Kidney;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Kidney Transplantation;Lead;Literature;Maintenance;Male;Methods;Morbidity;Mortality;Nephrology;Opioid Epidemic;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Patient-Centered Care;Patients;Perception;Quality of Life;Renal Dialysis;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Report;Research;Review;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Technology;Therapeutics;Transplants","Chronic Kidney Diseases;Chronic Pain;Kidney Diseases;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Pain;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Semin Nephrol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34464585,2021,Incidence and predictors of persistent pelvic pain following hysterectomy in women with chronic pelvic pain.,"Chronic pelvic pain is a debilitating problem that afflicts 15% to 20% of women in the United States. Although more than 200,000 hysterectomies are performed annually for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, previous studies indicate that 1 in 4 women undergo the discomfort and morbidity of hysterectomy without the relief of pain. The factors that predict treatment failure remain poorly characterized. To describe the incidence of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy in women with chronic pelvic pain and determine whether a simple, self-reported measure of central sensitization is associated with a greater risk of persistent pelvic pain following hysterectomy. We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy at an academic tertiary care center for a benign indication. Patients with preoperative chronic pelvic pain, defined as average pelvic pain ≥3 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale for &gt;3 months before hysterectomy, were included in this analysis. The patients completed validated assessments of pain, anxiety, depression, and centralized pain (using the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria, 0-31 points) preoperatively and 6 months after hysterectomy. The demographic information, surgical history, intraoperative findings, and surgical pathology were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy, defined as &lt;50% improvement in pelvic pain severity. Among 176 participants with pelvic pain before hysterectomy, 126 (71.6%) were retained at 6 months, and 15 (11.9%) reported persistent pelvic pain. There was no difference in age (P=.46), race (P=.55), average pain severity during menses (P=.68), average overall pelvic pain (P=.10), or pain duration (P=.80) in those with and without persistent pelvic pain. Whereas intraoperative findings of endometriosis (P=.05) and uterine fibroids (P=.03) were associated with a higher incidence of persistent pain on univariate analysis, the surgical route (P=.46), pelvic adhesions (0.51), uterine weight (P=.66), and adenomyosis on histopathology (P=.27) were not related to the risk of persistent pain. Higher preoperative centralized pain scores (P=.01) but not depression (P=.64) or anxiety (P=.45) were more common in women with persistent pelvic pain. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, preoperative pain severity, anxiety, depression, and operative findings of endometriosis and fibroids indicated that every 1-point increase in centralized pain before hysterectomy was associated with a 27% increase in the odds of persistent pelvic pain (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.57) 6 months after surgery. Although the majority of women with chronic pelvic pain report considerable improvement in pain following hysterectomy, higher degrees of centralized pain before hysterectomy is a robust predictor of persistent pelvic pain.","Adenomyosis;Adult;Anxiety;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Depression;Electronic Health Records;Endometriosis;Female;Fibroid Uterus;Fibromyalgia;General Surgery;History;Humans;Hysterectomy;Incidence;Leiomyoma;Logistic Regression;Measures;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Odds Ratio;Overall;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain, Intractable;Pathology, Surgical;Patients;Pelvic Pain;Postoperative Period;Racial Stocks;Report;Risk;Scales;Self;Surveys;Tertiary Care Centers;Therapeutics;Treatment Failure;United States;Weights;Women","Adenomyosis;Chronic Pain;Endometriosis;Fibroid Uterus;Fibromyalgia;Leiomyoma;Pain;Pain, Intractable;Pelvic Pain",Am J Obstet Gynecol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35129496,2021,Association Between State Limits on Opioid Prescribing and the Incidence of Persistent Postoperative Opioid Use Among Surgical Patients.,"To examine whether laws limiting opioid prescribing have been associated with reductions in the incidence of persistent postoperative opioid use. In an effort to address the opioid epidemic, 26 states (as of 2018) have passed laws limiting opioid prescribing for acute pain. However, it is unknown whether these laws have achieved their reduced the risk of persistent postoperative opioid use. We identified 957,639 privately insured patients undergoing one of 10 procedures between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2018. We then estimated the association between persistent postoperative opioid use, defined as having filled ≥10 prescriptions or ≥120 days supply of opioids during postoperative days 91-365, and whether opioid prescribing limits were in effect on the day of surgery. States were classified as having: no limits, a limit of ≤7 days supply, or a limit of &gt;7 days supply. The regression models adjusted for observable confounders such as patient comorbidities and also utilized a difference-in-differences approach, which relied on variation in state laws over time, to further minimize confounding. The adjusted incidence of persistent postoperative opioid use was 3.5% (95%CI 3.3%-3.7%) for patients facing a limit of ≤7 days supply, compared with 3.3% (95%CI 3.3%-3.3%) for patients facing no prescribing limits (p=0.13 for difference compared to no prescribing limits) and 3.4%, (95%CI 3.2%-3.6%) for patients facing a limit of &gt;7 days supply (p=0.43 for difference compared to no prescribing limits).

Advances in the clinical management of chronic pain have been limited due to incomplete understanding of the multiple risk factors and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of chronic pain. The Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program aims to characterize the predictive nature of biomarkers (brain imaging, high-throughput molecular screening techniques, or ""omics,"" quantitative sensory testing, patient-reported outcome assessments and functional assessments) to identify individuals who will develop chronic pain following surgical intervention. The A2CPS is a multisite observational study investigating biomarkers and collective biosignatures (a combination of several individual biomarkers) that predict susceptibility or resilience to the development of chronic pain following knee arthroplasty and thoracic surgery. This manuscript provides an overview of data collection methods and procedures designed to standardize data collection across multiple clinical sites and institutions. Pain-related biomarkers are evaluated before surgery and up to 3 months after surgery for use as predictors of patient reported outcomes 6 months after surgery. The dataset from this prospective observational study will be available for researchers internal and external to the A2CPS Consortium to advance understanding of the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Biomarkers;Brain Imaging;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Data Collection;Data Collection Methods;Dataset;General Surgery;Global Health;Manuscript;Nature;Observational Study;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Reported Outcomes;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Procedures;Program;Quality of Life;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Screening;Thoracic Surgery","Chronic Pain;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic",Front Med (Lausanne),Cross-Cutting Projects,Like,

29713840,2018,Using Goal Achievement Training in juvenile justice settings to improve substance use services for youth on community supervision.,"The link between substance use and involvement in the juvenile justice system has been well established. Justice-involved youth tend to have higher rates of drug use than their non-offending peers. At the same time, continued use can contribute to an elevated risk of recidivism, which leads to further, and oftentimes more serious, involvement with the juvenile justice system. Because of these high rates of use, the juvenile justice system is well positioned to help identify youth with substance use problems and connect them to treatment. However, research has found that only about 60% of juvenile probation agencies screen all youth for substance involvement, and even fewer provide comprehensive assessment or help youth enroll in substance use treatment. This paper describes an integrated training curriculum that was developed to help juvenile justice agencies improve their continuum of care for youth probationers with substance use problems. Goal Achievement Training (GAT) provides a platform for continuous quality improvement via two sessions delivered onsite to small groups of staff from juvenile justice and behavioral health agencies. In the first session, participants are taught to identify goals and goal steps for addressing identified areas of unmet need (i.e., screening, assessment, and linkage to treatment services). In the second session, participants learn principles and strategies of data-driven decision-making for achieving these goals. This paper highlights GAT as a model for the effective implementation of cost-efficient training strategies designed to increase self-directed quality improvement activities that can be applied to any performance domain within juvenile justice settings. Efforts to monitor implementation fidelity of GAT within the specific context of the juvenile justice settings are highlighted. Challenges to setting the stage for process improvement generally, as well as specific hurdles within juvenile justice settings are discussed, as are next steps in disseminating findings regarding the fidelity to and effectiveness of GAT in this unique context.

30352669,2018,Facility-level changes in receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder: Implications for implementation science.,"The U.S. is facing an opioid epidemic, but despite mandates for pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder to be available at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, the majority of veterans with opioid use disorder do not receive these medications. In implementation research, facilities are often targeted for qualitative inquiry or quality improvement efforts based on quality measure performance during a one-year period. However, sites that experience quality performance changes from one year to the next may be highly informative because mechanisms that impact facility change may be more discoverable. The current study examined changes in receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder in a national healthcare system to determine the extent to which sites fluctuated in performance over a two-year period and illustrate how changes in quality measures over time may be useful for implementation research and healthcare surveillance of quality measures. Using national VHA data from Fiscal Years (FY) 2016 and 2017, we calculated quality measure performance as the number of patients who received pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) divided by the number of patients with a current non-remitted opioid use disorder diagnosis for each FY at each facility (n = 129) and examined change from FY16 to FY17. The mean rate of receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder was 38% (facility range = 3% to 74%) in FY16 and 41% (facility range = 2% to 76%) in FY17. The average facility-level change in performance was 3% and ranged from -19% to 26%. There were 32 facilities that decreased in provision of pharmacotherapy, 12 facilities with no change, and 85 facilities that increased. For facilities with average or high performance, it was difficult to maintain their performance over time. Identifying and learning from facilities with recent fluctuations may be more informative to guide the design of future quality improvement efforts than studying facilities with stable high or low performance.","Administration;Buprenorphine;Diagnosis;Drug Therapy;Future;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Hospitals, Veterans;Humans;Implementation Science;Learning;Measures;Methadone;Naltrexone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Quality Improvement;Quality Indicators, Health Care;Research;Time;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

30797042,2019,A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine for probationers and parolees: Bridging the gap into treatment.,"Buprenorphine can be effective in a variety of community substance use treatment settings outside of methadone programs, including outpatient programs and medical practices. In these settings, it has been found to be effective in reducing opioid use and retaining patients in treatment. Despite its effectiveness and safety, it is rarely provided to individuals with opioid use disorders in probation and parole settings. Male and female individuals under probation or parole supervision (N = 320) with histories of opioid use disorder will be enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms: Buprenorphine Bridge Treatment (BBT): Participants will begin buprenorphine using the MedicaSafe dispensing device immediately after an on-site intake at a community supervision office and continue such treatment until they are transitioned to a community program; or Treatment as Usual (TAU): Participants will receive a referral to buprenorphine pharmacotherapy treatment in the community. Treatment outcomes will be: (a) illicit opioid oral saliva drug test results; and (b) treatment adherence (i. entered community based treatment; ii. number of days receiving opioid treatment). We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design. If shown to increase compliance rates with conditions of probation and parole, buprenorphine treatment co-located at community supervision field offices could have a major impact on delivery of buprenorphine treatment to the criminal justice population.

30916463,2019,Criminal justice outcomes over 5 years after randomization to buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone treatment for opioid use disorder.,"To compare long-term criminal justice outcomes among opioid-dependent individuals randomized to receive buprenorphine or methadone. A 5-year follow-up was conducted in 2011-14 of 303 opioid-dependent participants entering three opioid treatment programs in California, USA in 2006-09 and randomized to receive either buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone. Participants received buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP; n = 179) or methadone (MET; n = 124) for 24 weeks and then were tapered off their treatment over ≤ 8 weeks or referred for ongoing clinical treatment. Midway through the study, the randomization scheme was switched from 1 : 1 BUP : MET to 2 : 1 because of higher dropout in the BUP arm. Study outcomes included arrests and self-reported incarceration. Predictors included randomization condition (buprenorphine versus methadone), age, gender, race/ethnicity, use of cocaine, drug injection in the 30 days prior to baseline and study site. Treatment status (buprenorphine, methadone, none) during follow-up was included as a time-varying covariate. There was no significant difference by randomization condition in the proportion arrested (buprenorphine: 55.3%, methadone: 54.0%) or incarcerated (40.9%, 47.3%) during follow-up. Among methadone-randomized individuals, arrest was less likely with methadone treatment (0.50, 0.35-0.72) during follow-up (relative to no treatment) and switching to buprenorphine had a lower likelihood of arrest than those receiving no treatment (0.39, 0.18-0.87). Among buprenorphine-randomized individuals, arrest was less likely with receipt of buprenorphine (0.49, 0.33-0.75) during follow-up and switching to methadone had a similar likelihood of arrest as methadone-randomized individuals receiving no treatment. Likelihood of arrest was also negatively associated with older age (0.98, 0.96-1.00); it was positively associated with Hispanic ethnicity (1.63, 1.04-2.56), cocaine use (2.00, 1.33-3.03), injection drug use (2.19, 1.26-3.83), and study site. In a US sample of people treated for opioid use disorder, continued treatment with either buprenorphine or methadone was associated with a reduction in arrests relative to no treatment. Cocaine use, injection drug use, Hispanic ethnicity and younger age were associated with higher likelihood of arrest.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Arm;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;California;Cocaine;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Drug Therapy;Ethnic Groups;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Gender;Hispanics;Humans;Injections;Male;Methadone;Middle Aged;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Patient Outcome Assessment;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Racial Stocks;Random Allocation;Relatives;Self;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31158400,2019,"The opioid epidemic in rural northern New England: An approach to epidemiologic, policy, and legal surveillance.","The opioid crisis presents substantial challenges to public health in New England's rural states, where access to pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (OUD), harm reduction, HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) services vary widely. We present an approach to characterizing the epidemiology, policy and resource environment for OUD and its consequences, with a focus on eleven rural counties in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont between 2014 and 2018. We developed health policy summaries and logic models to facilitate comparison of opioid epidemic-related polices across the three states that could influence the risk environment and access to services. We assessed sociodemographic factors, rates of overdose and infectious complications tied to OUD, and drive-time access to prevention and treatment resources. We developed GIS maps and conducted spatial analyses to assess the opioid crisis landscape. Through collaborative research, we assessed the potential impact of available resources to address the opioid crisis in rural New England. Vermont's comprehensive set of policies and practices for drug treatment and harm reduction appeared to be associated with the lowest fatal overdose rates. Franklin County, Massachusetts had good access to naloxone, drug treatment and SSPs, but relatively high overdose and HIV rates. New Hampshire had high proportions of uninsured community members, the highest overdose rates, no HCV surveillance data, and no local access to SSPs. This combination of factors appeared to place PWID in rural New Hampshire at elevated risk.

31201642,2019,Juvenile justice systems of care: results of a national survey of community supervision agencies and behavioral health providers on services provision and cross-system interactions.,"Youth involved in the juvenile justice (JJ) system have high needs for behavioral health services, especially related to substance use and mental disorders. This study aimed to understand the extent to which elements in the cascade model of behavioral health services for JJ-involved youth are provided to youth by Community Supervision (CS) and/or Behavioral Health (BH) providers. In order to understand interactions across CS and BH systems, this study used a multistage probabilistic survey design to sample CS agencies and their primary BH service providers of substance use and mental health treatment in the United States. Parallel surveys were administered to both CS and BH providers regarding: characteristics of youth served, BH services available, whether services were provided directly and/or by referral, use of evidence-based practices (EBPs), and methods of collaboration, referral, and information exchange across CS and BH providers. The findings from weighted national estimates demonstrate that youth referred from CS to the BH programs represent a more severe sub-group of youth under CS supervision. There are established cross-system relationships for assessment and referral for substance use and mental health treatment, but less so for prevention services. Most CS programs refer youth to BH providers for these services, which typically utilize more highly trained staff to provide EBPs to a majority of the youth served. More intensive substance use and mental health treatment, aftercare, and recovery support services were limited in availability. The findings suggest that although many elements in a cascade model of BH services for JJ-involved youth have been implemented within local systems of care through collaboration between CS and BH providers, there are several underdeveloped areas and potential for attrition across the service cascade. Greater attention to providing services to youth with higher levels of severity, aftercare services, and recovery support is warranted within a multi-systemic framework.",Adolescent;Aftercare;Attention;Community;Elements;Evidence-Based Practice;Health;Health Services;Justice;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Methods;Needs;Program;Referral;Substance Use;Supervision;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States;Youth,Mental Disorders;Substance Use,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Community Supervision (CS) agencies are uniquely positioned to impact public health through substance use identification and early intervention. Geographic location (i.e., living in an urban versus rural area) is an understudied factor that can be associated with differences in service and resource availability. A secondary analysis of a nationally representative sample of CS agencies assessed agency and youth characteristics, as well as substance use screening in urban and rural CS agencies. Respondents representing rural agencies reported higher rates of substance use, yet were less likely to report using screeners focused on substance use. Respondents representing urban CS agencies reported a wider variety of screening instruments and were more likely to test for drug use during screening. Differences in the screening process can reflect adaptive and culturally responsive approaches to addressing substance use as well as unique barriers to service provision.

The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is the first statewide correctional system in the United States to offer comprehensive MOUD services to incarcerated individuals.However, due to stigma, eligible individuals may be reluctant to engage with MOUD. This study aims to 1) evaluate the efficacy of an educational video intervention about MOUD and 2) characterize MOUD-related attitudes in a general incarcerated population. Participants were recruited from eight elective classes offered to soon-to-be-released incarcerated individuals at RIDOC. Participants viewed an eight-minute video featuring incarcerated individuals speaking about their experiences using MOUD, designed to reduce MOUD-related stigma. Participants were administered surveys prior to and after watching the video to assess changes in MOUD knowledge (MOUD-K) and MOUD attitudes (MOUD-A). This evaluation of the intervention included 80 incarcerated participants (median age = 35, 93% male, 36% non-Hispanic White, and 26% non-Hispanic Black). Forty percent indicated non-medical opioid use within six months prior to incarceration; 13% had previously used MOUD. Significant improvements in MOUD-K scores (t(65) = -7.0, p &lt; 0.0001) and MOUD-A scores (t(69) = -5.8, p &lt; 0.0001) were detected after participants viewed the video. The intervention yielded greater ΔMOUD-A scores among those identifying as non-Hispanic Black, compared to non-Hispanic Whites (β = 2.6, CI = 0.4, 4.8). The educational video improved both knowledge and positive attitudes towards MOUD, with changes in MOUD attitudes being influenced by race. These findings may inform future MOUD educational programs, thereby helping to reduce opioid use disorder-related morbidity and mortality.","Address;Adult;African Americans;Attitude;Blacks;Community;Criminal Justice;Death;Female;Future;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Health Promotion;Hispanics;Humans;Knowledge;Maintenance;Male;Methadone;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Patient Education as Topic;Population;Positive Attitude;Prisoners;Prisons;Program;Racial Stocks;Rhode Island;Social Stigma;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States;Video Recording;Whites",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The present study assessed HIV risk perceptions as well as PrEP awareness and interest among 39 people who were incarcerated and enrolled in a structured Medication for Addiction Treatment (MAT) program at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections using semi-structured, qualitative interviews. Analysis was conducted using a generalized, inductive method in NVivo 12. While PrEP awareness was low across the study sample, some participants were interested in PrEP uptake or learning more about PrEP after they were provided with an overview of it. PrEP interest strongly related to current perceived HIV risk. Potential barriers included side effects, adherence, and reluctance to take medications in general.

To inform more effective implementation strategies, this analysis identifies and prioritizes promising courses of agency enhancement toward addressing unmet substance use needs.","Address;Adolescent;Criminal Law;Health;Humans;Justice;Juvenile Delinquency;Needs;Offenders;Paper;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Quality Improvement;Quality Indicators, Health Care;Research;Scales;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;United States;Youth",Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Adm Policy Ment Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
31959322,2020,Opioid Prescribing Patterns Before Fatal Opioid Overdose.,"Although opioid prescribing has decreased since 2010, overdose deaths involving illicit opioids have continued to rise. This study explores prescribing patterns before fatal overdose of decedents who died of prescription and illicit opioid overdoses. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2019 and included all 1,893 Illinois residents who died of an opioid-related overdose in 2016. Each decedent was linked to any existing Prescription Monitoring Program records, calculating weekly morphine milligram equivalents for 52 weeks before overdose. Among the 1,893 fatal opioid overdoses, 309 involved any prescription opioid and 1,461 involved illicit opioids without the involvement of prescription opioids. The death rate because of illicit opioids was 23/100,000 among black residents versus 10.5/100,000 among whites. During the last year of life, 76% of prescription opioid decedents filled any opioid prescription totaling 10.7 prescriptions per decedent, compared with 36% of illicit opioid decedents totaling 2.6 prescriptions per decedent. During the last week of life, 33% of prescription opioid decedents filled an opioid prescription totaling 0.42 prescriptions per decedent, compared with 4% of illicit opioid decedents totaling 0.05 prescriptions per decedent. Prescribing patterns alone may not be sufficient to identify patients who are at high risk for opioid overdose, especially for those using illicit opioids. Interventions aimed at reducing opioid overdoses should take into account different patterns of opioid prescribing associated with illicit and prescription opioid overdose deaths and be designed around the local characteristics of the opioid overdose epidemic.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Cohort Studies;Death;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Female;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Illinois;Life;Male;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Program;Records;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Whites",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Am J Prev Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32050112,2020,Estimating the impact of wide scale uptake of screening and medications for opioid use disorder in US prisons and jails.,"Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) are the most effective treatment for OUD, but uptake of these life-saving medications has been extremely limited in US prisons and jail settings, and limited data are available to guide policy decisions. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of screening and treatment with medications for OUD in US prisons and jails on post-release opioid-related mortality. We used data from the National Center for Vital Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and relevant literature to construct Monte Carlo simulations of a counterfactual scenario in which wide scale uptake of screening and treatment with medications for OUD occurred in US prisons and jails in 2016. Our model predicted that 1840 (95% Simulation Interval [SI]: -2757 - 4959) lives would have been saved nationally if all persons who were clinically indicated had received medications for OUD while incarcerated. The model also predicted that approximately 4400 (95% SI: 2675 - 5557) lives would have been saved nationally if all persons who were clinically indicated had received medications for OUD while incarcerated and were retained in treatment post-release. These estimates correspond to 668 (95% SI: -1008 - 1812) and 1609 (95% SI: 972 - 2037) lives saved per 10,000 persons incarcerated, respectively. Prison and jail-based programs that comprehensively screen and provide treatment with medications for OUD have the potential to produce substantial reductions in opioid-related overdose deaths in a high-risk population; however, retention on treatment post-release is a key driver of population level impact.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Correctional Facilities;Death;Female;Humans;Jails;Justice;Life;Life Tables;Literature;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;Monte Carlo Method;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Policy;Population;Prisons;Procedures and Techniques Utilization;Program;Risk;Risk Factors;Savings;Scales;Screening;Statistics;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States;Vital Statistics;Young Adult",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32405971,2020,Substance use prevention services in juvenile justice and behavioral health: results from a national survey.,"This study examined the national availability of substance use prevention (SUP) within juvenile justice (JJ) and their primary behavioral health (BH) providers, and the relationships between the availability of SUP and agency-level measures of organizational structure, staffing, and youth characteristics. A three-stage national probability sampling process was used to select participants for a national survey that included, among other facets of community supervision (CS) and BH practices, questions on agency characteristics, youth characteristics, whether the agency/provider directly provided SUP services, and whether the agency/provider directly provided substance use and/or mental health treatment. This paper focuses on SUP services along with agency/provider and youth characteristics related to providing SUP. The response rate for both CS agencies (n = 195) and BH providers (n = 271) was 96%. Complex samples logistic regression initially examined univariate associations of each variable and identified candidates for a final multivariate model. Overall, only one-third of CS and BH providers reported offering SUP services, with BH providers being significantly more likely than CS agencies to provide SUP services. In addition, likelihood of SUP was significantly lower among agencies where the substance use distribution of the caseload was below the median. Controlling for master's level staff and the substance use distribution, CS agencies were about 67% less likely to offer SUP when compared to BH providers. Given the high rates of substance use among justice-involved youth and that substance use is an established risk for several negative behaviors, outcomes, and health conditions, these findings suggest that evidence-based prevention services should likely be expanded in justice settings, and perhaps included as part of CS programs, even when youth do not initially present with SU service needs.",Association;Behavior;Community;Health;Justice;Logistic Regression;Measures;Mental Health;Needs;Overall;Paper;Probability;Program;Risk;Substance Use;Supervision;Surveys;Therapeutics;Workforce;Youth,Substance Use,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32446130,2020,A Scoping Review of Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of Medications for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder within the Criminal Justice System.,"Policies aimed at addressing the high rates of opioid overdose have prioritized increasing access to medications for treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD). Numerous barriers exist to providing MOUD within the criminal justice system and/or to justice-involved populations. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature on implementation of MOUD within criminal justice settings and with justice-involved populations. A systematic search process identified 53 papers that addressed issues pertaining to implementation barriers or facilitators of MOUD within correctional settings or with justice-involved populations; these were coded and qualitatively analyzed for common themes. Over half of the papers were published outside of the U.S. (n = 28); the most common study designs were surveys or structured interviews (n = 20) and qualitative interviews/focus groups (n = 18) conducted with correctional or treatment staff and with incarcerated individuals. Four categories of barriers and facilitators were identified: institutional, programmatic, attitudinal, and systemic. Institutional barriers typically limited capacity to provide MOUD to justice-involved individuals, which led to programmatic practices in which MOUD was not implemented following clinical guidelines, often resulting in forcible withdrawal or inadequate treatment. These programmatic practices commonly led to aversive experiences among justice-involved individuals, who consequently espoused negative attitudes about MOUD and were reluctant to seek treatment with MOUD following their release to the community. Facilitators of MOUD implementation included increased knowledge and information from training interventions and favorable prior experiences with individuals being treated with MOUD among correctional and treatment staff. Few systemic facilitators to implementing MOUD with justice-involved individuals were evident in the literature. Barriers to implementing MOUD in criminal justice settings and/or with justice-involved populations are pervasive, multi-leveled, and inter-dependent. More work is needed on facilitators of MOUD implementation.",Access To Medicines;Attitude;Classification;Clinical Practice Guideline;Community;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Drug Overdose;Focus Groups;Humans;Interview;Justice;Knowledge;Literature;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paper;Policy;Population;Review;Surveys;Therapeutics;Work,Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32583337,2020,Barriers to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Among Veterans Involved in the Legal System: a Qualitative Study.,"Veterans involved in the legal system are at high risk for overdose but have lower receipt of medications for opioid use disorder than other veterans. The study aimed to understand barriers to medication access from the perspective of legally involved veterans with opioid use disorder and people who work with these veterans in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the legal system. This national qualitative study interviewed veterans and stakeholders from 14 geographically diverse VHA facilities to explore perceptions of barriers to medications for opioid use disorder. Participants included veterans with a history of opioid use disorder and legal involvement (n = 18), VHA Veterans Justice Programs Specialists (n = 15), VHA and community substance use disorder treatment providers (n = 5), and criminal justice staff (n = 12). We conducted interviews based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a team-based approach. Four key barriers, noted by group, were identified: (1) a preference for counseling along with or instead of medications (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); (2) concerns about veterans using medications without a prescription, selling them, or providing them to others (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); (3) concerns about perceived stigma towards medication use (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); and (4) concerns about medication discontinuation after recurrent opioid use (veterans, criminal justice staff). A fifth theme, education, was noted by all stakeholders except providers as important to facilitating use of medications for opioid use disorder. All five themes mapped to the framework construct of knowledge and beliefs about the intervention. Based on identified barriers, interventions focused on enhancing medication knowledge, reducing stigma towards use of medications, and increasing knowledge that opioid use may recur during treatment may help increase access to medication for veterans with legal involvement.",Access To Medicines;Administration;Beliefs;Community;Counseling;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Drug Therapy;Education;Health Services Accessibility;History;Humans;Interview;Justice;Knowledge;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Perception;Persons;Prescriptions;Program;Qualitative Research;Research;Risk;Specialists;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Veterans;Veterans Health;Work,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32712165,2021,Optimizing the impact of medications for opioid use disorder at release from prison and jail settings: A microsimulation modeling study.,"We examined the impact of expanded access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in a unified prison and jail system on post-release, opioid-related overdose mortality. We developed a microsimulation model to simulate a population of 55,000 persons at risk of opioid-related overdose mortality in Rhode Island. The effect of an extended-release (XR) naltrexone only intervention and the effect of providing access to all three MOUD (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and XR-naltrexone) at release from incarceration on cumulative overdose death over eight years (2017-2024) were compared to the standard of care (i.e., limited access to MOUD). In the standard of care scenario, the model predicted 2385 opioid-related overdose deaths between 2017 and 2024. An XR-naltrexone intervention averted 103 deaths (4.3% reduction), and access to all three MOUD averted 139 deaths (5.8% reduction). Among those with prior year incarceration, an XR-naltrexone only intervention and access to all three MOUD reduced overdose deaths by 22.8% and 31.6%, respectively. Expanded access to MOUD in prison and jail settings can reduce overdose mortality in a general, at-risk population. However, the real-world impact of this approach will vary by levels of incarceration, treatment enrollment, and post-release retention.",Access To Medicines;Buprenorphine;Death;Humans;Jails;Methadone;Mortality;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Population;Prisons;Rhode Island;Risk;Standard of Care;Therapeutics,Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32826617,2021,Disparities in Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in the Veterans Health Administration.,"A variety of patients - including women, older, racial/ethnic minority, rural, homeless, and justice-involved patients - are vulnerable to experiencing poor healthcare access and quality, such as lower quality substance use disorder treatment, than other populations. The current study examined receipt of medications for opioid use disorder by vulnerable populations within Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities to determine whether there are patient and facility factors that are associated with disparities in care. Using national VHA clinical/administrative data from Fiscal Year 2017, we calculated receipt of medications for opioid use disorder using the American Society for Addiction Medicine quality measure specifications. A mixed-effects logistic regression model tested whether patient vulnerability (ie, women, older age, racial/ethnic minority, rural residence, homeless, and justice-involved) and facility (eg, regional location, availability of a methadone clinic) characteristics were associated with medication receipt. Among the 53,568 veterans at VHA facilities diagnosed with opioid use disorder in Fiscal Year 2017, vulnerable populations - including women, older, Black, rural, homeless, and justice-involved veterans - had lower odds of receiving medications for opioid use disorder than their nonvulnerable counterparts. Veterans had higher odds of receiving medications at facilities with a higher proportion of patients with opioid use disorder, but lower odds of receiving medications at facilities in the Southern region compared to the Northeast region of the United States. Quality improvement efforts targeted at vulnerable populations are needed at the VHA to ensure these groups receive the same quality of substance use disorder treatment as other veterans.",Access To Medicines;Addiction Medicine;Administration;Aged;Blacks;Ethnic Groups;Female;Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Justice;Logistic Regression;Measures;Methadone;Minority Groups;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Population;Quality Improvement;Societies;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health;Vulnerable Populations;Women,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
32947174,2020,Opioid initiation and injection transition in rural northern New England: A mixed-methods approach.,"In rural northern New England, located in the northeastern United States, the overdose epidemic has accelerated with the introduction of fentanyl. Opioid initiation and transition to opioid injection have been studied in urban settings. Little is known about opioid initiation and transition to injection drug use in rural northern New England. This mixed-methods study characterized opioid use and drug injection in 11 rural counties in Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire between 2018 and 2019. People who use drugs completed audio computer-assisted self-interview surveys on substance use and risk behaviors (n = 589) and shared personal narratives through in-depth interviews (n = 22). The objective of the current study is to describe initiation of opioid use and drug injection in rural northern New England. Median age of first injection was 22 years (interquartile range 18-28 years). Key themes from in-depth interviews that led to initiating drug injection included normalization of drug use in families and communities, experiencing trauma, and abrupt discontinuation of an opioid prescription. Other factors that led to a transition to injecting included lower cost, increased effect/ rush, greater availability of heroin/ fentanyl, and faster relief of withdrawal symptoms with injection. Trauma, normalization of drug use, over-prescribing of opioids, and abrupt discontinuation challenge people who use drugs in rural northern New England communities. Inadequate opioid tapering may increase transition to non-prescribed drug use. The extent and severity of traumatic experiences described highlights the importance of enhancing trauma-informed care in rural areas.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Computers;Cost;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Family;Female;Fentanyl;Heroin;Humans;Injections;Interview;Male;Massachusetts;Methods;New England;New Hampshire;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Over Prescribing;Personal Narrative;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Risk Behavior;Rural Population;Self;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Vermont;Withdrawal Symptoms;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult","Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms;Wounds and Injuries",Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33242292,2021,Prevalence and Correlates of Cannabis Use in Massachusetts after Cannabis Legalization and before Retail Sales.,"We determined the prevalence and correlates of cannabis use in Massachusetts after recreational use was passed, but before recreational cannabis stores opened. A cross-sectional, population-based survey of Massachusetts adults, age 18 years or older, (n = 3,022) was conducted in November-December, 2017. We estimated population-level prevalence and correlates of past 30-day cannabis use. 21.1% [95% CI: 18.6, 23.6] of Massachusetts adults reported past 30-day cannabis use. Among cannabis users, 56.0% [CI 49.1, 62.9] reported non-medical cannabis use, 15.5% [12.1, 18.9] reported medical cannabis use, and 28.5% [CI 22.3, 34.8] reported both types of use. Men were more likely than women to use cannabis (Risk Ratio: 1.3 [CI 1.1, 1.6]), as were young adults (18-25 years old), those with lower socioeconomic status, non-parenting individuals, those who used alcohol (1.9 [CI 1.4, 2.6]) or other substances (1.7 [CI 1.3, 2.4]), and residents of Western Massachusetts (2.0 [1.3, 3.0]; ref: Boston area), the Northeast (1.8 [CI 1.2, 2.7]), and the Southeast (1.8 [CI 1.1, 2.7]). Cannabis is widely used in Massachusetts, with varying prevalence rates by gender, age, socioeconomic status, poly-substance use, and region. Findings may inform public health efforts and serve as a baseline for measuring health and social impacts of opening retail cannabis stores.","Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Boston;Cannabis;Cross-Sectional Studies;Gender;Health;Humans;Legislation, Drug;Massachusetts;Medical Marijuana;Men;Odds Ratio;Parenting;Population;Prevalence;Public Health;Sales;Social Impact;Socioeconomic Status;Substance Use;Surveys;Women;Young Adult",Substance Use,J Psychoactive Drugs,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33288348,2021,COVID-19 and treating incarcerated populations for opioid use disorder.,"The Franklin County Sheriff's Office (FCSO), in Greenfield, Massachusetts, is among the first jails nationwide to provide correctional populations with access to all three medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD, i.e., buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FCSO quickly implemented comprehensive mitigation policies and adapted MOUD programming. Two major challenges for implementation of the MOUD program were the mandated rapid release of nonviolent pretrial individuals, many of whom were being treated with MOUD and released too quickly to conduct continuity of care planning; and establishing how to deliver physically distanced MOUD services in jail. FCSO implemented and adapted a hub-and-spoke MOUD model, developed telehealth capacity, and experimented with take-home MOUD at release to facilitate continuity-of-care as individuals re-entered the community. Experiences underscore how COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and diffusion of technology-infused OUD treatment and other innovations in criminal justice settings. Looking forward, to address both opioid use disorder and COVID-19, jails and prisons need to develop capacity to implement mitigation strategies, including universal and rapid COVID-19 testing of staff and incarcerated individuals, and be resourced to provide evidence-based addiction treatment. FCSO quickly pivoted and adapted MOUD programming because of its history of applying public health approaches to address the opioid epidemic. Utilizing public health strategies can enable prisons and jails to mitigate the harms of the co-occurring epidemics of OUD and COVID-19, both of which disproportionately affect criminal justice populations, for persons who are incarcerated and the communities to which they return.",Address;Affect;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;COVID-19 Testing;Community;Continuity of Patient Care;Criminal Justice;Diffusion;Epidemics;History;Humans;Jails;Massachusetts;Methadone;Naltrexone;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Policy;Population;Prisoners;Prisons;Program;Public Health;Technology;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Therapeutics,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33339633,2021,A clinical protocol of a comparative effectiveness trial of extended-release naltrexone versus extended-release buprenorphine with individuals leaving jail.,"This study is a randomized, open label, controlled trial of extended-release buprenorphine (XR-B; BRIXADI™ formulation) versus extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in Maryland jails. A 7-site, open-label, equivalence design will randomly assign 240 adults with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD), stratified by gender and jail, who are nearing release to one of two treatment arms: 1) XR-B in jail or 2) XR-NTX in jail, both followed by 6 monthly injections postrelease at a community treatment program. The primary aim is to determine the rate of pharmacotherapy adherence (number of monthly injections received) of XR-B compared to XR-NTX. The proposed study is innovative because it will be the first randomized clinical trial in the U.S. assessing the effectiveness of receiving XR-B vs. XR-NTX in county jails. The public health impact of the study will be highly significant and far-reaching because most individuals with OUD do not receive treatment while incarcerated, thereby substantially raising their likelihood of relapse to drug use, overdose death, and re-incarceration. Understanding how to expand acceptance of medications for OUD in jails, particularly extended-release medications, and supporting treatment engagement and medication adherence in transition to the community, has far-reaching implications for improving treatment access and success in this population.","Adult;Arm;Buprenorphine;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trial;Community;Comprehension;Death;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Therapy;Gender;History;Humans;Injections;Injections, Intramuscular;Jails;Justice;Maryland;Medication Adherence;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Program;Public Health;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Relapse;Therapeutics",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The overall goal of the project is to increase initiation and maintenance of MOUD among high-risk justice-involved women during community reentry to reduce opioid relapse and overdose. This project and other studies through the JCOIN network have the potential to significantly impact the OUD treatment field by contributing empirical evidence about the effectiveness and implementation of innovative technologies to increase initiation and maintenance of MOUD during a critical, high-risk time of community reentry among vulnerable, justice-involved individuals in both urban and nonurban communities.","Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Cost Effectiveness;Female;Goals;Humans;Hybrids;Jails;Jurisprudence;Justice;Kentucky;Maintenance;Offenders;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Relapse;Research;Risk;Technology;Telehealth;Therapeutics;Time;Women",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The RMC-A experiment will test an adapted version of the evidence-based Recovery Management Checkups (RMC), which provides treatment linkage, support for retention, and re-linkage as indicated at quarterly checkups. A total of 750 male and female individuals will be recruited from 5 county jails in Illinois and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups at release from jail: a) Monitoring and Treatment Referral (MTR); b) quarterly RMC (RMC-Q); or c) RMC-A, which adjusts the frequency and intensity of checkups based on the individual's assessed need for treatment at each checkup. Measurement includes quarterly research follow-up assessments for 2 years, urine tests, and records checks (treatment, mortality, recidivism). The study aims to evaluate: (1) the direct effects of RMC-Q/RMC-A on MOUD treatment initiation, engagement, retention, and re-linkage; (2) the indirect effects of RMC-Q/RMC-A (via months of MOUD) on public health outcomes (days of opioid use, OUD symptoms, quality of life, cost of health care utilization); (3) the indirect effects of RMC-Q/RMC-A (via months of MOUD and public health outcomes) on public safety outcomes (illegal activity, re-arrest, re-incarceration, cost of crime); and (4) the incremental costs and cost-effectiveness of MTR vs. RMC-Q vs. RMC-A on public health and public safety outcomes.

33483222,2021,Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN).,"A major driver of the U.S. opioid crisis is limited access to effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that reduce overdose risks. Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U.S. have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose. A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming. MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim. The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Community;Cost;Criminal Justice;Economic Evaluation;Form;Goals;Humans;Hybrids;Jails;Justice;Law;Massachusetts;Methadone;Naltrexone;News;Occupational Groups;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Pilots;Policy;Policy Makers;Prisons;Program;Public Health;Recidivism;Research;Research Activities;Risk;SARS-CoV-2;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The new court model is now being rolled out statewide yet, given the innovation of the opioid court, the exact barriers to implementation in different counties with a range of resources are largely unknown. We describe a study protocol for the development and efficacy-test of a new implementation intervention (Opioid Court REACH; Research on Evidence-Based Approaches to Court Health) that will allow the opioid court, as framed by the 10 Essential Elements, to be scaled-up across 10 counties in NYS. Using a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, we will test: (a) the implementation impact of Opioid Court REACH in improving implementation outcomes along the opioid cascade of care (screening, referral, treatment enrollment, MOUD initiation), and (b) the clinical and cost effectiveness of Opioid Court REACH in improving public health (treatment retention/court graduation) and public safety (recidivism) outcomes. Opioid Court REACH has the potential to improve management of individuals with opioid addiction in the court system via widespread scale-up of the opioid court model across the U.S., should this study find it to be effective.","Address;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Cost Effectiveness;Elements;Health;Humans;Hybrids;Implementation Science;Needs;New York;News;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Randomized Controlled Trial;Recidivism;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Research;Resources;Safety;Scales;Screening;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

We conducted next-generation sequencing of HCV and analyzed it for phylogenetic linkage by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Global Hepatitis Outbreak Surveillance Technology platform. Analysis showed that 126 persons were linked across 42 clusters. Phylogenetic clustering was higher in rural communities and associated with female sex and younger age among rural residents. These data highlight that HCV transmission could be reduced by expanding molecular-based surveillance strategies to rural communities affected by the opioid crisis.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Community;Correctional Facilities;Disease Outbreaks;Drug Users;Epidemics;Epidemiology;Female;Genomics;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Humans;Injections;Laboratories;Molecular Epidemiology;Opioid Crisis;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phylogenetic Clustering;Phylogeny;Prisons;Program;Public Health;RNA;Retrospective Studies;Rural Communities;Sex;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Syringes;Technology;United States;Viruses;Wisconsin","Hepatitis;Hepatitis C;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Emerg Infect Dis,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33565117,2021,Increasing Medicaid enrollment among formerly incarcerated adults.,"To estimate the incremental associations between the implementation of expanded Medicaid eligibility and prerelease Medicaid enrollment assistance on Medicaid enrollment for recently incarcerated adults. Data include person-level merged, longitudinal data from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and the Wisconsin Medicaid program from 2013 to 2015. We use an interrupted time series design to estimate the association between each of two natural experiments and Medicaid enrollment for recently incarcerated adults. First, in April 2014 the Wisconsin Medicaid program expanded eligibility to include all adults with income at or below 100% of the federal poverty level. Second, in January 2015, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections implemented prerelease Medicaid enrollment assistance at all state correctional facilities. We collected Medicaid enrollment, and state prison administrative and risk assessment data for all nonelderly adults incarcerated by the state who were released between January 2013 and December 2015. The full sample includes 24 235 individuals. Adults with a history of substance use comprise our secondary sample. This sample includes 12 877 individuals. The primary study outcome is Medicaid enrollment within the month of release. Medicaid enrollment in the month of release from state prison grew from 8 percent of adults at baseline to 36 percent after the eligibility expansion (P-value &lt; .01) and to 61 percent (P-value &lt; .01) after the introduction of enrollment assistance. Results were similar for adults with a history of substance use. Black adults were 3.5 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid in the month of release than White adults (P-value &lt; .01).

33579622,2021,"Opioid Use Disorder Stigma, Discrimination, and Policy Attitudes in a National Sample of U.S. Young Adults.","A small fraction of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) receives appropriate care. Public opinion about addiction contributes to the availability and accessibility of effective treatment services. Little is known about such attitudes toward OUD among young adults, a population at heightened risk for OUD onset. The current study examined endorsement of social stigma, discrimination, and policy attitudes about OUD and hypothesized correlates of such attitudes (familiarity with OUD, criminal justice involvement, respondent demographic characteristics). A national sample of 190 young adults (weighted n = 408; 69% female, 42% White, non-Hispanic) aged 19-29 years completed web and telephone surveys covering opioid social stigma, discrimination, policy attitudes, personal experience with opioids, and criminal justice, and participant characteristics (age, sex, race, education, employment, income). Linear regressions were performed to examine associations between respondent characteristics and attitudes. Young adults, on average, endorsed moderate levels of stigma and discrimination toward people with OUD and support for treatment-oriented policies. Stigma was positively associated with discrimination and negatively associated with support for policies favorable to people with OUD. Regression results revealed that more negative attitudes toward OUD were endorsed as a function of older age and less personal experience or familiarity with OUD. Heterogeneity in young adults' attitudes about OUD may be explained, in part, by personal characteristics and familiarity with OUD. Adolescence may be an opportune developmental period to prevent or reduce public stigma related to OUD and MOUD and increase public attitudes in support of expanded access to effective OUD treatments.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Attitude;Criminal Justice;Demography;Education;Employment;Familiarity;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Income;Linear Regression;Male;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Policy;Population;Public Opinion;Racial Stocks;Respondents;Risk;Sex;Social Stigma;Surveys;Telephone;Therapeutics;Whites;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Adolesc Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33583610,2021,"The Transitions Clinic Network: Post Incarceration Addiction Treatment, Healthcare, and Social Support (TCN-PATHS): A hybrid type-1 effectiveness trial of enhanced primary care to improve opioid use disorder treatment outcomes following release from jail.","In 2016, at least 20% of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) were involved in the criminal justice system, with the majority of individuals cycling through jails. Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death and a common cause of morbidity after release from incarceration. Medications for OUD (MOUD) are effective at reducing overdoses, but few interventions have successfully engaged and retained individuals after release from incarceration in treatment. To assess whether follow-up care in the Transitions Clinic Network (TCN), which provides OUD treatment and enhanced primary care for people released from incarceration, improves key measures in the opioid treatment cascade after release from jail. In TCN programs, primary care teams include a community health worker with a history of incarceration, and they attend to social needs, such as housing, food insecurity, and criminal legal system contact, along with patients' medical needs. We will bring together six correctional systems and community health centers with TCN programs to conduct a hybrid type-1 effectiveness/implementation study among individuals who were released from jail on MOUD. We will randomize 800 individuals on MOUD released from seven local jails (Bridgeport, CT; Niantic, CT; Bronx, NY; Caguas, PR; Durham, NC; Minneapolis, MN; Ontario County, NY) to compare the effectiveness of a TCN intervention versus referral to standard primary care to improve measures within the opioid treatment cascade. We will also determine what social determinants of health are mediating any observed associations between assignment to the TCN program and opioid treatment cascade measures. Last, we will study the cost effectiveness of the approach, as well as individual, organizational, and policy-level barriers and facilitators to successfully transitioning individuals on MOUD from jail to the TCN. Investigation Review Board the University of North Carolina (IRB Study # 19-1713), the Office of Human Research Protections, and the NIDA JCOIN Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the study.

33618744,2021,A scoping review of factors that influence opioid overdose prevention for justice-involved populations.,"There is a high risk of death from opioid overdose following release from prison. Efforts to develop and implement overdose prevention programs for justice-involved populations have increased in recent years. An understanding of the gaps in knowledge on prevention interventions is needed to accelerate development, implementation, and dissemination of effective strategies. A systematic search process identified 43 published papers addressing opioid overdose prevention in criminal justice settings or among justice-involved populations from 2010 to February 2020. Cross-cutting themes were identified, coded and qualitatively analyzed. Papers were coded into five categories: acceptability (n = 8), accessibility (n = 4), effectiveness (n = 5), feasibility (n = 7), and participant overdose risk (n = 19). Common themes were: (1) Acceptability of naloxone is associated with injection drug use, overdose history, and perceived risk within the situational context; (2) Accessibility of naloxone is a function of the interface between corrections and community; (3) Evaluations of overdose prevention interventions are few, but generally show increases in knowledge or reductions in opioid overdose; (4) Coordinated efforts are needed to implement prevention interventions, address logistical challenges, and develop linkages between corrections and community providers; (5) Overdose is highest immediately following release from prison or jail, often preceded by service-system interactions, and associated with drug-use severity, injection use, and mental health disorders, as well as risks in the post-release environment. Study findings can inform the development of overdose prevention interventions that target justice-involved individuals and policies to support their implementation across criminal justice and community-based service systems.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Classification;Community;Comprehension;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Death;Drug Overdose;Environment;Harm Reduction;History;Humans;Injections;Jails;Justice;Knowledge;Mental Health;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paper;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prisons;Program;Review;Risk",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33741216,2021,Using implementation interventions and peer recovery support to improve opioid treatment outcomes in community supervision: Protocol.,"The purpose is to determine whether a facilitated local change team (LCT) intervention improves linkage to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and implementation outcomes, and whether participant-level outcomes are further enhanced by use of peer support specialists (PSS). This Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves a pre-post design (implementation study) followed by a randomized trial of PSS (effectiveness study). Participants are at least 114 justice and service staff from 7 sites in three states: probation officers, community treatment providers, a supervisor from each agency, and key stakeholders. The study will recruit up to 680 individuals on probation from seven adult community probation offices; eligible individuals will be recently committed, English speakers, with opioid use disorder (OUD). Core Implementation Study: The study will use the exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainability (EPIS) framework to guide system-change through facilitated LCTs of probation and community treatment staff given a core set of implementation strategies to set goals. The study will collect program-level and staff survey data at the end of each EPIS stage. Implementation outcomes: Organizational engagement in MOUD (primary), plus changes in staff knowledge/attitudes and organizational outcomes (secondary). Effectiveness Study of PSS: After completing implementation, the study will randomize adults on probation to receive PSS vs. treatment as usual, with assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Effectiveness outcomes include participant engagement in MOUD (primary), probation revocation, illicit opioid use, and overdoses. Other aims include identifying barriers and facilitators, and cost-benefit analysis of PSS.

Case management and peer recovery coaching are established interventions that may be leveraged to improve linkage to substance use treatment and supportive services during these critical periods of transition. We present the protocol for the Reducing Opioid Mortality in Illinois (ROMI), a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized trial of a case management, peer recovery coaching and overdose education and naloxone distribution (CM/PRC + OEND) critical time intervention (CTI) compared to OEND alone. The CM/PRC + OEND is a novel, 12-month intervention that involves linkage to substance use treatment and support for continuity of care, skills building, and navigation and engagement of social services that will be implemented using a hub-and-spoke model of training and supervision across the study sites. At least 1000 individuals released from jails and prisons spanning urban and rural settings will be enrolled. The primary outcome is engagement in medication for opioid use disorder. Secondary outcomes include health insurance enrollment, mental health service engagement, and re-arrest/recidivism, parole violation, and/or reincarceration. Mixed methods will be used to evaluate process and implementation outcomes including fidelity to, barriers to, facilitators of, and cost of the intervention. Videoconferencing and other remote processes will be leveraged to modify the protocol for safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

33762145,2021,Fostering MOUD use in justice populations: Assessing the comparative effectiveness of two favored implementation strategies to increase MOUD use.,"Coaching is a favored strategy for the implementation of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), yet research has not adequately tested or assessed coaching dosages and mediums for overall effectiveness, nor have coaching doses been widely studied within criminal justice settings (CJS). Scaling up the use of MOUD, particularly in CJS, presents a challenge given the stigmatization of substance use disorder, funding for MOUD, availability and capacity of community-based treatment providers, leadership support, and the historical preference for behavioral therapy-based treatment practices. The University of Wisconsin's Center for Health Enhancement and Systems Studies (CHESS) and George Mason University's Center for Advancing Correctional Excellence! (ACE!) are conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal combination and dosages for two different coaching strategies to disseminate MOUD in justice-involved populations; those strategies are the NIATx model for process improvement and Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model. NIATx coaches provide technical assistance in MOUD implementation and organizational change to help justice and treatment organizations to implement and disseminate MOUD for justice clients. The ECHO platform focuses primarily on the clinical provider by connecting the provider with expert MOUD prescribers to promote high-quality MOUD practices. The trial will have four study arms that compare high-dose and low-dose coaching, with and without ECHO. This will be the first trial that assesses the comparative effectiveness of two types of coaching methods at varying dosages for justice-involved individuals. The trial will be conducted with 48 jails and community-based treatment provider sites that handle justice-involved persons with opioid use disorder (OUD).","Arm;Behavior Therapy;Change, Organizational;Clients;Coaching;Community;Community Health Care;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Fostering;Health;Health Services;Humans;Jails;Justice;Leadership;Methods;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Organizations;Overall;Persons;Population;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Stigmatization;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Universities;Wisconsin",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
33765861,2021,The Missing Link(age): Multilevel Contributors to Service Uptake Failure Among Youths on Community Justice Supervision.,"Youths in the juvenile justice system often do not access needed behavioral health services. The behavioral health services cascade model was used to examine rates of substance use screening, identification of substance use treatment needs, and referral to and initiation of treatment among youths undergoing juvenile justice system intake and to identify when treatment access is most challenged. Characteristics associated with identification of behavioral health needs and linkage to community services were also examined. Data were drawn from administrative records of 33 community justice agencies in seven states participating in Juvenile Justice-Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (N=8,307 youths). Contributions of youth, staff, agency, and county characteristics to identification of behavioral health needs and linkage to community services were examined. More than 70% (5,942 of 8,307) of youths were screened for substance use problems, and more than half needed treatment. Among those in need, only about one-fifth were referred to treatment, and among those referred, 67.5% initiated treatment. Overall, &lt;10% of youths with identified needs initiated services. Multivariable multilevel regression analyses revealed several contributors to service-related outcomes, with youths' level of supervision being among the strongest predictors of treatment referral. Community justice agencies appear to follow an approach that focuses identification and linkage practices on concerns other than youths' behavioral health needs, although such needs contribute to reoffending. Local agencies should coordinate efforts to support interagency communication in the referral and cross-system linkage process.","Adolescent;Communication;Community;Delivery of Health Care;Health;Health Services;Humans;Justice;Juvenile Delinquency;Mass Screening;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Needs;Overall;Records;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Regression Analysis;Screening;Services, Community;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Supervision;Therapeutics;Translational Research;Youth",Drug Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Psychiatr Serv,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

34080564,2021,Strategies to improve implementation of medications for opioid use disorder reported by veterans involved in the legal system: A qualitative study.,"Veterans involved in the legal system have a high risk of overdose mortality but limited utilization of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). To increase the use of MOUD in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and reduce overdose mortality, the VHA should incorporate strategies identified by legal-involved veterans to improve quality of care and ensure that their patients' experiences are integrated into care delivery. This study aims to determine strategies to increase use of MOUD from the perspective of legal-involved veterans with a history of opioid use or opioid use disorder (OUD). Between February 2018 and March 2019, we conducted semistructured interviews with 18 veterans with a history of opioid use or OUD and legal involvement (15 men and 3 women; mean age 41, standard deviation 13, range 28-61). Veterans were from 9 geographically dispersed United States VHA facilities. The study analyzed verbatim transcripts using the framework method. The primary focus was themes that represented legal-involved veteran-identified strategies to improve the use of MOUD. The 18 veterans interviewed had legal involvement directly related to their opioid use and most (n = 15; 83%) had previously used MOUD. Veteran-identified strategies to improve access to and use of MOUD included: (1) VHA should provide transportation or telehealth services; (2) legal agencies should increase access to MOUD during incarceration; (3) the VHA should reduce physician turnover; (4) the VHA should improve physician education to deliver compassionate, patient-centered treatment; (5) the VHA should improve veteran education about MOUD; and (6) the VHA should provide social support opportunities to veterans. Legal-involved veterans provided strategies that can inform and expand MOUD to better meet their needs and the treatment needs of all patients with OUD. The VHA should consider incorporating these strategies into care, and should evaluate their impact on patients' experience, initiation of and retention on medications, and overdose rates.",Administration;Adult;Criminal Justice;Drug Overdose;Drug Therapy;Education;Female;History;Humans;Interview;Male;Men;Methods;Mortality;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Physicians;Qualitative Research;Quality of Health Care;Risk;Social Support;Standards;Telehealth;Therapeutics;Transportation;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health;Women,Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34116811,2021,Screening for more with less: Validation of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Quick v3 (GAIN-Q3) screeners.,"Multi-morbidity is the norm among adolescents and adults with substance use and other mental disorders and warrants a multi-pronged screening approach. However, the time constraints on assessment inherent in clinical practice often temper the desire for a full understanding of multi-morbidity problems. The 15- to 25-minute Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Quick version 3 (GAIN-Q3) includes screeners for 9 common clinical problems that are short (4 to 10 items) and provide dimensional measures of problem severity in each area that are also categorized to guide clinical decision making. The screeners are summed into a total score that represents a 10th screener for multi-morbidity. This paper provides background on the development of the GAIN-Q3 screeners, their psychometric behaviors, efficiency, and predictive power relative to the 1-2 h full GAIN-I. Based on literature showing differential item and scale functioning by age, analyses were conducted separately using data from 10,625 adolescent and 10,167 adult treatment clients. Despite the condensed lengths of the screening measures compared with their longer versions, the reliability estimates are within the good to excellent range (0.7 to 0.9) in terms of internal consistency for 6 of the 10 screeners for adolescents and 7 of the 10 screeners for adults. In addition, the part to whole correlation for all 10 comparisons for both adolescents and adults are excellent (0.82 to 0.96). Moreover, there is strong evidence for the measures' convergent and discriminant validity and efficiency (i.e., maximum information gathered in as few items possible) relative to the full-length scales as well as relative to other scales in the full GAIN-I. Analyses of the interpretive cut-scores provide accurate identification of cases with high sensitivity and specificity, thus supporting the screeners' capacity to triage. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study reports on the ability (GAIN-Q3) to efficiently screen for multiple co-occurring substance use, mental health, and associated problems. Multi-problem presentation in the social service sector is the normal expectation, yet time constraints prevent broad assessment of potentially many problematic areas. The GAIN-Q3 showed convergent and discriminant validity relative to the full-length scales as well as other scales assessed in the GAIN-I. The GAIN-Q3 achieves the desired balance between broad coverage and measurement efficiency to provide ample information to identify the best course of action for an individual.","Ability;Adolescent;Adult;Behavior;Clients;Clinical Decision-Making;Comprehension;Efficiency;Expectations;Health;Humans;Literature;Mass Screening;Measures;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Morbidity;Needs;Paper;Power, Psychological;Psychometrics;Relatives;Report;Reproducibility of Results;Scales;Screening;Sensitivity and Specificity;Social Work;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Triage",Mental Disorders;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34304335,2021,The impact of the opioid crisis on U.S. state prison systems.,"Prior studies have documented limited use of medications to treat opioid use disorders (OUD) for people incarcerated within state prisons in the United States. Using the framework of the criminal justice OUD service cascade, this study interviewed representatives of prison systems in states most heavily impacted by opioid overdose regarding the provision of medications for OUD (MOUD). A stratified sampling strategy included states with high indicators of opioid-overdose deaths. Two sampling strata targeted states with: 1) OUD overdose rates significantly higher than the per capita national average; or 2) high absolute number of OUD overdose fatalities. Interviews were completed with representatives from 21 of the 23 (91%) targeted states in 2019, representing 583 prisons across these states. Interviews assessed service provision across the criminal justice OUD service cascade, including OUD screening, withdrawal management, MOUD availability and provision, overdose prevention, re-entry services, barriers, and needs for training and technical assistance. MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone) was available in at least one prison in approximately 90% of the state prison systems and all three medications were available in at least one prison in 62% of systems. However, MOUD provision was limited to subsets of prisons within these systems: 15% provided buprenorphine, 9% provided methadone, 36% provided naltrexone, and only 7% provided all three. Buprenorphine and methadone were most frequently provided to pregnant women or individuals already receiving these at admission, whereas naltrexone was primarily used at release. Funding was the most frequently cited barrier for all medications. Study findings yield a complex picture of how, when, and to whom MOUD is provided across prisons within prison systems in states most heavily impacted by opioid overdose in the United States and have implications for expanding availability.",Buprenorphine;Criminal Justice;Death;Indicators;Interview;Methadone;Naltrexone;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Persons;Pregnant Women;Prisons;Screening;United States,Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

34339247,2021,Changes In Health Services Use After Receipt Of Medications For Opioid Use Disorder In A Statewide Correctional System.,"To decrease opioid overdose mortality, prisons and jails in the US are increasingly offering medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) to incarcerated people. It is unknown how receipt of these medications in a correctional setting affects health services use after release. In this article we analyze changes in postrelease health care use after the implementation of a statewide medications for OUD program in the unified jail and prison system of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Using Medicaid claims data, we examined individual health care use in the community before and after receipt of medications for OUD while incarcerated. We found that inpatient admissions did not change, emergency department visits decreased, and both nonacute outpatient services and pharmacy claims increased after people received medications for OUD while incarcerated. There was no change in total health care costs paid by Medicaid. Our findings provide evidence that people's use of health care services paid for by Medicaid did not increase after they started medications for OUD in correctional settings. Given the frequent interaction of people with OUD with the criminal justice system, offering evidence-based treatment of OUD in correctional settings is an important opportunity to initiate addiction treatment.","Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Criminal Justice;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Health Services;Health Services, Outpatient;Hospitalization;Humans;Inpatients;Jails;Medicaid;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Pharmacy;Prisons;Program;Rhode Island;Therapeutics;United States",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Health Aff (Millwood),New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34586978,2022,A national survey of barriers and facilitators to medications for opioid use disorder among legal-involved veterans in the Veterans Health Administration.,"Background: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are clinically effective at treating OUD among legal-involved populations. However, research shows that legal-involved veterans who receive care through the VHA have lower rates of MOUD use compared to non-legal-involved veterans. Education may be a key factor in intervention strategies to improve MOUD access. This study was a national survey of VHA staff to identify barriers to and facilitators of MOUD, as well as MOUD-related education needs for VHA staff, community partners, criminal justice partners, and legal-involved veterans. Method: A 98-item online survey was conducted to examine VHA staff perspectives (N = 218) around needed education, barriers to, and facilitators of MOUD for legal-involved veterans. Descriptive statistics were conducted and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate differences in perceptions by respondents' current position at the VHA and their VHA facility's rate of provision of MOUD among legal-involved veterans. Results: Respondents endorsed a need for education in all areas of MOUD (e.g., existing medications for the treatment of OUD) for VHA staff and providers, community partners, criminal justice partners, and legal-involved veterans. VHA staff perceived barriers to MOUD for legal-involved veterans to include stigma and complicated guidelines around MOUD and OUD treatment. Facilities with low rates of MOUD use highlighted barriers including MOUD conflicting with the philosophy of the local VHA facility and provider stigma toward patients with OUD. Perceptions of efficacy of MOUD differed by respondents' current position at the VHA such that substance use disorder treatment providers perceived buprenorphine and methadone as more effective compared to Veterans Justice Specialists. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a need for an educational intervention emphasizing the evidence supporting use of MOUD as a lack of knowledge about these medications was considered a barrier to access, whereas gaining education about MOUD was a facilitator to access. Education strategies specifically tailored to address VHA facility-level differences may help address barriers to MOUD experienced by legal-involved veterans.",Address;Administration;Buprenorphine;Community;Criminal Justice;Education;Guideline;Humans;Justice;Knowledge;Linear Regression;Medication Assisted Treatment of Opioid;Methadone;Methods;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Perception;Philosophy;Population;Research;Respondents;Specialists;Statistics;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Veterans;Veterans Health,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34644126,2022,Drivers of County Engagement in Criminal Justice-Behavioral Health Initiatives.,"Several large, county-level initiatives are underway to improve behavioral health care for justice-involved clients. Unfortunately, only about a quarter of counties participate in these efforts, leaving justice-involved populations at risk of poor mental health, substance use, and judicial outcomes. This study examined characteristics of 2,922 U.S. counties and county equivalents by whether they participated in these initiatives and found that crime and socioeconomic characteristics were not associated with participation. Participating counties had significantly more robust mental health and substance use care delivery systems. Nonparticipating counties may lack the expertise and basic delivery system prerequisites needed for participation in most national initiatives, further driving geographic disparities.",Clients;Crime;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Health;Health Care;Humans;Jails;Justice;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;Outpatients;Population at Risk;Prisons;Psychiatry;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics,Mental Disorders;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Psychiatr Serv,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
34930575,2022,Treatment preference for opioid use disorder among people who are incarcerated.,"The devastating overdose crisis remains a leading cause of death in the United States, especially among individuals involved in the criminal legal system. Currently, three classes (opioid agonist, partial agonist-antagonist, and antagonist) of FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) exist, yet few correctional settings offer any medication treatment for people who are incarcerated. Facilities that do often provide only one medication. We conducted 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with individuals receiving MOUD incarcerated at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Results from this study indicate that people who are incarcerated have preferences for certain types of MOUD. Individuals' preferences were influenced by medication side effects, route of administration, delivery in the community, and stigma. MOUD programs in the community and in correctional settings should use a patient-centered approach that allows choice of medication by offering all FDA-approved MOUD treatment options.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cause of Death;Community;Criminals;Drug Overdose;Humans;Interview;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Partial Opioid Agonists;Patient Preference;Patients;Persons;Prisoners;Program;Rhode Island;Social Stigma;Therapeutics;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35012792,2022,Scoping review of interventions to link individuals to substance use services at discharge from jail.,"Individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) must be linked to community-based SUD treatment and other services upon their release from jail, given their high service needs and risks for relapse, recidivism, and opioid-related overdose following release. This scoping review identified 14 studies (28 affiliated publications) that used experimental or quasi-experimental designs to evaluate jail re-entry interventions for individuals with SUD. The team coded intervention components, study characteristics, and study outcomes based on a service continuum for treatment linkage and retention and for post-release substance use and criminal justice outcomes. This review included 4 randomized controlled trials (RCT) for linkage to treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD); 4 RCTs and 4 quasi-experimental studies for linkage to non-specific SUD treatment; and 2 RCTs for linkage to HIV + SUD services. Most studies (9/14) used case management and/or peer or patient navigation as the core intervention; 2 studies provided medical management for MOUD induction and/or facilitated referral to MOUD in the community; and 3 studies used motivational-based linkage interventions. A qualitative analysis of study outcomes found evidence to support the effectiveness of a diverse range of interventions to link individuals to community-based SUD treatment, MOUD, and other services at re-entry, but limited support for intervention effects on longer-term outcomes, including treatment retention, medication adherence, recidivism, and substance use. Future controlled trials and implementation studies should help to unpack and examine core components of jail re-entry interventions and their successful implementation to enhance treatment retention and improve post-release outcomes.",Case Management;Community;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Experimental Design;Future;HIV;Humans;Jails;Medication Adherence;Needs;Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Patient Discharge;Patient Navigation;Publications;Randomized Controlled Trial;Recidivism;Referral;Relapse;Review;Risk;Study Characteristics;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35063323,2022,Recidivism and mortality after in-jail buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder.,"Buprenorphine is an effective medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) when offered in community-based settings, but evidence is limited for incarcerated populations, particularly in relation to recidivism. In Massachusetts, Franklin County jail (FCSO) was among the first to provide buprenorphine; adjacent Hampshire County jail (HCHC) offered it more recently. These jails present a natural experiment to determine whether outcomes are different between individuals who did and did not have the opportunity to receive buprenorphine in jail. We examined outcomes of all incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder (n = 469) who did (FCSO n = 197) and did not (HCHC n = 272) have the opportunity to receive buprenorphine. The primary outcome was post-release recidivism, defined as time from jail exit to a recidivism event (incarceration, probation violation, arraignment). Using Cox proportional hazards models, we investigated site as a predictor, controlling for covariates. We also examined post-release deaths. Fewer FCSO than HCHC individuals recidivated (48.2% vs. 62.5%; p = 0.001); fewer FCSO individuals were re-arraigned (36.0% vs. 47.1%; p = 0.046) or re-incarcerated (21.3% vs. 39.0%; p &lt; 0.0001). Recidivism risk was lower in the FCSO group (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.56, 0.89; p = 0.003), net of covariates (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.53, 0.86; p = 0.001). At each site, 3% of participants died. Among incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder, risk of recidivism after jail exit is lower among those who were offered buprenorphine during incarceration. Findings support the growing movement in jails nationwide to offer buprenorphine and other agonist medications for opioid use disorder.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Community;Confidence Intervals;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Criminal Justice;Death;Humans;Jails;Justice;Massachusetts;Mortality;Movement;Naltrexone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Population;Recidivism;Risk;Therapeutics;Time",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35080937,2022,"Opioid Overdose Deaths Among Formerly Incarcerated Persons and the General Population: North Carolina, 2000‒2018.","Objectives. To compare opioid overdose death (OOD) rates among formerly incarcerated persons (FIPs) from 2016 to 2018 with the North Carolina population and with OOD rates from 2000 to 2015. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 259 861 North Carolina FIPs from 2000 to 2018 linked with North Carolina death records. We used indirectly standardized OOD mortality rates and ratios and present 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. From 2017 to 2018, the OOD rates in the North Carolina general population decreased by 10.1% but increased by 32% among FIPs. During 2016 to 2018, the highest substance-specific OOD rate among FIPs was attributable to synthetic narcotics (mainly fentanyl and its analogs), while OOD rates for other opioids were half or less than that from synthetic narcotics. During 2016 to 2018, the OOD risk for FIPs from synthetic narcotics was 50.3 (95% CI = 30.9, 69.6), 20.2 (95% CI = 17.3, 23.2), and 18.2 (95% CI = 15.9, 20.5) times as high as that for the North Carolina population at 2-week, 1-year, and complete follow-up after release, respectively. Conclusions. While nationwide OOD rates declined from 2017 to 2018, OOD rates among North Carolina FIPs increased by about a third, largely from fentanyl and its analogs.

35249789,2022,Uncommon and preventable: Perceptions of diversion of medication for opioid use disorder in jail.,"Correctional officials often cite diversion of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment (e.g., buprenorphine) as a reason for not offering MOUD treatment in jails and prisons, but it is poorly understood whether these fears are justified. We aimed to understand staff perceptions of medication diversion from jail-based MOUD programs and the factors that contribute to and prevent diversion. We conducted qualitative analyses of semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus groups performed in 2019-20 with 61 administrative, security, behavioral health, and clinical staff who implement MOUD programming in seven Massachusetts jails. Contrary to staff expectations, buprenorphine diversion was perceived to occur infrequently during MOUD program implementation. The MOUD program changed staff views of buprenorphine, i.e., as legitimate treatment instead of as illicit contraband. Also, the program was perceived to have disrupted the illicit buprenorphine market in jail and reduced related coercion. Proactive strategies were essential to prevent and respond to buprenorphine diversion. Key components of diversion prevention strategies included: staff who distinguished among different reasons for diversion; comprehensive and routinized but flexible dosing protocols; communication, education, and monitoring; patient involvement in assessing reasons for diversion; and written policies to adjudicate diversion consequences. With appropriate protocols, buprenorphine diversion within correctional programs designed to provide MOUD treatment is perceived to be uncommon and preventable. Promising practices in program design help limit medication diversion and inform correctional officials and lawmakers as they consider whether and how to provide MOUD treatment in correctional settings.",Buprenorphine;Coercion;Communication;Community;Criminal Justice;Education;Expectations;Fear;Focus Groups;Health;Humans;Interview;Jails;Justice;Massachusetts;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Monitoring;Perception;Policy;Prescription Drug Diversion;Prisons;Program;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - Substance Abuse (AAQ-SA), a measure of psychological flexibility, among 402 adults with Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in Puerto Rico recruited from either a prison population or community treatment settings. To evaluate the factor structure of the AAQ-SA, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses with the two-factor structure proposed by the original authors and the three-factor structure found in a Mexican sample. We found the two-factor structure to be a better fit of the data from our sample. After implementing modifications to the model, the two-factor structure demonstrated adequate model fit indices. To gather evidence of convergent validity, we evaluated correlations between scores of the AAQ-SA and those of depression, self-efficacy, and self-stigma measures. The current study suggests that the AAQ-SA is a promising measure of psychological flexibility for the present target populations. Further research is needed to examine the psychometric properties of scores of the AAQ-SA, including discriminant validity.","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy;Adult;Analysis, Factor;Community;Depression;Measures;Pliability;Population;Prisons;Psychometrics;Puerto Rico;Questionnaires;Research;Self;Self Efficacy;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Target Population;Therapeutics",Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders,J Contextual Behav Sci,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35301749,2023,"""I've been to more of my friends' funerals than I've been to my friends' weddings"": Witnessing and responding to overdose in rural Northern New England.","Overdose is a leading cause of death among people who use drugs (PWUDs), but policies to reduce fatal overdose have had mixed results. Summaries of naloxone access and Good Samaritan Laws (GSLs) in prior studies provide limited information about local context. Witnessing overdoses may also be an important consideration in providing services to PWUDs, as it contributes to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which complicate substance use disorder treatment. We aim to estimate the prevalence and correlates of witnessing and responding to an overdose, while exploring overdose context among rural PWUD. The Drug Injection Surveillance and Care Enhancement for Rural Northern New England (DISCERNNE) mixed-methods study characterized substance use and risk behaviors in 11 rural Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire counties between 2018 and 2019. PWUD completed surveys (n = 589) and in-depth interviews (n = 22). Among the survey participants, 84% had ever witnessed an overdose, which was associated with probable PTSD symptoms. Overall, 51% had ever called 911 for an overdose, though some experienced criminal legal system consequences despite GSL. Although naloxone access varied, 43% had ever used naloxone to reverse an overdose. PWUD in Northern New England commonly witnessed an overdose, which they experienced as traumatic. Participants were willing to respond to overdoses, but faced barriers to effective overdose response, including limited naloxone access and criminal legal system consequences. Equipping PWUDs with effective overdose response tools (education and naloxone) and enacting policies that further protect PWUDs from criminal legal system consequences could reduce overdose mortality.","Cause of Death;Criminals;Drug Overdose;Education;Friends;Humans;Injections;Interview;Law;Massachusetts;Methods;Mortality;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;New England;New Hampshire;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Prevalence;Risk Behavior;Rural Health;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Vermont","Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders",J Rural Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35303913,2022,Navigating intersecting public health crises: a qualitative study of people with opioid use disorders' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The decades-long opioid epidemic and the more recent COVID-19 pandemic are two interacting events with significant public health impacts for people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Most published studies regarding the intersection of these two public health crises have focused on community, state, or national trends using pre-existing data. There is a need for complementary qualitative research aimed at identifying how people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are understanding, experiencing, and navigating this unprecedented time. The current study examines understandings and experiences of people with OUD while they have navigated these crises. The study was guided by a pragmatic lens. We conducted brief semi-structured qualitative interviews with 25 individuals in Chicago, the majority of which had received methadone treatment during the pandemic. Thematic inductive analysis was guided by primary interview questions. The sample represents a high-risk group, being composed mostly of older non-Hispanic African American males and having considerable socioeconomic barriers. Themes demonstrate how individuals are keeping safe despite limited knowledge of COVID-19, how the pandemic has increased treatment motivation for some, how adaptations impacted treatment and recovery supports, how the availability social support had been reduced, and difficulties individuals had keeping or obtaining financial support. The findings can be useful for informing future public health response to ensure appropriate treatment access and supports are available. In particular are the need for treatment providers to ensure people with OUD receive appropriate and understandable health crisis-related information and ensuring funds are appropriately allocated to address mental health impacts of social isolation. Finally, there is a need for appropriate financial and infrastructure supports to ensure health and treatment access disparities are not exacerbated for those in greatest need.",Address;African Americans;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Capital;Chicago;Community;Comprehension;Financial Support;Funds;Future;Health;Hispanics;Humans;Interview;Knowledge;Male;Mental Health;Methadone;Motivation;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Persons;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Risk;Social Isolation;Social Support;Therapeutics;Time,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35339585,2022,"Support for evidence-informed opioid policies and interventions: The role of racial attitudes, political affiliation, and opioid stigma.","Political affiliation, racial attitudes, and opioid stigma influence public support for public health responses to address opioid use disorders (OUD). Prior studies suggest public perceptions of the opioid epidemic are less racialized and less politically polarized than were public perceptions of the crack cocaine epidemic. Analyzing a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample (n = 1161 U.S. adults) from the October 2020 AmeriSpeak survey, we explored how political affiliation, racial attitudes (as captured in the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale [CoBRAS]), and OUD stigma were associated with respondents' expressed views regarding four critical domains. Respondents with unfavorable attitudes towards Black Americans were less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and distributing naloxone for overdose prevention. Democratic Party affiliation was associated with greater support for all three of the above measures, and increased support for mandatory treatment, which may be seen as a substitute for more punitive interventions. Black respondents were also less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and of distributing naloxone. Our finding suggest that negative attitudes towards African-Americans and political differences remain important factors of public opinion on responding to the OUD epidemic, even after controlling for opioid stigma. Our findings also suggest that culturally-competent dialogue within politically conservative and Black communities may be important to engage public support for evidence-informed treatment and prevention.","Address;Adult;African Americans;Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude;Blacks;Color;Community;Crack Cocaine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Epidemics;Government;Humans;Measures;Medicaid;Naloxone;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Perception;Persons;Policy;Public Health;Public Opinion;Racism;Respondents;Role;Scales;Substance Use;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Prev Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Yet, few correctional systems provide all FDA approved medications for OUD (MOUD) to all qualifying incarcerated individuals. We report on the implementation of MOUD in seven Massachusetts' jails following a state legislative mandate to provide access to all FDA-approved MOUD and to connect with treatment upon release. Based on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment framework, 61 clinical, corrections, and senior jail administrators participated in semi-structured interviews and focus groups between December 2019 and January 2020. Qualitative analyses focused on external and internal contexts and bridging factors. Participants detailed how the outer context (i.e., legislative mandate) drove acceptance of MOUD and assisted with continuity of care. Salient inner context factors included decision-making around administration of agonist medications, staff perceptions and training, and changes to infrastructure and daily routines. Leadership was critical in flattening standard hierarchies and advocating for flexibility. System-based characteristics of incarcerated individuals, specifically those who were pre-sentenced, presented challenges with treatment initiation. Inter- and intra-agency bridging factors reduced duplication of effort and led to quick, innovative solutions. Implementation of MOUD in jails requires collaboration with and reliance on external agencies. Preparation for implementation should involve systematic reviews of available resources and connections. Implementation requires flexibility from institutional systems that are inherently rigid. Accordingly, leaders and policymakers must recognize the cultural shift inherent in such programs and allow for resources and education to assure program success.","Administration;Administrators;Buprenorphine;Continuity of Patient Care;Decision Making;Drug Overdose;Education;Focus Groups;Humans;Implementation Science;Interview;Jails;Leadership;Massachusetts;Mortality, Premature;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Perception;Pliability;Program;Qualitative Research;Report;Resources;Risk;Solutions;Standards;Systematic Review;Therapeutics",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35438757,2022,Assessment of Community-Level Vulnerability and Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Given that COVID-19 and recent natural disasters exacerbated the shortage of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) services and were associated with increased opioid overdose mortality, it is important to examine how a community's ability to respond to natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks is associated with MOUD access. To examine the association of community vulnerability to disasters and pandemics with geographic access to each of the 3 MOUDs and whether this association differs by urban, suburban, or rural classification. This cross-sectional study of zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the continental United States excluding Washington, DC, conducted a geospatial analysis of 2020 treatment location data. Social vulnerability index (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measure of vulnerability to disasters or pandemics). Drive time in minutes from the population-weighted center of the ZCTA to the ZCTA of the nearest treatment location for each treatment type (buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone). Among 32 604 ZCTAs within the continental US, 170 within Washington, DC, and 20 without an urban-rural classification were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 32 434 ZCTAs. Greater social vulnerability was correlated with longer drive times for methadone (correlation, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.11), but it was not correlated with access to other MOUDs. Among rural ZCTAs, increasing social vulnerability was correlated with shorter drive times to buprenorphine (correlation, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.08) but vulnerability was not correlated with other measures of access. Among suburban ZCTAs, greater vulnerability was correlated with both longer drive times to methadone (correlation, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.24) and extended-release naltrexone (correlation, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.17). In this study, communities with greater vulnerability did not have greater geographic access to MOUD, and the mismatch between vulnerability and medication access was greatest in suburban communities. Rural communities had poor geographic access regardless of vulnerability status. Future disaster preparedness planning should match the location of services to communities with greater vulnerability to prevent inequities in overdose deaths.","Ability;Access To Medicines;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Classification;Community;Cross-Sectional Studies;Death;Disasters;Disease Outbreaks;District of Columbia;Drive;Future;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Index;Measures;Methadone;Mortality;Naltrexone;Natural Disasters;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Population;Rural Communities;Therapeutics;Time;United States",COVID-19;Communicable Diseases;Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

Data from online ads are often publicly available, allowing researchers to better understand the topics discussed and potential role of online ads in sexual health and risk behaviours. This study aims to examine those research questions. We collected posts on ClassifiedAds.com from the US (August 2019- February 2020). Gender identity was abstracted from post title, when available. HIV risk-related terms were abstracted from post title and content and were used to dichotomise the following variables: (1) ads describing sexual risk behaviours; (2) ads mentioning concerns over substance use or sexually transmitted infections/HIV; and (3) ads mentioning an interest in substance use. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were conducted. A total of n =12866 unique ads were posted; 72.4% posted by men. Most posts came from the southern US (34.7%) and from urban areas (89.6%). Few ads contained images (21.9%) or words associated with substance use (1%), while 26% mentioned substance use or STI/HIV concern. Logistic regression models indicated that ads in the South were less likely to contain substance use or STI/HIV concern than ads from the Midwest. Also, women were less likely than men to post about substance use or mention substance use or STI/HIV concern. Personal ads offer a glimpse into Internet-mediated sex encounters and sexual health risks among those who seek sex online. The real-time data collected has potential to highlight elevated prevalence of sexual risk behaviours that may put individuals at risk for STI/HIV or substance use.","Advertisement;Advertising;Female;Gender Identity;HIV;HIV Infections;Homosexuality, Male;Humans;Internet;Logistic Regression;Male;Men;Persons;Prevalence;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Behavior;Risk-Taking;Role;Sex;Sexual Behavior;Sexual Health;Sexual Partners;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Time;Women",HIV Infections;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Sex Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

In LT settings, MOUD was associated with higher likelihood of treatment retention and lower likelihood of treatment completion. These associations tended to be slightly weaker for CJR admissions, with the exception of treatment completion in LT settings, but the moderating effect size of CJR status in all models was very small. Small differences in the moderating effect of CJR status by race and ethnicity were observed in LT settings.

Various interrelated structural forces, together with social and economic determinants, contribute to this ongoing crisis; among these, access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and stigma towards people with OUD remain understudied. We combined data on methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone providers from SAMHSA's 2019 directory, additional naltrexone providers from Vivitrol's location finder service, with a nationally representative survey called ""The AmeriSpeak survey on stigma toward people with OUD."" Integrating the social-ecological framework, we focus on individual characteristics, personal and family members' experience with OUD, and spatial access to MOUD at the community level. We use nationally representative survey data from 3008 respondents who completed their survey in 2020. Recognizing that stigma is a multifaceted construct, we also examine how the process varies for different types of stigma, specifically perceived dangerousness and untrustworthiness, as well as social distancing measures under different scenarios. We found a significant association between stigma and spatial access to MOUD - more resources are related to weaker stigma. Respondents had a stronger stigma towards people experiencing current OUD (versus past OUD), and they were more concerned about OUD if the person would marry into their family (versus being their coworkers). Additionally, respondents' age, sex, education, and personal experience with OUD were also associated with their stigma, and the association can vary depending on the specific type of stigma. Overall, stigma towards people with OUD was associated with both personal experiences and environmental measures.","Access To Medicines;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Awareness;Buprenorphine;Community;Dangerousness;Directory;Economics;Family;Family Members;HIV;Health;Hepatitis C;Humans;Measures;Methadone;Naltrexone;Neighborhood;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Persons;Physical Distancing;Population;Resources;Respondents;Sex Education;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",Hepatitis C;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Soc Sci Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35731368,2023,Contraception and Healthcare Utilization by Reproductive-Age Women Who Use Drugs in Rural Communities: a Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Women who use drugs (WWUD) have low rates of contraceptive use and high rates of unintended pregnancy. Drug use is common among women in rural U.S. communities, with limited data on how they utilize reproductive, substance use disorder (SUD), and healthcare services. We determined contraceptive use prevalence among WWUD in rural communities then compared estimates to women from similar rural areas. We investigated characteristics of those using contraceptives, and associations between contraceptive use and SUD treatment, healthcare utilization, and substance use. Rural Opioids Initiative (ROI) - cross-sectional survey using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) involving eight rural U.S. regions (January 2018-March 2020); National Survey on Family Growth (NSFG) - nationally-representative U.S. household reproductive health survey (2017-2019). Women aged 18-49 with prior 30-day non-prescribed opioid and/or non-opioid injection drug use; fecundity determined by self-reported survey responses. Unweighted and RDS-weighted prevalence estimates of medical/procedural contraceptive use; chi-squared tests and multi-level linear regressions to test associations. Of 855 women in the ROI, 36.8% (95% CI 33.7-40.1, unweighted) and 38.6% (95% CI 30.7-47.2, weighted) reported contraceptive use, compared to 66% of rural women in the NSFG sample. Among the ROI women, 27% had received prior 30-day SUD treatment via outpatient counseling or inpatient program and these women had increased odds of contraceptive use (aOR 1.50 [95% CI 1.08-2.06]). There was a positive association between contraception use and recent medications for opioid use disorder (aOR 1.34 [95% CI 0.95-1.88]) and prior 6-month primary care utilization (aOR 1.32 [95% CI 0.96-1.82]) that did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. WWUD in rural areas reported low contraceptive use; those who recently received SUD treatment had greater odds of contraceptive use. Improvements are needed in expanding reproductive and preventive health within SUD treatment and primary care services in rural communities.","Aged;Association;Community;Contraception;Contraceptive Agents;Counseling;Cross-Sectional Studies;Family;Fertility;Growth;Health Care;Households;Injections;Inpatients;Linear Regression;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnancy, Unplanned;Prevalence;Preventive Health Services;Primary Health Care;Program;Reproductive Health;Respondents;Rural Communities;Rural Health Services;Self;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Women;Women's Health",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35751945,2022,Using structured implementation interventions to improve referral to substance use treatment among justice-involved youth: Findings from a multisite cluster randomized trial.,"Youth involved in the justice system have high rates of alcohol and other drug use, but limited treatment engagement. JJ-TRIALS tested implementation activities with community supervision (CS) and behavioral health (BH) agencies to improve screening, identification of substance use service need, referral, and treatment initiation and engagement, guided by the BH Services Cascade and EPIS frameworks. This paper summarizes intervention impacts on referrals to treatment among youth on CS. This multisite cluster-randomized trial involved 18 matched pairs of sites in 36 counties in seven states randomly assigned to core or enhanced conditions after implementing the core intervention at all sites for six months. Enhanced sites received external facilitation for local change team activities to reduce unmet treatment needs; Core sites were encouraged to form interagency workgroups. The dependent variable was percentage referred to treatment among youth in need (N = 14,012). Two-level Bayesian regression assessed factors predicting referral across all sites and time periods. Generalized linear mixed models using logit transformation tested two hypotheses: (H1) referrals will increase from baseline to the experimental period, (H2) referral increases will be larger in enhanced sites than in core sites. Although the intervention significantly increased referral, condition did not significantly predict referral across all time periods. Youth who tested drug positive, had an alcohol/other drug-related or felony charge, were placed in secure detention or assigned more intensive supervision, or who were White were more likely to be referred. H1 (p &lt; .05) and H2 (p &lt; .0001) were both significant in the hypothesized direction. Interaction analyses comparing site pair differences showed that findings were not consistent across sites. The percentage of youth referred to treatment increased compared with baseline overall, and enhanced sites showed larger increases in referrals over time. However, variations in effects suggest that site-level differences were important. Researchers should carry out mixed methods studies to further understand reasons for the inconsistent findings within randomized site pairs, and how to further improve treatment referrals across CS and BH systems. Findings also highlight that even when CS agencies work collaboratively with BH providers to improve referrals, most justice-involved youth who need SU services are not referred.",Adolescent;Alcohols;Bayes Theorem;Case Management;Charges;Community;Form;Health;Humans;Implementation Science;Justice;Mass Screening;Methods;Needs;Overall;Paper;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Research Personnel;Screening;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Supervision;Therapeutics;Time;Whites;Work;Youth,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35865008,2021,Application of Distributed Agent-based Modeling to Investigate Opioid Use Outcomes in Justice Involved Populations.,"Criminal justice involved (CJI) individuals with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) are at high risk of overdose and death in the weeks following release from jail. We developed the Justice-Community Circulation Model (JCCM) to investigate OUD/CJI dynamics post-release and the effects of interventions on overdose deaths. The JCCM uses a synthetic agent-based model population of approximately 150,000 unique individuals that is generated using demographic information collected from multiple Chicago-area studies and data sets. We use a high-performance computing (HPC) workflow to implement a sequential approximate Bayesian computation algorithm for calibrating the JCCM. The calibration results in the simulated joint posterior distribution of the JCCM input parameters. The calibrated model is used to investigate the effects of a naloxone intervention for a mass jail release. The simulation results show the degree to which a targeted intervention focusing on recently released jail inmates can help reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose.",Agent-Based Modeling;Algorithms;Calibration;Chicago;Community;Criminal Justice;Dataset;Death;Demography;High Performance Computing;History;Jails;Joints;Justice;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Population;Risk;Workflow,Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,IEEE Int Symp Parallel Distrib Process Workshops Phd Forum,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35922684,2022,Impacts of COVID-19 at the intersection of substance use disorder treatment and criminal justice systems: findings from three states.,"Individuals with substance use disorders (SUD), particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), who are criminal justice-involved are a particularly vulnerable population that has been adversely affected by COVID-19 due to impacts of the pandemic on both the criminal justice and treatment systems. The manuscript presents qualitative data and findings exploring issues related to SUD/OUD treatment among individuals involved in the justice system and the impacts of COVID-19 on these service systems. Qualitative data were collected separately by teams from three different research hubs/sites in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky; at each hub, data were collected from justice system personnel (n = 17) and community-level SUD/OUD providers (n = 21). Codes from two hubs were reviewed and merged to develop the cross-hub coding list. The combined codes were used deductively to analyze the third hub's data, and higher-level themes were then developed across all the hubs' data. Themes reflected the justice and treatment systems' responses to COVID-19, the intersection of systems and COVID-19's impact on providing OUD treatment for such individuals, and the use of telehealth and telejustice. Results highlight that despite rapid adaptations made by systems during the pandemic, additional work is needed to better support individuals with OUD who are involved in the justice system. Such work can inform longer-term public health crisis planning to improve community OUD treatment access and linkage for those who are criminal justice-involved.",COVID-19;Coding;Community;Criminal Justice;Illinois;Indiana;Justice;Kentucky;Manuscript;Occupational Groups;Opioid Use Disorder;Pandemics;Public Health;Research;Substance Use Disorders;Telehealth;Therapeutics;Vulnerable Populations;Work,COVID-19;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35939914,2022,Use of long-acting injectable buprenorphine in the correctional setting.,"As overdoses due to opioids rise, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) continue to be underemployed, resulting in limited access to potentially life-saving treatment. Substance use disorders are prevalent in individuals who are incarcerated, and these individuals are at increased risk for death postrelease due to overdose. Few jails and prisons offer MOUD and most limit access. Extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP), a novel monthly injectable MOUD formulation, could be uniquely poised to address treatment access in correctional settings. This study linked a retrospective cohort design of statewide datasets to evaluate the real-world use of XR-BUP. The study included individuals (N = 54) who received XR-BUP while incarcerated from January 2019 through February 2022. The study was conducted at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, with the nation's first comprehensive statewide correctional MOUD program. Fifty-four individuals received a combined total of 162 injections during the study period. The study found no evidence of tampering with the injection site, indicating no attempts by participants to remove, hoard, or divert the medication. Sixty-one percent reported at least one adverse effect after injections were received, with an average of 2.8 side effects. Sixty-one percent of those released on XR-BUP engaged in MOUD after release, 30 % continued with XR-BUP. XR-BUP is feasible and acceptable in correctional settings. XR-BUP addresses administrative concerns of diversion that obstruct lifesaving MOUD and offers another safe and effective treatment option. Further studies and trials should continue to assess this novel medication's ability to treat opioid addiction in the correctional setting and upon release to the community.",Ability;Address;Buprenorphine;Community;Correctional Facilities;Dataset;Death;Delayed-Action Preparations;Humans;Injectables;Injections;Jails;Life;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Prisons;Program;Retrospective Studies;Rhode Island;Risk;Savings;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics,Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35965159,2022,Medication for opioid use disorder treatment continuity post-release from jail: A qualitative study with community-based treatment providers.,"People released from jail are at elevated opioid overdose risk. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are effective in reducing overdoses. MOUD treatment was recently mandated in seven Massachusetts jails, but little is known about barriers and facilitators to treatment continuity post-release. We aimed to assess MOUD provider perspectives on treatment continuity among people released from jail. We conducted qualitative interviews with 36 medical, supervisory, and administrative staff at MOUD programs that serve jail-referred patients. We used the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) implementation science framework to guide development of instruments, codes, and analyses. We employed deductive and inductive coding, and a grounded theory analytical approach to identify salient themes. Inner context findings highlighted necessary adjustments among jail staff to approve MOUD treatment, especially with agonist medications that were previously considered contraband. Participants perceived that some staff within jails favored abstinence-based recovery, viewing agonists as a crutch. Bridging results highlighted the importance of inter-agency communication and coordination to ensure information transfer for seamless treatment continuity in the community post-release. Pre-release planning, release on pre-scheduled dates, medication provision to cover gaps between jail release and intake at community MOUD sites, and exchange of treatment information across agencies were viewed as paramount to success. Unexpected early releases and releases from court were viewed as barriers to treatment coordination. Outer context domains were largely tied to social determinants of health. Substantial barriers to treatment continuity included shelter, food security, employment, transportation, and insurance reactivation. Through qualitative interviews with community-based MOUD staff, we identified salient barriers and facilitators to treatment continuity post-release from jails. Findings point to needed investments in care coordination, staffing, and funding to strengthen jail-to-community-based MOUD treatment, removing barriers to continuity, and decreasing opioid overdose deaths during this high-risk transition.",Adjustment;Buprenorphine;Coding;Communication;Community;Crutches;Dates;Death;Drug Overdose;Employment;Food Security;Grounded Theory;Humans;Implementation Science;Insurance;Interview;Investments;Jails;Massachusetts;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Program;Qualitative Research;Risk;Social Determinants of Health;Therapeutics;Transportation;Workforce,Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The current study's specific aim is to assess the psychometric properties (factor structure and reliability) of the translated and culturally adapted SASSS instrument in a cross-sectional study of individuals (n = 412) with SUDs with or without HIV from correctional facilities and community treatment programs. A confirmatory factor analysis evidenced the four-factor structure of SASSS. Results showed significant correlations with HIV felt stigma among those participants with co-occurring SUD and HIV (n=119), internalized shame, stigma-related interpersonal rejection due to substance abuse, symptoms of depression, substance use within the last 30 days, psychological flexibility, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, supporting good convergent validity. The measure showed a strong factor structure and adequate reliability estimates supporting its applicability to Latinos with SUDs from community and criminal justice settings. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for studies of stigma impact and intervention.","Analysis, Factor;Community;Correctional Facilities;Criminal Justice;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression;HIV;Latinos;Measures;Pliability;Program;Psychometrics;Scales;Screening;Self;Self Efficacy;Self Esteem;Shame;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics",Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Stigma Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
35994938,2022,Jail-based reentry programming to support continued treatment with medications for opioid use disorder: Qualitative perspectives and experiences among jail staff in Massachusetts.,"Individuals with opioid use disorder released to communities after incarceration experience an elevated risk for overdose death. Massachusetts is the first state to mandate county jails to deliver all FDA approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The present study considered perspectives around coordination of post-release care among jail staff engaged in MOUD programs focused on coordination of care to the community. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 61 jail staff involved in implementation of MOUD programs. Interview guide development, and coding and analysis of qualitative data were guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Deductive and inductive approaches were used for coding and themes were organized using the EPIS. Salient themes in the inner context focused on the elements of reentry planning that influence coordination of post-release care including timing of initiation, staff knowledge about availability of MOUD in community settings, and internal collaborations. Findings on bridging factors highlighted the importance of interagency communication to follow pre-scheduled release dates and use of bridge scripts to minimize the gap in treatment during the transition. Use of navigators was an additional factor that influenced MOUD initiation and engagement in community settings. Outer context findings indicated partnerships with community providers and timely reinstatement of health insurance coverage as critical factors that influence coordination of post-release care. Coordination of MOUD post-release continuity of care requires training supporting staff in reentry planning as well as resources to enhance internal collaborations and bridging partnerships between in-jail MOUD programs and community MOUD providers. In addition, efforts to reduce systemic barriers related to unanticipated timing of release and reinstatement of health insurance coverage are needed to optimize seamless post-release care.","Buprenorphine;Coding;Communication;Community;Continuity of Patient Care;Dates;Death;Drug Overdose;Elements;Focus Groups;Humans;Insurance, Health;Interview;Jails;Knowledge;Massachusetts;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Program;Resources;Risk;Therapeutics",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36128341,2022,Providing peer navigation services to women with a history of opioid misuse pre- and post-release from jail: A program description.,"Justice system-involved women with opioid use disorder (OUD) experience layered health risks and stigma, yet peer navigation services during reentry may support positive outcomes. This manuscript offers a program description of a women's peer navigation intervention delivered pre- and post-release from jail to remove barriers to women's access to OUD treatment, including medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). All data were collected as part of a NIH/NIDA-funded national cooperative, the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) project. Through the larger study's intervention, women in jail with OUD are connected via videoconference to a peer navigator, who provides an initial reentry recovery assessment and 12+ weeks of recovery support sessions post-release. Qualitative analyses examined peers' notes from initial sessions with women (N = 50) and in-depth interviews with peers (N = 3). Peers' notes from initial sessions suggest that women anticipate challenges to successful recovery and community reentry. More than half of women (51.9%) chose OUD treatment as their primary goal, while others selected more basic needs (e.g. housing, transportation). In qualitative interviews, peers described women's transitions to the community as unpredictable, creating difficulties for reentry planning, particularly for rural women. Peers also described challenges with stigma against MOUD and establishing relationships via telehealth, but ultimately believed their role was valuable in providing resource referrals, support, and hope for recovery. For women with OUD, peer navigation can offer critical linkages to services at release from jail, in addition to hope, encouragement, and solidarity. Findings provide important insights for future peer-based interventions.",Community;Criminal Justice;Future;Goals;Health;History;Hope;Housing;Interview;Jails;Justice;Manuscript;Needs;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Program Descriptions;Referral;Resources;Risk;Role;Telehealth;Therapeutics;Transportation;Videoconference;Women,Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder,J Clin Transl Sci,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36482490,2022,Providing substance use disorder treatment in correctional settings: knowledge gaps and proposed research priorities-overview and commentary.,"This manuscript is the product of the authors' discussions, literature overview, and consultation with experts in the field, and identifies important gaps in the evidence base for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment effectiveness within criminal justice (CJ) settings. Lacking from the extant literature are longitudinal investigations of treatment related outcomes during and after incarceration. Such studies could provide rich contextual data about treatment delivery and effectiveness across the CJ continuum, and would provide important insight into individual characteristics (e.g., motivation, treatment modality preferences, treatment completion rates, etc.) as well as institutional and environmental factors (e.g., appropriate staffing, space limitations for individual treatment sessions, distribution of medications, etc.). We also identified the importance of reproducibility within CJ research, and the unfortunate reality of too many single studies conducted in single (or relatively few) correctional facilities. Some of this has been because the studies designed to produce that evidence are not prioritized for funding, which has continually placed researchers in a position where we cannot make firm conclusions or recommendations based on available evidence. The importance of replicating the foundational studies in this field cannot be overstated. We hope this article spurs other researchers to join in the healthy process of questioning the existing state of the CJ-based SUD treatment research, what should be re-examined, and how we can lay a stronger foundation for the future.",Clinical Effectiveness;Comment;Consultation;Correctional Facilities;Criminal Justice;Foundations;Future;Health Status;Hope;Humans;Knowledge;Literature;Manuscript;Motivation;Reproducibility of Results;Research;Research Personnel;Research Priorities;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Workforce,Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36527067,2022,The comparative effectiveness of Core versus Core+Enhanced implementation strategies in a randomized controlled trial to improve substance use treatment receipt among justice-involved youth.,"Most justice-involved youth are supervised in community settings, where assessment and linkage to substance use (SU) treatment services are inconsistent and fragmented. Only 1/3 of youth with an identified SU need receive a treatment referral and even fewer initiate services. Thus, improving identification and linkage to treatment requires coordination across juvenile justice (JJ) and behavioral health (BH) agencies. The current study examines the comparative effectiveness of two bundled implementation intervention strategies for improving SU treatment initiation, engagement, and continuing care among justice-involved youth supervised in community settings. Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) served as the conceptual framework for study design and selection/timing of implementation intervention components, and the BH Services Cascade served as the conceptual and measurement framework for identifying and addressing gaps in service receipt. Part of a larger Juvenile-Justice Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS) Cooperative, this study involved a multisite, cluster-randomized control trial where sites were paired then randomly assigned to receive Core (training teams on the BH Services Cascade and data-driven decision making; supporting goal selection) or Core+Enhanced (external facilitation of implementation teams) intervention components. Youth service records were collected from 20 JJ community supervision agencies (in five states) across five study phases (baseline, pre-randomization, early experiment, late experiment, maintenance). Implementation teams comprised of JJ and BH staff collaboratively identified goals along the BH Cascade and used data-driven decision-making to implement change. Results suggest that Core intervention components were effective at increasing service receipt over time relative to baseline, but differences between Core and Core+Enhanced conditions were non-significant. Time to service initiation was shorter among Core+Enhanced sites, and deeper Cascade penetration occurred when external facilitation (of implementation teams) was provided. Wide variation existed in the degree and nature of change across service systems. Findings demonstrate the criticality of early EPIS phases, demonstrating that strategies provided during the formative exploration and preparation phases produced some improvement in service receipt, whereas implementation-focused activities produced incremental improvement in moving youth farther along the Cascade.",Adolescent;Community;Decision Making;Goals;Health;Humans;Justice;Maintenance;Nature;Needs;Random Allocation;Randomized Controlled Trial;Records;Referral;Relatives;Research Design;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Supervision;Therapeutics;Time;Translational Research;Youth,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,BMC Health Serv Res,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,
36538121,2022,Availability of best practices for opioid use disorder in jails and related training and resource needs: findings from a national interview study of jails in heavily impacted counties in the U.S.,"Jails are optimal settings in which to screen individuals for opioid use disorders (OUD) and provide needed services, especially medications for OUD (MOUD). This study sought to assess the availability of OUD ""best practices"" in jails located in counties heavily impacted by opioid overdose in the U.S. and their related training and resource needs. Counties were selected for study inclusion using two indicators of OUD severity: the absolute number and population rate of opioid overdose deaths. Structured interviews were completed with representatives from 185/244 (76%) of targeted counties and 185/250 (74%) of targeted jails in these counties. Ten OUD best practices were identified based on current treatment and practice guidelines. These include: screening for OUD; clinical assessment; medically managed withdrawal; MOUD administration; MOUD for pregnant people; counseling and wrap-around services; collaboration with community providers; assistance with Medicaid/insurance; re-entry services; and overdose prevention. Descriptive analyses examined the provision of any services and average percentage of services endorsed within best-practice categories, association of best-practice availability with community and jail characteristics, and related needs for training and resources. Over 70% of jail respondents indicated that some aspects of each of the ten OUD best practices were available within their jails, ranging from 71% using clinical assessment to 96% providing overdose prevention. However, there was considerable variability in the average percentage of items endorsed within each best-practice category, ranging from 38% of items regarding re-entry services to 88% of items regarding medically managed withdrawal. Availability of OUD best practices in jails also varied by community and jail characteristics. Jails reported the highest needs for funding for medication and clinical staff. Policies are needed to address the identified gaps in availability of OUD best practices within jails. Training, technical assistance, and funding are needed to improve clinical capacity of jails to administer MOUD and to ensure continuity of care from jail to community, which are essential to reducing the risk of opioid-related overdose following release.",Address;Administration;Association;Best Practices;Community;Continuity of Patient Care;Counseling;Death;Indicators;Insurance;Interview;Jails;Medicaid;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Policy;Population;Practice Guideline;Resources;Respondents;Risk;Screening;Therapeutics,Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

The Rural Opioid Initiative (January 2018-March 2020) was a cross-sectional study of people with prior 30-day injection drug or nonprescribed opioid use from rural areas of 10 states. Using multivariable mixed-effect regression models, we examined associations between participant technology access and SUD treatment. Of 3,026 participants, 71% used heroin and 76% used methamphetamine. Thirty-five percent had no cell phone and 10% had no prior 30-day internet use. Having both a cell phone and the internet was associated with increased days of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) use (aIRR 1.29 [95% CI 1.11-1.52]) and a higher likelihood of SUD counseling in the prior 30 days (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.05-1.57]). Lack of cell phone was associated with decreased days of MOUD (aIRR 0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.91]) and a lower likelihood of prior 30-day SUD counseling (aOR 0.77 [95% CI 0.62-0.94]).

30867068,2019,Provider and patient perspectives on barriers to buprenorphine adherence and the acceptability of video directly observed therapy to enhance adherence.,"Buprenorphine effectively reduces opioid craving and illicit opioid use. However, some patients may not take their medication as prescribed and thus experience suboptimal outcomes. The study aim was to qualitatively explore buprenorphine adherence and the acceptability of utilizing video directly observed therapy (VDOT) among patients and their providers in an office-based program. Clinical providers (physicians and staff; n = 9) as well as patients (n = 11) were recruited from an office-based opioid treatment program at an urban academic medical center in the northwestern United States. Using a semi-structured guide, interviewers conducted individual interviews and focus group discussions. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were independently coded to identify key themes related to non-adherence and then jointly reviewed in an iterative fashion to develop a set of content codes. Among providers and patients, perceived reasons for buprenorphine non-adherence generally fell into several thematic categories: social and structural factors that prevented patients from consistently accessing medications or taking them reliably (e.g., homelessness, transportation difficulties, chaotic lifestyles, and mental illness); refraining from taking medication in order to use illicit drugs or divert; and forgetting to take medication, especially in the setting of taking split-doses. Some participants perceived non-adherence to be less of a problem for buprenorphine than for other medications. VDOT was viewed as potentially enhancing patient accountability, leading to more trust from providers who are concerned about diversion. On the other hand, some participants expressed concern that VDOT would place undue burden on patients, which could have the opposite effect of eroding patient-provider trust. Others questioned the clinical indication. Findings suggest potential arenas for enhancing buprenorphine adherence, although structural barriers will likely be most challenging to ameliorate. Providers as well as patients indicated mixed attitudes toward VDOT, suggesting it would need to be thoughtfully implemented.","Academic Medical Centers;Accountability;Adult;Attitude;Attitude of Health Personnel;Buprenorphine;Craving;Directly Observed Therapy;Female;Focus Groups;Hand;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Homelessness;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Interview;Interviewers;Interviews as Topic;Life Style;Male;Medication Adherence;Mental Disorders;Middle Aged;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Northwestern United States;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Physicians;Program;Qualitative Research;Socioeconomic Factors;Technology, Health Care;Therapeutics;Transportation;Trust;United States",Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31049808,2020,Computer-Based Substance Use Reporting and Acceptance of HIV Testing Among Emergency Department Patients.,"More than 10 years after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine HIV testing for patients in emergency departments (ED) and other clinical settings, as many as three out of four patients may not be offered testing, and those who are offered testing frequently decline. The current study examines how participant characteristics, including demographics and reported substance use, influence the efficacy of a video-based intervention designed to increase HIV testing among ED patients who initially declined tests offered by hospital staff. Data from three separate trials in a high volume New York City ED were merged to determine whether patients (N = 560) were more likely to test post-intervention if: (1) they resembled people who appeared onscreen in terms of gender or race; or (2) they reported problem substance use. Chi Square and logistic regression analyses indicated demographic concordance did not significantly increase likelihood of accepting an HIV test. However, participants who reported problem substance use (n = 231) were significantly more likely to test for HIV in comparison to participants who reported either no problem substance use (n = 190) or no substance use at all (n = 125) (x2 = 6.830, p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, 36.4% of patients who reported problem substance use tested for HIV post-intervention compared to 30.5% of patients who did not report problem substance use and 28.8% of participants who did not report substance use at all. This may be an important finding because substance use, including heavy alcohol or cannabis use, can lead to behaviors that increase HIV risk, such as sex with multiple partners or decreased condom use.","AIDS Serodiagnosis;Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Behavior;Cannabis;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Computers;Condoms;Demography;Diagnostic Tests, Routine;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Gender;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV Testing;Hospitals;Humans;Lead;Logistic Regression;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;New York;New York City;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient Compliance;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Racial Stocks;Report;Risk;Serologic Tests;Sex;Sexual Partners;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Technology;United States;Video Recording",Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,AIDS Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31972762,2020,Acceptability and Feasibility of a Mobile Health Application for Video Directly Observed Therapy of Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorders in an Office-based Setting.,"Video directly observed therapy (video-DOT) through a mobile health platform may improve buprenorphine adherence and decrease diversion. This pilot study tested the acceptability and feasibility of using this technology among patients receiving buprenorphine in an office-based setting. Participants were instructed to record videos of themselves taking buprenorphine. Data were collected from weekly in-person visits over a 4-week period; assessments included self-report of medication adherence, substance use, satisfaction with treatment and use of the application, and also urine drug testing. Open-ended questions at the final visit solicited feedback on patients' experiences using the mobile health application. The sample consisted of 14 patients; a majority were male (86%) and White (79%). All participants except 1 (93%) were able to use the application successfully to upload videos. Among those who successfully used the application, the percentage of daily videos uploaded per participant ranged from 18% to 96%; on average, daily videos were submitted by participants 72% of the time. Most participants (10/14; 71%) reported being ""very satisfied"" with the application; of the remaining 4 participants, 2 were ""satisfied"" and 2 were ""neutral."" Participants reported liking the accountability and structure of the application provided and its ease of use. Negative feedback included minor discomfort at viewing one's self during recording and the time required. Based on these results, use of a mobile health application for video-DOT of buprenorphine appears feasible and acceptable for patients who are treated in an office-based setting. Further research is needed to test whether use of such an application can improve treatment delivery and health outcomes.",Accountability;Buprenorphine;Directly Observed Therapy;Feasibility Studies;Feedback;Female;Health;Humans;Male;Medication Adherence;Minors;Mobile Health;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Records;Research;Satisfaction;Self;Self Report;Substance Use;Technology;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Time;Urine;Whites,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32149192,2020,Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool.,"The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or ""trolling""); and lack common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the ""Marigold App"", for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform. The Marigold mobile platform will allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically ""flagging"" critical or clinically relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific ""flags"" in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.",Adult;Artificial Intelligence;Benchmarks;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Complement System Proteins;Comprehension;Flags;Form;Health;Interview;Machine Learning;Methods;Natural Language Processing;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Outpatients;Patients;Pilots;Program;Relapse;Self Efficacy;Self-Help Groups;Smartphone;Substance Use;Technology;Text Messages;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Relapse;Substance Use,J Psychiatr Brain Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32736660,2020,Video directly observed therapy intervention using a mobile health application among opioid use disorder patients receiving office-based buprenorphine treatment: protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Office-based buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) does not typically include in-person directly observed therapy (DOT), potentially leading to non-adherence. Video DOT technologies may safeguard against this issue and thus enhance likelihood of treatment success. We describe the rationale and protocol for the Trial of Adherence Application for Buprenorphine treatment (TAAB) study, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of video DOT delivered via a smartphone app on office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes, namely illicit opioid use and retention. Participants will be recruited from office-based opioid addiction treatment programs in outpatient clinics at two urban medical centers and randomized to either video DOT (intervention) delivered via a HIPAA-compliant, asynchronous, mobile health (mHealth) technology platform, or treatment-as-usual (control). Eligibility criteria are: 18 years or older, prescribed sublingual buprenorphine for a cumulative total of 28 days or less from the office-based opioid treatment program, and able to read and understand English. Patients will be considered ineligible if they are unable or unwilling to use the intervention, provide consent, or complete weekly study visits. All participants will complete 13 in-person weekly visits and be followed via electronic health record data capture at 12- and 24-weeks post-randomization. Data gathered include the following: demographics; current and previous treatment for OUD; self-reported diversion of prescribed buprenorphine; status of their mental and physical health; and self-reported lifetime and past 30-day illicit substance use. Participants provide urine samples at each weekly visit to test for illicit drugs and buprenorphine. The primary outcome is percentage of weekly urines that are negative for opioids over the 12-weeks. The secondary outcome is engagement in treatment at week 12. Video DOT delivered through mHealth technology platform offers possibility of improving patients' buprenorphine adherence by providing additional structure and accountability. The TAAB study will provide important preliminary estimates of the impact of this mHealth technology for patients initiating buprenorphine, as well as the feasibility of study procedures, thus paving the way for further research to assess feasibility and generate preliminary data for design of a future Phase III trial.

32973577,2020,A Novel Treatment of Opioid Cravings With an Effect Size of .73 for Unilateral Transcranial Photobiomodulation Over Sham.,"Opioid use disorders (OUDs) are an epidemic causing catastrophic consequences to individuals, families, and society despite treatments including psychotherapy, substitution therapy or receptor blockers, and psychoeducation. We have developed a novel treatment that combines unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) to the hemisphere with a more positive valence by Dual Brain Psychology (DBP). We used a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 22 patients with significant opioid cravings and a history of recent or current OUD attended three 1-h weekly sessions. After baseline measures of opioid craving and other psychometrics, subjects received two unilateral t-PBM applications (810 nm CW LED, 250 mW/cm2, 60 J/cm2, 4 min) or a sham (foil-covered LED) at F3 or F4. Prior to any treatment we used two tests to determine which hemisphere was more associated with a negative outlook and cravings and treated that side before the more positive hemisphere. Primary outcome measure was an opioid craving scale (OCS). Secondary outcomes were weekly Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HARS) Rating Scales prior to treatments and at follow-up. Immediately after treatment the OCS improved significantly for both the sham and active treatments, but one week later the active treatment showed a 51.0% (SD 33.7) decrease in OCS while a week after the sham treatments there was a decrease of only 15.8% (SD 35.0) (by Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test, p = 0.004) and by a mixed model it was p = 0.0071. The effect size for the differences between active and sham was 0.73. For the active treatment from before and after treatment the effect size was 1.51 and for the sham, 0.45. The HDRS improved from a baseline of 15.1 to 8.8 (SD 10.3) a week after the active treatment and to 13.3 (SD 12.9) after the sham (p = 0.0071). HARS improved from 14.7 to 8.0 (SD 13.2) after the active treatments and to 14.3 (SD 16.0) after the sham, p = 0.08. Active treatment of the positive hemisphere after the negative hemisphere significantly improved the OCS, but there was no significant difference after the sham treatment. One patient complained of 2 h of abdominal bloating and dropped out; no other adverse effects were observed. Unilateral t-PBM to the hemisphere with a more positive hemispheric emotional valence was an effective and safe treatment for opioid cravings as well as for depression and anxiety.

33303253,2021,Leveraging digital tools to support recovery from substance use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic response.,"Treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) during the COVID-19 pandemic poses unique challenges, both due to direct effects from the illness, and indirect effects from the physical measures needed to ""flatten the curve."" Stress, isolation, lack of structure, limited access to physical and mental health care, and changes in treatment paradigms all increase risk of return to drug use events and pose barriers to recovery for people with SUDs. The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment.

There are few good treatments. This paper presents a novel, easily applied, painless, therapy that can be applied as an adjunct to psychotherapies and medications. The author presents a retrospective overview and 4 brief case reports. Two are typical of very positively responsive patients, one is of a positively but not remarkably responsive patient, and one of a non-responsive patient. The author used unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation (UtPBM), near infrared mode, applied to the hemisphere with the more positive hemispheric emotional valence (HEV) as a treatment to augment the patients' usual treatment. The case reports are from 42 consecutive patients in his practice with OUD where he has given 382 treatments over 18 months, as needed. The author's subjective clinical observations were that of the 42 patients, 26 (62%) consistently had responses to the UtPBM (as described in the case reports) that were easily observable to the patient and the author as strikingly beneficial, 8 (19%) had helpful, but not remarkable responses, and 8 (19%) had no noticeable response. These 3 characterizations will be illustrated with clinical examples. There were no side-effects reported or observed aside from 2 women who experienced anxiety which resolved with psychotherapy. Using UtPBM as an adjunctive treatment to the author's usual in-depth psychotherapy and medication management, he found subjectively that for the majority of his patients, this treatment was a valuable, safe benefit to their treatment for OUD.",Anxiety;Case Reports;Depression;Drug Dependence;Family;Female;Humans;Light;Male;Observation;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Paper;Patients;Psychological Trauma;Psychotherapy;Retrospective Studies;Societies;Therapeutics;Women,Drug Dependence;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Psychological Trauma,J Psychiatr Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

There are a variety of wireless technologies under investigation for the treatment of substance use disorder. Wearable sensors are the most commonly used technology. They can be used to decrease heavy substance use, mitigate factors related to relapse, and monitor for overdose. New technologies pose distinct advantages over traditional therapies by increasing geographic availability and continuously providing feedback and monitoring while remaining relatively non-invasive. Wearable and novel technologies are important to the evolving landscape of substance use treatment.

33748430,2021,"Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE): A Digital Tool to Support Recovery from Substance Use Disorder.","Substance use disorders are a highly prevalent group of chronic diseases with devastating individual and public health consequences. Current treatment strategies suffer from high rates of relapse, or return to drug use, and novel solutions are desperately needed. Realize Analyze Engage (RAE) is a digital, mHealth intervention that focusses on real time, objective detection of high-risk events (stress and drug craving) to deploy just-in-time supportive interventions. The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes. The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life. The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most. RAE also aims to provide clinicians with actionable insight to understand patients' level of risk, and contextual clues for their triggers in order to provide more personalized recovery support.",Algorithms;Chronic Disease;Craving;Focus Groups;Health;Interview;Mobile Health;Outpatients;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trial;Relapse;Risk;Solutions;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time,Chronic Disease;Relapse;Substance Use Disorders,J Psychiatr Brain Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33762918,2021,Transcutaneous Auricular Neurostimulation (tAN): A Novel Adjuvant Treatment in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome.,"Maternal opioid use during pregnancy is a growing national problem and can lead to newborns developing neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) soon after birth. Recent data demonstrates that nearly every 15 min a baby is born in the United States suffering from NOWS. The primary treatment for NOWS is opioid replacement therapy, commonly oral morphine, which has neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. There is an urgent need for non-opioid treatments for NOWS. Transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation (tAN), a novel and non-invasive form of electrostimulation, may serve as a promising alternative to morphine. tAN is delivered via a multichannel earpiece electrode worn on and around the left ear, targeting two cranial nerves-the vagus and trigeminal nerves. Prior research suggests that auricular neurostimulation exerts an anxiolytic effect on the body by releasing endogenous opioids and reduces withdrawal symptoms in adults actively withdrawing from opioids. In this first-in-human prospective, open-label trial, we investigated tAN as an adjuvant to morphine therapy in eight infants &gt;33 weeks gestational age suffering from NOWS and receiving oral morphine treatment. Infants received tAN for 30 min 1 h before receiving a morphine dose. tAN was delivered at 0.1 mA below perception intensity at two different nerve targets on the ear: Region 1, the auricular branch of the vagus nerve; and Region 2, the auriculotemporal nerve. tAN was delivered up to four times daily for a maximum of 12 days. The primary outcome measures were safety [heart rate monitoring, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), and skin irritation] and morphine length of treatment (LOT). tAN was well-tolerated and resulted in no unanticipated adverse events. Comparing to the national average of 23 days, the average oral morphine LOT was 13.3 days (median 9 days) and the average LOT after tAN initiation was 7 days (median 6 days). These preliminary data suggest that tAN is safe and may serve as a promising alternative adjuvant for treating NOWS and reducing the amount of time an infant receives oral morphine.","Adult;Anti-Anxiety Effect;Auriculotemporal Nerve;Brain;Cranial Nerves;Ear;Electrodes;Form;Gestational Age;Heart Rate;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Lead;Medicine;Morphine;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Pain;Parturition;Perception;Pregnancy;Preliminary Data;Research;Safety;Scales;Skin;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;Trigeminal Nerve;United States;Vagus Nerve;Withdrawal Symptoms",Pain;Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,Front Hum Neurosci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33828497,2021,Alcohol Use Disorder in the Age of Technology: A Review of Wearable Biosensors in Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment.,"Biosensors enable observation and understanding of latent physiological occurrences otherwise unknown or invasively detected. Wearable biosensors monitoring physiological constructs across a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions have become an important trend in innovative research methodologies. Within substance use research, explorations of biosensor technology commonly focus on identifying physiological indicators of intoxication to increase understanding of addiction etiology and to inform treatment recommendations. In this review, we examine the state of research in this area as it pertains to treatment of alcohol use disorders specifically highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge with recommendations for future research. Annually, alcohol use disorders affect approximately 15 million individuals. A primary focus of existing wearable technology-based research among people with alcohol use disorders is identifying alcohol intoxication. A large benefit of wearable biosensors for this purpose is they provide continuous readings in a passive manner compared with the gold standard measure of blood alcohol content (BAC) traditionally measured intermittently by breathalyzer or blood draw. There are two primary means of measuring intoxication with biosensors: gait and sweat. Gait changes have been measured via smart sensors placed on the wrist, in the shoe, and mobile device sensors in smart phones. Sweat measured by transdermal biosensors detects the presence of alcohol in the blood stream correlating to BAC. Transdermal biosensors have been designed in tattoos/skin patches, shirts, and most commonly, devices worn on the ankle or wrist. Transdermal devices were initially developed to help monitor court-ordered sobriety among offenders with alcohol use disorder. These devices now prove most useful in continuously tracking consumption throughout clinical trials for behavioral treatment modalities. More recent research has started exploring the uses for physical activity trackers and physiological arousal sensors to guide behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. While research has begun to demonstrate wearable devices' utility in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals aiming to cutdown on their drinking, monitoring sustained abstinence in studies exploring contingency management for alcohol use disorders, and facilitating engagement in activity-based treatment interventions, their full potential to further aid in understanding of, and treatment for, alcohol use disorders has yet to be explored.","Affect;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohols;Ankle;Arousal;Biosensors;Blood;Blood Alcohol Content;Clinical Trial;Comprehension;Consumption;Devices;Drinking;Exercise;Future;Gait;Gold;Health;Indicators;Knowledge;Measures;Mobile Devices;Monitoring, Physiologic;Observation;Offenders;Persons;Reading;Relapse Prevention;Research;Research Methodology;Review;Shoes;Skin;Smartphone;Standards;Streams;Substance Use;Sweat;Tattoo;Technology;Therapeutics;Wearable Electronic Devices;Wrist",Alcohol Use Disorder;Relapse;Substance Use,Front Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34399136,2021,Video directly observed therapy for patients receiving office-based buprenorphine - A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of using video directly-observed therapy (DOT) for patients initiating buprenorphine to evaluate whether it is associated with better opioid use disorder (OUD) outcomes when compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Pilot randomized controlled trial of adult patients with OUD initiating buprenorphine treatment (n = 78) at two sites (Seattle, WA and Boston, MA) from January 2019 to May 2020. Intervention was video DOT using a HIPAA-compliant smartphone application to record taking daily buprenorphine. Study smartphones, text reminders to upload a video, and calendar summaries of video DOT adherence were provided. Main outcomes were 1) percentage of 12 weekly urine drug tests (UDT) negative for illicit opioids and 2) engagement in treatment at week 12 (i.e., having an active prescription for buprenorphine within the last 7 days). Of 78 enrolled, 20 (26 %) were female; 29 (37 %) non-white; and 31 (40 %) homeless. The mean (standard deviation) percentage of doses confirmed by video was 31 % (34 %). In intention-to-treat analysis, the average percentage of weekly opioid negative UDT was 50 % (95 % CI: 40-63 %) in the intervention arm versus 64 % (95 % CI: 55-74 %) among controls; RR = 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.60-1.02, p = 0.07). Engagement at week 12 was 69 % (95 % CI: 56-86 %) v. 82 % (95 % CI: 71-95 %) in the intervention vs. TAU arms, respectively; RR = 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.65-1.10, p = 0.20). The video DOT intervention did not result in improvements in illicit opioid use and treatment engagement compared to TAU. The study was limited by low rates of intervention use.

34705152,2022,Automated Substance Use/Sexual Risk Reporting and HIV Test Acceptance Among Emergency Department Patients Aged 13-24 Years.,"Despite federal guidelines, many adolescents and emerging adults are not offered HIV testing by their healthcare providers. As such, many-including those who may be at high-risk for contracting HIV given their sexual and/or substance use risk-are not routinely tested. The current study examines sexual risk and substance use among emergency department patients aged 13-24 years (n = 147), who completed an automated screening as part of a tablet-based intervention designed to increase HIV testing. Twenty seven percent (n = 39) of participants chose to test for HIV after completing the tablet-based intervention. Among this sample, sexual risk was a significant independent predictor of HIV testing (χ2 = 16.50, p &lt; 0.001). Problem substance use (e.g. trying but failing to quit) also predicted testing (χ2 = 7.43, p &lt; 0.01). When considering these behaviors together, analyses indicated that the effect of problem substance use (ß = 0.648, p = 0.154) on testing is explained by sexual risk behavior (ß = 1.425, p &lt; 0.01). The study's findings underscore the value of using routine automated risk screenings to collect sensitive data from emergency department patients, followed by computer-based HIV test offers for adolescent youth. Our research indicates tablet-based interventions can facilitate more accurate reporting of sexual behavior and substance use, and can also potentially increase HIV test uptake among those at risk.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Behavior;Computers;Emergency Service, Hospital;Guideline;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV Testing;Health Personnel;Humans;Patients;Research;Risk;Risk Behavior;Risk-Taking;Screening;Sexual Behavior;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Tablets;Youth",HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,AIDS Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35242282,2022,Learning Pain from Action Unit Combinations: A Weakly Supervised Approach via Multiple Instance Learning.,"Patient pain can be detected highly reliably from facial expressions using a set of facial muscle-based action units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A key characteristic of facial expression of pain is the simultaneous occurrence of pain-related AU combinations, whose automated detection would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain monitoring. Existing general Automated Facial Expression Recognition (AFER) systems prove inadequate when applied specifically for detecting pain as they either focus on detecting individual pain-related AUs but not on combinations or they seek to bypass AU detection by training a binary pain classifier directly on pain intensity data but are limited by lack of enough labeled data for satisfactory training. In this paper, we propose a new approach that mimics the strategy of human coders of decoupling pain detection into two consecutive tasks: one performed at the individual video-frame level and the other at video-sequence level. Using state-of-the-art AFER tools to detect single AUs at the frame level, we propose two novel data structures to encode AU combinations from single AU scores. Two weakly supervised learning frameworks namely multiple instance learning (MIL) and multiple clustered instance learning (MCIL) are employed corresponding to each data structure to learn pain from video sequences. Experimental results show an 87% pain recognition accuracy with 0.94 AUC (Area Under Curve) on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression dataset.

35482630,2022,Implications of epidemic-pandemic convergence for routine care adoption of contingency management: A case study.,"The significant increase in opioid-related drug overdoses during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has put an unprecedented burden on hospital emergency departments, who saw as high as an approximate 150% increase in emergency department (ED) admission rates in the initial months of the pandemic. Although overdose is a clear sign of problem drug use, only a small proportion of nonfatal overdose patients enroll in treatment within 30 days of their overdose. To bridge the gap between opioid overdoses and treatment entry, a smartphone-smart debit card contingency management program was developed to promote entry into medication-assisted treatment by out-of-treatment opioid users who have recently received care in a hospital emergency department. The case study described in this article highlights a successful implementation of this intervention despite numerous disruptions related to COVID-19 that would have made engagement difficult without the remote access to contingency management provided by this technology. Patient status over time is presented in conjunction with contingency management earnings. Technology-based contingency management may provide improved scalability, rigorous outcomes metrics, and lower costs than prior onsite, manual contingency management (CM) approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the opioid epidemic has created a context in which historical obstacles to the adoption of contingency management may be overcome. This case study demonstrates the potential utility of smartphone-based contingency management when in-person care is difficult to access or disrupted. The requirement for further research demonstrating the efficacy of these approaches is discussed.

35843139,2022,"Multi-chemokine receptor antagonist RAP-103 inhibits opioid-derived respiratory depression, reduces opioid reinforcement and physical dependence, and normalizes opioid-induced dysregulation of mesolimbic chemokine receptors in rats.","Chemokine-opioid crosstalk is a physiological crossroads for influencing therapeutic and adverse effects of opioids. Activation of chemokine receptors, especially CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR4, reduces opioid-induced analgesia by desensitizing OPRM1 receptors. Chemokine receptor antagonists (CRAs) enhance opioid analgesia, but knowledge about how CRAs impact adverse opioid effects remains limited. We examined effects of RAP-103, a multi-CRA orally active peptide analog of ""DAPTA"", on opioid-derived dependence, reinforcement, and respiratory depression in male rats and on changes in chemokine and OPRM1 (µ opioid) receptor levels in mesolimbic substrates during opioid abstinence. In rats exposed to chronic morphine (75 mg pellet x 7 d), daily RAP-103 (1 mg/kg, IP) treatment reduced the severity of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal responses. For self-administration (SA) studies, RAP-103 (1 mg/kg, IP) reduced heroin acquisition (0.1 mg/kg/inf) and reinforcing efficacy (assessed by motivation on a progressive-ratio reinforcement schedule) but did not impact sucrose intake. RAP-103 (1-3 mg/kg, IP) also normalized the deficits in oxygen saturation and enhancement of respiratory rate caused by morphine (5 mg/kg, SC) exposure. Abstinence from chronic morphine elicited brain-region specific changes in chemokine receptor protein levels. CCR2 and CXCR4 were increased in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), whereas CCR2 and CCR5 were reduced in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). Effects of RAP-103 (1 mg/kg, IP) were focused in the NAC, where it normalized morphine-induced deficits in CCR2 and CCR5.

33422652,2021,Targeting T-type/CaV3.2 channels for chronic pain.,"T-type calcium channels regulate neuronal excitability and are important contributors of pain processing. CaV3.2 channels are the major isoform expressed in nonpeptidergic and peptidergic nociceptive neurons and are emerging as promising targets for pain treatment. Numerous studies have shown that CaV3.2 expression and/or activity are significantly increased in spinal dorsal horn and in dorsal root ganglia neurons in different inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Pharmacological campaigns to inhibit the functional expression of CaV3.2 for treatment of pain have focused on the development of direct channel blockers, but none have produced lead candidates. Targeting the proteins that regulate the trafficking or transcription, and the ones that modify the channels via post-translational modifications are alternative means to regulate expression and function of CaV3.2 channels and hence to develop new drugs to control pain. Here we synthesize data supporting a role for CaV3.2 in numerous pain modalities and then discuss emerging opportunities for the indirect targeting of CaV3.2 channels.","Animals;Biophysical Phenomena;Calcium Channel Blockers;Calcium Channels, T-Type;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Drug Development;Ganglia, Spinal;Glycosylation;Humans;Lead;Models, Molecular;Neuralgia;Neurons;News;Nociceptors;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphorylation;Protein Isoforms;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Proteins;Role;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics;Transcription, Genetic;Translational Research;Ubiquitination",Chronic Pain;Neuralgia;Pain,Transl Res,Cross-Cutting Projects,Like,
32773946,2020,"SYNTHESIS OF 1,3,4-OXADIAZOLES AS SELECTIVE T-TYPE CALCIUM CHANNEL INHIBITORS.","Neuropathic pain, epilepsy, insomnia, and tremor disorder may arrive from an increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration through a dysfunction of T-type Ca2+ channels. Thus, T-type calcium channels could be a target in drug discovery for the treatments of neuropathic pain and epilepsy. From rational drug design approach, a group of 2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole molecules was synthesized and their selective T-type channel inhibitions were evaluated. The synthetic strategy consists of a short sequence of three reactions: (i) condensation of thiosemicarbazide with acid chlorides; (ii) ring closing by 1,3-dibromo-5,5- dimethylhydantoin; and (iii) coupling with various acid chlorides. 5-Chloro-N-(5- phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide (11) was found to selectively inhibit T-type Ca2+ channel over Na+ and K+ channels in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and/or human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells and to suppress seizure-induced death in mouse model. Consequently, compound 11 is a useful probe for investigation of physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of the T-channel, and provides a basis to develop a novel therapeutic to treat chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pains.","Acids;Calcium Channels, T-Type;Chlorides;Death;Drug Design;Drug Discovery;Epilepsy;Ganglia, Spinal;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Kidney;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Oxadiazoles;Pain;Role;Seizures;Sleeplessness;Therapeutics;Thiophenes;Tremor",Death;Epilepsy;Ganglion Cysts;Neuralgia;Pain;Seizures;Sleeplessness;Tremor,Heterocycles,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35817166,2022,Potentiation of morphine antinociception and inhibition of diabetic neuropathic pain by the multi-chemokine receptor antagonist peptide RAP-103.,"We determined the ability of the multi-chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5/CCR8) antagonist RAP-103 to modulate pain behaviors in an acute model of surgical pain, with and without an added opioid (morphine), and by itself in a chronic model of Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Pain behaviors were assessed by mechanical and thermal tests in rats. Cytokine and chemokine biomarkers in sciatic nerve and spinal cord were assessed by in situ qPCR. In the incisional pain assay, RAP-103 (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.p.) alone had no antiallodynic effect post-surgery. RAP-103 (0.5 mg/kg) when co-administered with morphine (0.5-5 mg/kg), reduced the ED50 of morphine from 3.19 mg/kg to 1.42 mg/kg. In a DPN model, rats exhibited persistent mechanical and cold allodynia. Oral administration of RAP-103 (0.5-0.02 mg/kg/day) resulted in a complete reversal of established hypersensitivity in DPN rats (P &lt; .001), which gradually returned to pain hypersensitivity after the cessation of the treatment. The mRNA expression of cytokines, IL-1β, TNFα; chemokines CCL2, CCL3; and chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 in DPN rat sciatic nerve, but not spinal cord, were significantly increased. RAP-103 resulted in significant reductions in sciatic nerve expression of IL-1β, TNFα and CCL3 in STZ-induced diabetic rats with trends toward lower levels for CCL2 and CCR5, while CCR2 was unchanged. In acute pain, co-administration of RAP-103 with morphine provided the same antinociceptive effect with a reduced dose of morphine, reducing opioid side-effects and risks. RAP-103 by itself is an effective non-opioid antinociceptive treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain.","Ability;Acute Pain;Administration;Administration, Oral;Allodynia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior;Biomarkers;Chemokine CCL2;Chemokines;Cold Temperature;Cytokines;Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental;Diabetic Neuropathies;General Surgery;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Interleukin-1beta;Morphine;NAD;Neuralgia;Opioids;Pain;Peptides;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Polymerase Chain Reaction;RNA, Messenger;Rats;Receptors, Chemokine;Risk;Sciatic Nerve;Spinal Cord;Streptozocin;Therapeutics;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Acute Pain;Allodynia;Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental;Diabetic Neuropathies;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Necrosis;Neoplasms;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases",Life Sci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
30544046,2019,Engineering hyaline cartilage from mesenchymal stem cells with low hypertrophy potential via modulation of culture conditions and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell source to regenerate articular cartilage, but current chondroinduction protocols, commonly using transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), lead to concomitant chondrocytic hypertrophy with ossification risk. Here, we showed that a 14-day culture of MSC-laden hyaluronic acid hydrogel in the presence of TGFβ, followed by 7 days culture in TGFβ-free medium, with the supplement of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 from day 10-21, resulted in significantly reduced hypertrophy phenotype. The stability of the hyaline phenotype of the MSC-derived cartilage, generated with a standard protocol (Control) or the optimized (Optimized) method developed in this study, was further examined through intramuscular implantation in nude mice. After 4 weeks, constructs from the Control group showed obvious mineralization; in contrast, the Optimized group displayed no signs of mineralization, and maintained cartilaginous histology. Further analysis showed that TGFβ treatment time affected p38 expression, while exposure to XAV939 significantly inhibited P-Smad 1/5 level, which together resulted in decreased level of Runx2. These findings suggest a novel treatment regimen to generate hyaline cartilage from human MSCs-loaded scaffolds, which have a minimal risk of eliciting endochondral ossification.","Animals;Cartilage;Cartilage, Articular;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Chondrogenesis;Control Groups;Culture;Endochondral Ossification;Engineering;Female;Histology;Humans;Hyalin;Hyaline Cartilage;Hyaluronic Acid;Hydrogels;Hypertrophy;Lead;Male;Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Methods;Mice, Nude;Mice, SCID;Osteogenesis;Phenotype;Risk;Standards;Therapeutics;Time;Tissue Engineering;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Wnt Signaling Pathway;beta Catenin",Hypertrophy,Biomaterials,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
31481516,2019,The Opioid Crisis and the Future of Addiction and Pain Therapeutics.,"Opioid misuse and addiction are a public health crisis resulting in debilitation, deaths, and significant social and economic impact. Curbing this crisis requires collaboration among academic, government, and industrial partners toward the development of effective nonaddictive pain medications, interventions for opioid overdose, and addiction treatments. A 2-day meeting, The Opioid Crisis and the Future of Addiction and Pain Therapeutics: Opportunities, Tools, and Technologies Symposium, was held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to address these concerns and to chart a collaborative path forward. The meeting was supported by the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-TermSM (HEAL) Initiative, an aggressive, trans-agency effort to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid crisis. The event was unique in bringing together two research disciplines, addiction and pain, in order to create a forum for crosscommunication and collaboration. The output from the symposium will be considered by the HEAL Initiative; this article summarizes the scientific presentations and key takeaways. Improved understanding of the etiology of acute and chronic pain will enable the discovery of novel targets and regulatable pain circuits for safe and effective therapeutics, as well as relevant biomarkers to ensure adequate testing in clinical trials. Applications of improved technologies including reagents, assays, model systems, and validated probe compounds will likely increase the delivery of testable hypotheses and therapeutics to enable better health outcomes for patients. The symposium goals were achieved by increasing interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate solutions for this pressing public health challenge and provide a framework for focused efforts within the research community. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This article summarizes key messages and discussions resulting from a 2-day symposium focused on challenges and opportunities in developing addiction- and pain-related medications. Speakers and attendees came from 40 states in the United States and 15 countries, bringing perspectives from academia, industry, government, and healthcare by researchers, clinicians, regulatory experts, and patient advocates.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior, Addictive;Biomarkers;Chart;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Community;Comprehension;Congresses as Topic;Death;Economics;Forecasting;Future;Goals;Government;Health;Health Care;Humans;Industry;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Patients;Public Health;Reagents;Research;Research Personnel;Solutions;Technology;Therapeutics;United States",Chronic Pain;Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32224158,2020,Adaptation of robust Z' factor for assay quality assessment in microelectrode array based screening using adult dorsal root ganglion neurons.,"Cell-based assays comprising primary sensory neurons cultured in vitro are an emerging tool for the screening and identification of potential analgesic compounds and chronic pain treatments. High-content screening (HCS) platforms for drug screening are characterized by a measure of assay quality indicator, such as the Z'-factor, which considers the signal dynamic range and data variation using control compounds only. Although widely accepted as a quality metric in high throughput screening (HTS), standard Z'-factor are not well-suited to indicate the quality of complex cell-based assays. The present study describes a method to assess assay quality in the context of extracellular recordings from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons cultured on multi-well microelectrode arrays. Data transformations are applied to electrophysiological parameters, such as electrode and well spike rates, for valid normality assumptions and suitability for use as a sample signal. Importantly, using transformed well-wide metrics, a robust version of the Z'-factor was applied, based on the median and median absolute deviation, to indicate assay quality and assess hit identification of putative pharmacological compounds. Application of appropriately scaled data and robust statistics ensured insensitivity to data variation and approximation of normal distribution. The use median and median absolute deviation of log transformed well spike rates in computing the Z'-factor revealed a value of 0.61, which is accepted as an ""excellent assay."" Known antagonists of nociceptor-specific voltage-gated sodium ion channels were identified as true hits in the present assay format under both spontaneous and thermally stimulated conditions. The present approach demonstrated a large signal dynamic range and reduced sensitivity to data variation compared to standard Z'-factor used widely in HTS. Overall, the present study provides a statistical basis for the implementation of a HCS platform utilizing adult DRG neurons on microelectrode arrays.","Adult;Analgesics;Benchmarks;Cells;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Electrodes;Ganglia, Spinal;High-Throughput Screening;High-Throughput Screening Assays;In Vitro;Indicators;Measures;Methods;Microelectrodes;Neurons;Nociceptors;Normal Distribution;Normality;Overall;Screening;Sensitivity;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sodium Channels;Standards;Statistics;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts,J Neurosci Methods,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
32429423,2020,Conserved Expression of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 Contribute to the Spontaneous and Thermally Evoked Excitability in IL-6 and NGF-Sensitized Adult Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons In Vitro.,"Sensory neurons respond to noxious stimuli by relaying information from the periphery to the central nervous system via action potentials driven by voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically Nav1.7 and Nav1.8. These channels play a key role in the manifestation of inflammatory pain. The ability to screen compounds that modulate voltage-gated sodium channels using cell-based assays assumes that key channels present in vivo is maintained in vitro. Prior electrophysiological work in vitro utilized acutely dissociated tissues, however, maintaining this preparation for long periods is difficult. A potential alternative involves multi-electrode arrays which permit long-term measurements of neural spike activity and are well suited for assessing persistent sensitization consistent with chronic pain. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of two inflammatory mediators associated with chronic inflammatory pain, nerve growth factor (NGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), to adult DRG neurons increases their firing rates on multi-electrode arrays in vitro. Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 proteins are readily detected in cultured neurons and contribute to evoked activity. The blockade of both Nav1.7 and Nav1.8, has a profound impact on thermally evoked firing after treatment with IL-6 and NGF. This work underscores the utility of multi-electrode arrays for pharmacological studies of sensory neurons and may facilitate the discovery and mechanistic analyses of anti-nociceptive compounds.","Ability;Action Potentials;Adult;Aftercare;Cells;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Electrodes;Ganglia, Spinal;Growth Factors;In Vitro;Inflammation;Interleukin-6;Microelectrodes;Nerve Growth Factor;Nerve Pain;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Permits;Play;Proteins;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Tissues;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels;Work",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Nerve Pain;Pain,Bioengineering (Basel),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33738089,2021,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with opioid use disorder with brain organoids.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated a preexisting epidemic: the opioid crisis. Much literature has shown that the circumstances imposed by COVID-19, such as social distancing regulations, medical and financial instability, and increased mental health issues, have been detrimental to those with opioid use disorder (OUD). In addition, unexpected neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients suggest that COVID-19 compromises neuroimmunity, induces hypoxia, and causes respiratory depression, provoking similar effects as those caused by opioid exposure. Combined conditions of COVID-19 and OUD could lead to exacerbated complications. With limited human in vivo options to study these complications, we suggest that iPSC-derived brain organoid models may serve as a useful platform to investigate the physiological connection between COVID-19 and OUD.

34452921,2021,Morphine-sensitive synaptic transmission emerges in embryonic rat microphysiological model of lower afferent nociceptive signaling.,"Debilitating chronic pain resulting from genetic predisposition, injury, or acquired neuropathy is becoming increasingly pervasive. Opioid analgesics remain the gold standard for intractable pain, but overprescription of increasingly powerful and addictive opioids has contributed to the current prescription drug abuse epidemic. There is a pressing need to screen experimental compounds more efficiently for analgesic potential that remains unmet by conventional research models. The spinal cord dorsal horn is a common target for analgesic intervention, where peripheral nociceptive signals are relayed to the central nervous system through synaptic transmission. Here, we demonstrate that coculturing peripheral and dorsal spinal cord nerve cells in a novel bioengineered microphysiological system facilitates self-directed emergence of native nerve tissue macrostructure and concerted synaptic function. The mechanistically distinct analgesics-morphine, lidocaine, and clonidine-differentially and predictably modulate this microphysiological synaptic transmission. Screening drug candidates for similar microphysiological profiles will efficiently identify therapeutics with analgesic potential.","Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Clonidine;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Epidemics;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Gold;Injuries;Lidocaine;Morphine;Natives;Needs;Nerve Tissue;Neurons;Nociception;Opioids;Pain, Intractable;Prescription Drug Abuse;Rats;Research;Self;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Standards;Synaptic Transmission;Therapeutics","Chronic Pain;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Injuries;Pain, Intractable;Prescription Drug Abuse",Sci Adv,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34464823,2021,Graphene oxide-functionalized nanocomposites promote osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells via enhancement of BMP-SMAD1/5 signaling pathway.,"Biomaterials that can harness the intrinsic osteogenic potential of stem cells offer a promising strategy to accelerate bone regeneration and repair. Previously, we had used methacrylated gelatin (GelMA)-based scaffolds to achieve bone formation from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In this study, we aimed to further enhance hMSC osteogenesis by incorporating graphene oxide (GO)-based nanosheets into GelMA. In vitro results showed high viability and metabolic activities in hMSCs encapsulated in the newly developed nanocomposites. Incorporation of GO markedly increased mineralization within hMSC-laden constructs, which was further increased by replacing GO with silica-coated graphene oxide (SiGO). Mechanistic analysis revealed that the nanosheet enhanced the production, retention, and biological activity of endogenous bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), resulting in robust osteogenesis in the absence of exogenous osteoinductive growth factors. Specifically, the osteoinductive effect of the nanosheets was abolished by inhibiting the BMP signaling pathway with LDN-193189 treatment. The bone formation potential of the technology was further tested in vivo using a mouse subcutaneous implantation model, where hMSCs-laden GO/GelMA and SiGO/GelMA samples resulted in bone volumes 108 and 385 times larger, respectively, than the GelMA control group. Taken together, these results demonstrate the biological activity and mechanism of action of GO-based nanosheets in augmenting the osteogenic capability of hMSCs, and highlights the potential of leveraging nanomaterials such as GO and SiGO for bone tissue engineering applications.",Biocompatible Materials;Biopharmaceuticals;Bone Morphogenetic Proteins;Bone Regeneration;Bone Tissue;Bones;Cell Differentiation;Control Groups;Engineering;Gelatin;Gels;Graphene;Graphite;Growth Factors;Humans;In Vitro;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Mice;Nanocomposites;Nanostructures;Osteogenesis;Oxides;Production;Signal Transduction;Silicon;Silicon Dioxide;Stem Cells;Technology;Therapeutics;Time;Tissue Scaffolds,,Biomaterials,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34510139,2022,Voltage-gated calcium currents in human dorsal root ganglion neurons.,"Voltage-gated calcium channels in sensory neurons underlie processes ranging from neurotransmitter release to gene expression and remain a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain. Yet virtually all we know about voltage-gated calcium channels has been obtained through the study of rodent sensory neurons and heterologously expressed channels. To address this, high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents in dissociated human and rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were characterized with whole-cell patch clamp techniques. The HVA currents from both species shared basic biophysical and pharmacological properties. However, HVA currents in human neurons differed from those in the rat in at least 3 potentially important ways: (1) Ca2+ current density was significantly smaller, (2) the proportion of nifedipine-sensitive currents was far greater, and (3) a subpopulation of human neurons displayed relatively large constitutive current inhibition. These results highlight the need to for the study of native proteins in their native environment before initiating costly clinical trials.","Address;Animals;Calcium;Calcium Channel Blockers;Calcium Channels;Cells;Clinical Trial;Environment;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Humans;Natives;Needs;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Nifedipine;Pain;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Proteins;Rats;Rodentia;Sensory Receptor Cells;Therapeutics",Ganglion Cysts;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

35747924,2022,Global analyses of mRNA expression in human sensory neurons reveal eIF5A as a conserved target for inflammatory pain.,"Nociceptors are a type of sensory neuron that are integral to most forms of pain. Targeted disruption of nociceptor sensitization affords unique opportunities to prevent pain. An emerging model for nociceptors are sensory neurons derived from human stem cells. Here, we subjected five groups to high-throughput sequencing: human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) prior to differentiation, mature hiPSC-derived sensory neurons, mature co-cultures containing hiPSC-derived astrocytes and sensory neurons, mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues, and mouse DRG cultures. Co-culture of nociceptors and astrocytes promotes expression of transcripts enriched in DRG tissues. Comparisons of the hiPSC models to tissue samples reveal that many key transcripts linked to pain are present. Markers indicative of a range of neuronal subtypes present in the DRG were detected in mature hiPSCs. Intriguingly, translation factors were maintained at consistently high expression levels across species and culture systems. As a proof of concept for the utility of this resource, we validated expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in DRG tissues and hiPSC samples. eIF5A is subject to a unique posttranslational hypusine modification required for its activity. Inhibition of hypusine biosynthesis prevented hyperalgesic priming by inflammatory mediators in vivo and diminished hiPSC activity in vitro. Collectively, our results illuminate the transcriptomes of hiPSC sensory neuron models. We provide a demonstration for this resource through our investigation of eIF5A. Our findings reveal hypusine as a potential target for inflammation associated pain in males.","Animals;Astrocytes;Coculture Techniques;Culture;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-5;Form;Ganglia, Spinal;High-Throughput Sequencing;Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Humans;In Vitro;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Inflammation;Male;Mice;Nociceptors;Pain;RNA, Messenger;Resources;Sensory Receptor Cells;Stem Cells;Tissues;Transcriptome;Translations",Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Pain,FASEB J,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35977512,2022,STK25 inhibits PKA signaling by phosphorylating PRKAR1A.,"In the heart, protein kinase A (PKA) is critical for activating calcium handling and sarcomeric proteins in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation leading to increased myocardial contractility and performance. The catalytic activity of PKA is tightly regulated by regulatory subunits that inhibit the catalytic subunit until released by cAMP binding. Phosphorylation of type II regulatory subunits promotes PKA activation; however, the role of phosphorylation in type I regulatory subunits remain uncertain. Here, we utilize human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to identify STK25 as a kinase of the type Iα regulatory subunit PRKAR1A. Phosphorylation of PRKAR1A leads to inhibition of PKA kinase activity and increased binding to the catalytic subunit in the presence of cAMP. Stk25 knockout in mice diminishes Prkar1a phosphorylation, increases Pka activity, and augments contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Together, these data support STK25 as a negative regulator of PKA signaling through phosphorylation of PRKAR1A.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Adrenergic Agents;Animals;Calcium;Catalytic Domain;Cell Biology;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Heart;Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Lead;Mice;Molecular Biology;Myocytes, Cardiac;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proteins;Role;Signal Transduction",,Cell Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33631356,2021,Collaborative care in the treatment of opioid use disorder and mental health conditions in primary care: A clinical study protocol.,"People with opioid use disorder (OUD) often have a co-occurring psychiatric disorder, which elevates the risk of morbidity and mortality. Promising evidence supports the use of collaborative care for treating people with OUD in primary care. Whether collaborative care interventions that treat both OUD and psychiatric disorders will result in better outcomes is presently unknown. The Whole Health Study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial designed to test collaborative care treatment for OUD and the psychiatric disorders that commonly accompany OUD. Approximately 1200 primary care patients aged ≥18 years with OUD and depression, anxiety, or PTSD will be randomized to one of three conditions: (1) Augmented Usual Care, which consists of a primary care physician (PCP) waivered to prescribe buprenorphine and an addiction psychiatrist to consult on medication-assisted treatment; (2) Collaborative Care, which consists of a waivered PCP, a mental health care manager trained in psychosocial treatments for OUD and psychiatric disorders, and an addiction psychiatrist who provides consultation for OUD and mental health; or (3) Collaborative Care Plus, which consists of all the elements of the Collaborative Care arm plus a Certified Recovery Specialist to help with treatment engagement and retention. Primary outcomes are six-month rates of opioid use and six-month rates of remission of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. The Whole Health Study will investigate whether collaborative care models that address OUD and co-occurring depression, anxiety, or PTSD will result in better patient outcomes.

33713840,2021,Design of CLARO (Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from other Stresses): A randomized trial of collaborative care for opioid use disorder and co-occurring depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) co-occurring with depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common and, if untreated, may lead to devastating consequences. Despite the availability of evidence-based treatments for these disorders, receipt of treatment is low. Even when treatment is provided, quality is variable. Primary care is an important and underutilized setting for treating co-occurring disorders (COD) because OUD, depression and PTSD are frequently co-morbid with medical conditions and most people visit a primary care provider at least once a year. With rising rates of OUD and opioid-related fatalities, this is a critical treatment and quality gap in a vulnerable and stigmatized population. CLARO (Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses) is a multi-site, randomized pragmatic trial of collaborative care (CC) for co-occurring disorders in 13 rural and urban primary care clinics in New Mexico to improve care for patients with OUD and co-occurring depression and/or PTSD. CC, a service delivery approach that uses multi-faceted interventions, has not been tested with COD. We will enroll and randomize 900 patients to either CC adapted for COD (CC-COD) or enhanced usual care (EUC) and will collect patient data at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Our primary outcomes are medications for OUD (MOUD) access, MOUD continuity of care, depression symptoms, and PTSD symptoms.

33980315,2021,"Housing, opportunities, motivation and engagement (HOME) for homeless youth at-risk for opioid use disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as ""Housing First,"" has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18-24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

35395811,2022,Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses (CLARO): process of adapting collaborative care for co-occurring opioid use and mental disorders.,"Opioid use disorders (OUD), co-occurring with either depression and/or PTSD, are prevalent, burdensome, and often receive little or low-quality care. Collaborative care is a service delivery intervention that uses a team-based model to improve treatment access, quality, and outcomes in primary care patients, but has not been evaluated for co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. To address this treatment and quality gap, we adapted collaborative care for co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. Our adapted model is called Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses (CLARO). We used the five-step Map of Adaptation Process (McKleroy in AIDS Educ Prev 18:59-73, 2006) to develop the model. For each step, our stakeholder team of research and clinical experts, primary care partners, and patients provided input into adaptation processes (e.g., adaptation team meetings, clinic partner feedback, patient interviews and beta-testing). To document each adaptation and our decision-making process, we used the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (Wiltsey Stirman in Implement Sci 14:1-10, 2019). We documented 12 planned fidelity-consistent adaptations to collaborative care, including a mix of content, context, and training/evaluation modifications intended to improve fit with the patient population (co-occurring disorders) or the New Mexico setting (low-resource clinics in health professional shortage areas). Examples of documented adaptations include use of community health workers as care coordinators; an expanded consultant team to support task-shifting to community health workers; modified training protocols for Problem-Solving Therapy and Written Exposure Therapy to incorporate examples of treating patients for depression or PTSD with co-occurring OUD; and having care coordinators screen for patients' social needs. We completed the first three steps of the Map of Adaptation Process, resulting in a variety of adaptations that we believe will make collaborative care more acceptable and feasible in treating co-occurring OUD and mental health disorders. Future steps include evaluating the effectiveness of CLARO and documenting reactive and/or planned adaptations to the model that occur during its implementation and delivery.

35771866,2022,The association of prescription opioid use with suicide attempts: An analysis of statewide medical claims data.,"Suicides and opioid overdose deaths are among the most pressing public health concerns in the US. However direct evidence for the association between opioid use and suicidal behavior is limited. The objective of this article is to examine the association between frequency and dose of prescription opioid use and subsequent suicide attempts. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 4 years of statewide medical claims data from the Connecticut All-Payer Claims Database. Commercially insured adult patients in Connecticut (n = 842,773) who had any medical claims beginning in January 2012 were followed through December 2015. The primary outcome was suicide attempt identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD 9) diagnosis codes. Primary predictor variables included frequency of opioid use, which was defined as the number of months with claims for prescription opioids per year, and strength of opioid dose, which was standardized using morphine milligram equivalent (MME) units. We also controlled for psychiatric and medical comorbidities using ICD 9 codes. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between frequency, dose, and suicide attempts, adjusting for medical and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Interactions among measures of opioid use and comorbid conditions were analyzed. In this cohort study with follow-up time up to 4 years (range = 2-48 months, median = 46 months), the hazard ratios (HR) from the time-to-event analysis indicated that patients prescribed opioid medications for at least 6 months during the past year and at 20-50 MME levels or higher had 4.44 (95% CI: [3.71, 5.32]) to 7.23 (95% CI: [6.22, 8.41]) times the risk of attempted suicide compared to those not prescribed opioids. Risk of suicide attempt was sharply elevated among patients with psychiatric conditions other than anxiety who were prescribed more frequent and higher opioid doses. In contrast, more frequent and higher doses of prescription opioids were associated with lower risk of suicide attempts among patients with medical conditions necessitating pain management. This study is limited by its exclusive focus on commercially insured patients and does not include patients covered by public insurance. It is also limited to patients' receipt of prescription opioids and does not take into account opioids obtained through other means, nor does it include measures of actual patient opioid use. This analysis provides evidence of a complex relationship among prescription opioids, mental health, pain and other medical comorbidities, and suicide risk. Findings indicate the need for proactive suicide surveillance among individuals diagnosed with affective or psychotic disorders who are receiving frequent and high doses of opioids. However, appropriate opioid treatment may have significant value in reducing suicide risk for those without psychiatric comorbidities.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Association;Behavior;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Connecticut;Database;Death;Diagnosis;Humans;ICD-9;Insurance;International Classification of Diseases;Measures;Mental Health;Morphine;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Prescriptions;Psychotic Disorders;Public Health;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Suicide;Suicide, Attempted;Therapeutics;Time",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Psychotic Disorders,PLoS One,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35785613,2022,Integrating peer support services into primary care-based OUD treatment: Lessons from the Penn integrated model.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major public health emergency in the United States. In 2020, 2.7 million individuals had an OUD. Medication for opioid use disorder is the evidence-based, standard of care for treating OUD in outpatient settings, especially buprenorphine because it is effective and has low toxicity. Buprenorphine is increasingly prescribed in primary care, a setting that provides greater anonymity and convenience than substance use disorder treatment centers. Yet two-thirds of people who begin buprenorphine treatment discontinue within the first six months. Treatment dropout elevates the risks of return to use, infections, higher levels of medical care and related costs, justice system involvement, and death. One promising form of retention support is peer service programs. Peers combine their lived experience of substance use and recovery with formal training to help patients engage and persist in OUD treatment. They provide a range of services, including health education, encouragement and empathy, coping skills, recovery modeling, and concrete assistance in overcoming the situational barriers to retention. However, guidance is needed to define the peer role in primary care, the specific tasks peers should perform, the competencies those tasks require, training and professional development needs, and peer performance standards. Guidance also is needed to integrate peers into the care team, allocate and coordinate responsibilities among care team members, manage peer operations and workflow, and facilitate effective team communication. Here we describe a peer support program in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS or Penn Medicine) network of primary care practices. This paper details the program's core components, values, and activities. We also report the organizational challenges, unresolved questions, and lessons for the field in administering a peer support program to meet the needs of patients served by a large, urban medical system with an extensive suburban and rural catchment area.

33463473,2021,Non-canonical Molecular Targets for Novel Analgesics: Intracellular Calcium and HCN Channels.,"Pain is a prevalent biopsychosocial condition that poses a significant challenge to healthcare providers, contributes substantially to a disability, and is a major economic burden worldwide. An overreliance on opioid analgesics, which primarily target the μ-opioid receptor, has caused devastating morbidity and mortality in the form of misuse and overdose-related death. Thus, novel analgesic medications are needed that can effectively treat pain and provide an alternative to opioids. A variety of cellular ion channels contribute to nociception, the response of the sensory nervous system to a noxious stimulus that commonly leads to pain. Ion channels involved in nociception may provide a suitable target for pharmacologic modulation to achieve pain relief. This narrative review summarizes the evidence for two ion channels that merit consideration as targets for non-opioid pain medications: ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are intracellular calcium channels, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated K+ channels. The role of these channels in nociception and neuropathic pain is discussed and suitability as targets for novel analgesics and antihyperalgesics is considered.","Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Calcium;Calcium Channels;Death;Drug Development;Economics;Form;Health Personnel;Humans;Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels;Ion Channels;Lead;Morbidity;Mortality;Nervous System;Neuralgia;Nociception;Nucleotides, Cyclic;Opioids;Pain;Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Review;Role;Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel",Death;Neuralgia;Pain,Curr Neuropharmacol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34948407,2021,Single-Dose P2 X4R Single-Chain Fragment Variable Antibody Permanently Reverses Chronic Pain in Male Mice.,"Non-opioid single-chain variable fragment (scFv) small antibodies were generated as pain-reducing block of P2X4R receptor (P2X4R). A panel of scFvs targeting an extracellular peptide sequence of P2X4R was generated followed by cell-free ribosome display for recombinant antibody selection. After three rounds of bio-panning, a panel of recombinant antibodies was isolated and characterized by ELISA, cross-reactivity analysis, and immunoblotting/immunostaining. Generated scFv antibodies feature binding activity similar to monoclonal antibodies but with stronger affinity and increased tissue penetrability due to their ~30% smaller size. Two anti-P2X4R scFv clones (95, 12) with high specificity and affinity binding were selected for in vivo testing in male and female mice with trigeminal nerve chronic neuropathic pain (FRICT-ION model) persisting for several months in untreated BALBc mice. A single dose of P2X4R scFv (4 mg/kg, i.p.) successfully, completely, and permanently reversed chronic neuropathic pain-like measures in male mice only, providing retention of baseline behaviors indefinitely. Untreated mice retained hypersensitivity, and developed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors within 5 weeks. In vitro P2X4R scFv 95 treatment significantly increased the rheobase of larger-diameter (&gt;25 µm) trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons from FRICT-ION mice compared to controls. The data support use of engineered scFv antibodies as non-opioid biotherapeutic interventions for chronic pain.","Animals;Antibodies;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Antibody Affinity;Anxiety;Behavior;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Chronic Pain;Clone Cells;Depression;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Female;Hypersensitivity;Immunoblotting;In Vitro;Injuries;Ions;Male;Measures;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Opioids;Pain;Peptide Library;Peptides;Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists;Receptors, Purinergic P2X4;Recombinant Proteins;Ribosomes;Single-Chain Antibodies;Specificity;Therapeutics;Tissues;Trigeminal Ganglion;Trigeminal Nerve",Chronic Pain;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Int J Mol Sci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of MRGPRX1 have the potential to preferentially activate the receptors at the central terminals of primary sensory neurons and minimize itch side effects caused by peripheral activation. Using a high-throughput screening (HTS) hit, a series of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based molecules were synthesized and evaluated as human MRGPRX1 PAMs in HEK293 cells stably transfected with human MrgprX1 gene. An iterative process to improve potency and metabolic stability led to the discovery of orally available 6-(tert-butyl)-5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(2-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine (1t), which can be distributed to the spinal cord, the presumed site of action, following oral administration. In a neuropathic pain model induced by sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI), compound 1t (100 mg/kg, po) reduced behavioral heat hypersensitivity in humanized MRGPRX1 mice, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of MRGPRX1 PAMs in treating neuropathic pain.","Administration, Oral;Allosteric Regulation;Animals;Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Chromatography, Liquid;Constriction;Genes;HEK293 Cells;Heat;High-Throughput Screening;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Mice;Neuralgia;Pain;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Pyrimidines;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Sciatic Nerve;Sensory Receptor Cells;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,J Med Chem,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

ProTx-II is a potent and moderately selective peptide toxin from tarantula venom that inhibits human NaV1.7 activation. Here we used available structural and experimental data to guide Rosetta design of potent and selective ProTx-II-based peptide inhibitors of human NaV1.7 channels. Functional testing of designed peptides using electrophysiology identified the PTx2-3127 and PTx2-3258 peptides with IC50s of 7 nM and 4 nM for hNaV1.7 and more than 1000-fold selectivity over human NaV1.1, NaV1.3, NaV1.4, NaV1.5, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9 channels. PTx2-3127 inhibits NaV1.7 currents in mouse and human sensory neurons and shows efficacy in rat models of chronic and thermal pain when administered intrathecally.

31760109,2020,Integrated Behavioral Treatment for Veterans With Co-Morbid Chronic Pain and Hazardous Opioid Use: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.,"Opioid prescription in the treatment of chronic pain is frequent and carries a risk of increased morbidity and mortality in a clinically significant number of patients, particularly those who are using opioids in a hazardous manner. Few treatment options are available that target both pain-related interference and hazardous opioid use among patients with chronic pain. In military Veterans, this issue is of particular importance as numerous reports indicate continued high rates of opioid prescription for chronic pain, as well as significant opioid-related problems. The overall aim of the present study was to determine the feasibility of an integrated psychosocial treatment in Veterans with chronic pain, who also have evidence of hazardous opioid use. To examine this aim, a random design was used to assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of integrating 2 empirically supported interventions: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for chronic pain and Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for opioid misuse. Half of participants were randomized to the integrated treatment group and all participants received usual care through a Veteran's Administration co-occurring disorders medical clinic to treat chronic pain and opioid misuse. In total, 37 participants were randomized and included in intent-to-treat analyses and 32 individuals were included in per protocol analyses with 6-month follow-up serving as the primary study endpoint. Feasibility indicators included recruitment, retention, and treatment completion rates. Recruitment fell short of targeted enrollment, although retention and completion were excellent. Primary outcome measures were opioid misuse, pain interference, and pain behavior. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses controlled for pain duration, baseline opioid dose, and baseline value for outcome measures. Results of both the intent-to-treat and per protocol indicated a significant effect in favor of the integrated intervention for opioid misuse, pain interference, and pain behavior. Results support the feasibility of providing an integrated treatment for both opioid risk and pain interference. PERSPECTIVE: Opioid misuse occurs in some opioid-prescribed individuals with chronic pain. Few treatment options exist that target both pain interference and opioid misuse. This study examined feasibility and initial efficacy of an integrated behavioral treatment for Veterans. Feasibility was supported, except recruitment. Efficacy was supported compared to usual care.","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy;Adult;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Feasibility Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Indicators;Male;Middle Aged;Military Personnel;Mindfulness;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Outcome Measures;Overall;Pain;Patients;Pilots;Prescriptions;Regression Analysis;Relapse Prevention;Report;Risk;Therapeutics;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans",Chronic Pain;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Relapse,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,

34330321,2021,A digital health peri-operative cognitive-behavioral intervention to prevent transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain in adolescents undergoing spinal fusion (SurgeryPalTM): study protocol for a multisite randomized controlled trial.,"Spinal fusion surgery is associated with severe acute postsurgical pain and high rates of chronic postsurgical pain in adolescents. Psychological distress, sleep disturbance, and low pain self-efficacy predict higher acute pain and likelihood of developing chronic postsurgical pain. Interventions targeting baseline psychosocial risk factors have potential to interrupt a negative trajectory of continued pain and poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) over time but have not yet been developed and evaluated. This randomized controlled trial will test effectiveness of a digital peri-operative cognitive-behavioral intervention (SurgeryPalTM) vs. education-control delivered to adolescents and their parents to improve acute and chronic pain and health outcomes in adolescents undergoing spine surgery. Adolescents 12-18 years of age undergoing spinal fusion for idiopathic conditions, and their parent, will be recruited from pediatric centers across the USA, for a target complete sample of 400 dyads. Adolescents will be randomized into 4 study arms using a factorial design to SurgeryPalTM or education control during 2 phases of treatment: (1) pre-operative phase (one-month before surgery) and (2) post-operative phase (1 month after surgery). Acute pain severity and interference (primary acute outcomes) and opioid use will be assessed daily for 14 days following hospital discharge. Chronic pain severity and interference (primary acute outcomes), as well as HRQL, parent and adolescent distress, sleep quality, and opioid use/misuse (secondary outcomes), will be assessed at 3 months and 6 months post-surgery. Demonstration of effectiveness and understanding optimal timing of perioperative intervention will enable implementation of this scalable psychosocial intervention into perioperative care. Ultimately, the goal is to improve pain outcomes and reduce reliance on opioids in adolescents after spine surgery. NCT04637802 ClinicalTrials.gov.

35753662,2022,Opioid and Alcohol Misuse in Veterans with Chronic Pain: A Risk Screening Study.,"In United States military veterans, chronic pain represents a risk factor for opioid and alcohol misuse, yet few studies have examined interactions among chronic pain, opioid prescription, and opioid and alcohol misuse. Previous work found substantial risk of co-morbid alcohol and opioid misuse in a community sample of opioid-prescribed individuals with chronic pain, a finding expanded upon here. Specifically, 211 veterans assessed within a chronic pain treatment service for opioid-prescribed individuals completed self-report measures of opioid misuse, alcohol misuse, pain intensity, depression, pain catastrophizing, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS). Based on the substance misuse measures, 32% (n = 68) were misusing neither opioids nor alcohol, 23% (n = 48) were misusing both opioids and alcohol, 40% (n = 84) were misusing opioids alone, and 5% (n = 11) were misusing alcohol alone. Group comparisons indicated that individuals not misusing either substance were less distressed in comparison to those who were misusing opioids alone or both substances. The latter groups differed in PTS. Overall, misuse frequencies mirrored previous work, with approximately 1 of 3 misusing opioids and approximately 1 of 5 misusing both substances. There is a need for increased focus on both polysubstance misuse and the development of integrated treatment. PERSPECTIVE: Opioid and alcohol misuse was examined in 211 Veterans prescribed opioids for chronic pain. In total, 32% were not misusing either, 23% were misusing both, 40% were misusing opioids, and 5% were misusing alcohol. Veterans not misusing either were generally less disabled and distressed compared to those misusing opioids or both.","Alcoholism;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Community;Depression;Ethanol;Humans;Measures;Military Personnel;Needs;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescriptions;Risk;Risk Factors;Screening;Self Report;Therapeutics;United States;Veterans;Work",Alcoholism;Chronic Pain;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
32603263,2020,Intranasal Leptin Prevents Opioid-induced Sleep-disordered Breathing in Obese Mice.,"Respiratory depression is the main cause of morbidity and mortality associated with opioids. Obesity increases opioid-related mortality, which is mostly related to comorbid obstructive sleep apnea. Naloxone, a μ-opioid receptor blocker, is an effective antidote, but it reverses analgesia. Like humans with obesity, mice with diet-induced obesity hypoventilate during sleep and develop obstructive sleep apnea, which can be treated with intranasal leptin. We hypothesized that intranasal leptin reverses opioid-induced sleep-disordered breathing in obese mice without decreasing analgesia. To test this hypothesis, mice with diet-induced obesity were treated with morphine at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously and with leptin or placebo intranasally. Sleep and breathing were recorded by barometric plethysmography, and pain sensitivity was measured by the tail-flick test. Excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded in vitro from hypoglossal motor neurons after the application of the μ-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin and leptin. Morphine dramatically increased the frequency of apneas and greatly increased the severity of hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea. Leptin decreased the frequency of apneas, improved obstructive sleep apnea, and completely reversed hypoventilation, whereas morphine analgesia was enhanced. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin reduced the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents in hypoglossal motoneurons and that application of leptin restored excitatory synaptic neurotransmission. Our findings suggest that intranasal leptin may prevent opioid respiratory depression during sleep in patients with obesity receiving opioids without reducing analgesia.","AT 10;Administration, Intranasal;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Antidotes;Apnea;Diet;Disease Models, Animal;Enkephalins;Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents;Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials;Humans;Hypoventilation;In Vitro;Leptin;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Obese;Morbidity;Morphine;Mortality;Motor Neurons;Naloxone;Obesity;Opioid Reversal Agents;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Placebos;Plethysmography;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiration;Respiratory Depression;Sensitivity;Sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep-Disordered Breathing;Synaptic Transmission;Tail","Apnea;Hypoventilation;Obesity;Pain;Respiratory Depression;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep-Disordered Breathing",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34672945,2022,Opioids and obstructive sleep apnea.,"Opioids are widely prescribed for pain management, and it is estimated that 40% of adults in the United States use prescription opioids every year. Opioid misuse leads to high mortality, with respiratory depression as the main cause of death. Animal and human studies indicate that opioid use may lead to sleep-disordered breathing. Opioids affect control of breathing and impair upper airway function, causing central apneas, upper airway obstruction, and hypoxemia during sleep. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, even if the relationship between opioids and central sleep apnea is firmly established, the question of whether opioids can aggravate OSA remains unanswered. While several reports have shown a high prevalence of OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia in patients receiving a high dose of opioids, other studies did not find a correlation between opioid use and obstructive events. These differences can be attributed to considerable interindividual variability, divergent effects of opioids on different phenotypic traits of OSA, and wide-ranging methodology. This review will discuss mechanistic insights into the effects of opioids on the upper airway and hypoglossal motor activity and the association of opioid use and obstructive sleep apnea.

35421320,2022,Effects of fentanyl overdose-induced muscle rigidity and dexmedetomidine on respiratory mechanics and pulmonary gas exchange in sedated rats.,"The objective of our study was to establish in sedated rats the consequences of high-dose fentanyl-induced acute muscle rigidity on the mechanical properties of the respiratory system and on the metabolic rate. Doses of fentanyl that we have previously shown to produce persistent rigidity of the muscles of the limbs and trunk in the rat (150-300 μg/kg iv), were administered in 23 volume-controlled mechanically ventilated and sedated rats. The effects of a low dose of the FDA-approved central α-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine (3 μg/kg iv), which has been suggested to oppose fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity, were determined after fentanyl administration. Fentanyl produced a significant decrease in compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in all the rats that were studied. In 13 rats, an abrupt response occurred within 90 s, consisting of rapid rhythmic contractions of most skeletal muscles that were replaced by persistent tonic/tetanic contractions leading to a significant decrease of Crs (from 0.51 ± 0.11 mL/cmH2O to 0.36 ± 0.08 mL/cmH2O, 3 min after fentanyl injection). In the other 10 animals, Crs progressively decreased to 0.26 ± 0.06 mL/cmH2O at 30 min. There was a significant rise in oxygen consumption (V̇o2) during these muscle contractions (from 8.48 ± 4.31 to 11.29 ± 2.57 mL/min), which led to a significant hypoxemia, despite ventilation being held constant. Dexmedetomidine provoked a significant and rapid increase in Crs toward baseline levels, whereas decreasing the metabolic rate and restoring normoxemia. We propose that the changes in respiratory mechanics and metabolism produced by opioid-induced muscle rigidity contribute to fentanyl lethality.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The decrease in respiratory compliance and increased metabolism-induced hypoxemia produced by an overdose of fentanyl, in and of themselves, contribute to fentanyl toxicity.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Compliance;Dexmedetomidine;Extremities;Fentanyl;Hypoxemia;Hypoxia;Injections;Mechanics;Metabolism;Muscle Contraction;Muscle Rigidity;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscles;News;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Oxygen Consumption;Pulmonary Gas Exchange;Rats;Respiration;Respiratory Mechanics;Respiratory System;Ventilation",Hypoxemia;Hypoxia;Muscle Rigidity;Opiate Overdose,J Appl Physiol (1985),Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Like,
34080441,2021,Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods pilot study.,"Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported ⩾ 3 months of chronic pain and were &gt; 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).","Acupuncture;Acupuncture Therapy;Adult;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Appointments;Arm;Blacks;COVID-19;Chicago;Chronic Pain;Feasibility Studies;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Illinois;Interview;Laboratories;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Nursing;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Pilot Projects;Prospective Studies;Questionnaires;Randomized Controlled Trial;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Universities","Anemia, Sickle Cell;COVID-19;Chronic Pain;Pain",Acupunct Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34104574,2021,Acupuncture Intervention Protocol: Consensus Process for a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial of Acupuncture for Management of Chronic Low Back Pain in Older Adults: An NIH HEAL Initiative Funded Project.,"The aim of this article is to describe the consensus process used to develop an acupuncture intervention protocol for an NIH-funded pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT) of acupuncture for the management of chronic low back (cLBP) in older adults (BackInAction). CLBP is among leading causes of disability worldwide: almost 33% of US adults 65 and older experience LBP. Acupuncture is effective for cLBP but there is no specific data on older adults. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) funded a PRCT of acupuncture needling for this population. An essential trial milestone was development of a consensus intervention protocol. An Acupuncture Advisory Panel (AAP) was formed with nine members: two physician-acupuncturists, six licensed acupuncturists representing diverse work backgrounds, and an acupuncture researcher. We used a modified Delphi process that included provision of acupuncture trial data, survey data describing how each expert treats cLBP, three conference calls, and between-call email discussion. Lively and professional discussions led to a consensus intervention protocol for the BackInAction trial that included steps/staging of care, recommendations for parameters of care session length, number of needle insertion sites, insertion depths, needle retention times, recommended types of needles, both local and distal areas of the body to be treated, acupuncture point options, auricular point options, self-care options, and minimum number of sessions considered ideal. Using a modified Delphi process, an expert AAP created a consensus intervention protocol for the PRCT of acupuncture needling for cLBP in patients 65 and older.",Acupuncture;Acupuncture Points;Adult;Back;Conferences;Consensus;Electronic Mail;Health;Institutes;Low Back Pain;Needles;Patients;Physicians;Population;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research Personnel;Self Care;Surveys;Time;Treatment Protocols;Work,Low Back Pain,Glob Adv Health Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
34455111,2021,The design and methods of the OPTIMUM study: A multisite pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a telehealth group mindfulness program for persons with chronic low back pain.,"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an evidence-based non-pharmacological approach for chronic low back pain (cLBP), yet it is not readily available or reimbursable within primary care clinics. Primary care providers (PCPs) who wish to avoid prescribing opioids and other medications typically have few options for their cLBP patients. We present the protocol of a pragmatic clinical trial entitled OPTIMUM (Optimizing Pain Treatment In Medical settings Using Mindfulness). OPTIMUM is offered online via telehealth and includes medical group visits (MGV) with a PCP and a mindfulness meditation intervention modeled on MBSR for persons with cLBP. In diverse health-care settings in the US, such as a safety net hospital, federally qualified health centers, and a large academic health system, 450 patients will be assigned randomly to the MGV + MBSR or to usual PCP care alone. Participants will complete self-report surveys at baseline, following the 8-week program, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Health care utilization data will be obtained through electronic health records and via brief monthly surveys completed by participants. The primary outcome measure is the PEG (Pain, enjoyment, and general activity) at the 6-month follow-up. Additionally, we will assess psychological function, healthcare resource use, and opioid prescriptions. This trial, which is part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, has the potential to enhance primary care treatment of cLBP by combining PCP visits with a non-pharmacological treatment modeled on MBSR. Because it is offered online and integrated into primary care, it is expected to be scalable and accessible to underserved patients.

Guidelines recommend use of validated non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) approaches in conjunction with prescribed opioids and other analgesics. Our protocol outlines a population-level, pragmatic trial that will test a bundled intervention comprised of an electronic health record (EHR) portal-based conversation guide, EHR clinical decision support (CDS), and a suite of self-management educational and support materials to encourage and advance NPPC use. We are conducting a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized pragmatic trial spanning seven surgical specialties across six geographically diverse locations within the Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Thirty two surgical practices across six locations (Rochester, Minnesota; Mankato, Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Phoenix, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida) comprise 22 distinct practice clusters that are randomly assigned to one of five steps using constrained randomization. Steps ""go live"" by initiating the intervention at 7-month intervals between March 2021 and July 2023. Patients over 18 years of age who are scheduled for qualifying procedures within ""live"" consenting practices are sent a Healing After Surgery guide via their patient portals pre-operatively, directing them to identify their preferred NPPC modalities among 13 approaches. These selections create CDS options for care teams to support patients with self-management materials that reinforce safe NPPC use. Patients' clinical, demographic, and outcome data will be abstracted from the Epic EHR. Primary outcomes will be the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference and physical functioning computer adaptive tests (CAT) collected at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively via the patient portal. We will mail printed versions of the 6-item PROMIS short forms to portal non-responders to minimize bias. Secondary outcomes will include the PROMIS anxiety CAT, opioid consumption, and self-reported NPPC use.

36036838,2022,The Fibromyalgia Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in Physical Therapy Study (FM-TIPS) Protocol: A Multisite Embedded Pragmatic Trial.,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a nonpharmacological intervention that provides an electrical current through the skin to produce analgesia. The primary purpose of this study is to examine if the addition of TENS to routine physical therapy improves movement-evoked pain in individuals with fibromyalgia in a physical therapy clinical setting. FM-TIPS is a phase III embedded pragmatic clinical trial funded through the National Institutes of Health Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative. This trial will utilize a randomized cluster design that includes more than 110 physical therapists in 24 to 30 physical therapy clinics within 6 health care systems and 7 states. Clinics will be randomized to TENS or No-TENS, stratified by health care system and clinic size. The plan is to enroll 600 participants, with all participants completing physical therapy as prescribed by their physical therapist. Participants at TENS clinics will utilize TENS for a minimum of 2-hour per day while at the physical therapy clinic and at home when active. The primary outcome is reduction in movement-evoked pain from baseline to Day 60 on an 11-point numeric rating scale when participants sit and stand five times (Sit and Stand Test) Secondary outcomes include resting pain and fatigue, pain interference, fibromyalgia disease activity, movement-evoked fatigue, multidimensional assessment of fatigue, rapid assessment of physical activity, patient global impression of change, and common data elements shared across studies supported through the HEAL Initiative.","Analgesia;Chronic Pain;Common Data Elements;Disease;Exercise;Fatigue;Fibromyalgia;Health Care Systems;Movement;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Pain;Patients;Physical Therapists;Physical Therapy;Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic;Pragmatic Clinical Trial;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Scales;Skin;Time;Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation",Chronic Pain;Fatigue;Fibromyalgia;Pain,Phys Ther,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Like,
36351735,2022,BeatPain Utah: study protocol for a pragmatic randomised trial examining telehealth strategies to provide non-pharmacologic pain care for persons with chronic low back pain receiving care in federally qualified health centers.,"Although evidence-based guidelines recommend non-pharmacologic treatments as first-line care for chronic low back pain (LBP), uptake has been limited, particularly in rural, low-income and ethnically diverse communities. The BeatPain study will evaluate the implementation and compare the effectiveness of two strategies to provide non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic LBP. The study will use telehealth to overcome access barriers for persons receiving care in federally qualified health centres (FQHCs) in the state of Utah. BeatPain Utah is a pragmatic randomised clinical trial with a hybrid type I design investigating different strategies to provide non-pharmacologic care for adults with chronic LBP seen in Utah FQHCs. The intervention strategies include a brief pain consult (BPC) and telehealth physical therapy (PT) component provided using either an adaptive or sequenced delivery strategy across two 12-week treatment phases. Interventions are provided via telehealth by centrally located physical therapists. The sequenced delivery strategy provides the BPC, followed by telehealth PT in the first 12 weeks for all patients. The adaptive strategy uses a stepped care approach and provides the BPC in the first 12 weeks and telehealth PT to patients who are non-responders to the BPC component. We will recruit 500 English-speaking or Spanish-speaking participants who will be individually randomised with 1:1 allocation. The primary outcome is the Pain, Enjoyment and General Activity measure of pain impact with secondary outcomes including the additional pain assessment domains specified by the National Institutes (NIH) of Health Helping to End Addiction Long Initiative and implementation measures. Analyses of primary and secondary measures of effectiveness will be performed under longitudinal mixed effect models across assessments at baseline, and at 12, 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of Utah Institutional Review Board. On completion, study data will be made available in compliance with NIH data sharing policies.

29311050,2018,Detecting Novel and Emerging Drug Terms Using Natural Language Processing: A Social Media Corpus Study.,"With the rapid development of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and changes in the use of more traditional drugs, it is increasingly difficult for researchers and public health practitioners to keep up with emerging drugs and drug terms. Substance use surveys and diagnostic tools need to be able to ask about substances using the terms that drug users themselves are likely to be using. Analyses of social media may offer new ways for researchers to uncover and track changes in drug terms in near real time. This study describes the initial results from an innovative collaboration between substance use epidemiologists and linguistic scientists employing techniques from the field of natural language processing to examine drug-related terms in a sample of tweets from the United States. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using distributed word-vector embeddings trained on social media data to uncover previously unknown (to researchers) drug terms. In this pilot study, we trained a continuous bag of words (CBOW) model of distributed word-vector embeddings on a Twitter dataset collected during July 2016 (roughly 884.2 million tokens). We queried the trained word embeddings for terms with high cosine similarity (a proxy for semantic relatedness) to well-known slang terms for marijuana to produce a list of candidate terms likely to function as slang terms for this substance. This candidate list was then compared with an expert-generated list of marijuana terms to assess the accuracy and efficacy of using word-vector embeddings to search for novel drug terminology. The method described here produced a list of 200 candidate terms for the target substance (marijuana). Of these 200 candidates, 115 were determined to in fact relate to marijuana (65 terms for the substance itself, 50 terms related to paraphernalia). This included 30 terms which were used to refer to the target substance in the corpus yet did not appear on the expert-generated list and were therefore considered to be successful cases of uncovering novel drug terminology. Several of these novel terms appear to have been introduced as recently as 1 or 2 months before the corpus time slice used to train the word embeddings. Though the precision of the method described here is low enough as to still necessitate human review of any candidate term lists generated in such a manner, the fact that this process was able to detect 30 novel terms for the target substance based only on one month's worth of Twitter data is highly promising. We see this pilot study as an important proof of concept and a first step toward producing a fully automated drug term discovery system capable of tracking emerging NPS terms in real time.",Cannabis;Dataset;Drug Users;Epidemiologists;Humans;Linguistics;Methods;Natural Language Processing;Needs;News;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Proxy;Public Health;Research Personnel;Review;Semantics;Social Media;Street Drugs;Substance Use;Surveys;Terminology;Time;Track;United States;Vocabulary,Substance Use,JMIR Public Health Surveill,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29380216,2018,Prediction Model for Two-Year Risk of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Prescribed Chronic Opioid Therapy.,"Naloxone is a life-saving opioid antagonist. Chronic pain guidelines recommend that physicians co-prescribe naloxone to patients at high risk for opioid overdose. However, clinical tools to efficiently identify patients who could benefit from naloxone are lacking. To develop and validate an overdose predictive model which could be used in primary care settings to assess the need for naloxone. Retrospective cohort. Derivation site was an integrated health system in Colorado; validation site was a safety-net health system in Colorado. We developed a predictive model in a cohort of 42,828 patients taking chronic opioid therapy and externally validated the model in 10,708 patients. Potential predictors and outcomes (nonfatal pharmaceutical and heroin overdoses) were extracted from electronic health records. Fatal overdose outcomes were identified from state vital records. To match the approximate shelf-life of naloxone, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to model the 2-year risk of overdose. Calibration and discrimination were assessed. A five-variable predictive model showed good calibration and discrimination (bootstrap-corrected c-statistic = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.78) in the derivation site, with sensitivity of 66.1% and specificity of 66.6%. In the validation site, the model showed good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.80) and less than ideal calibration, with sensitivity and specificity of 82.2% and 49.5%, respectively. Among patients on chronic opioid therapy, the predictive model identified 66-82% of all subsequent opioid overdoses. This model is an efficient screening tool to identify patients who could benefit from naloxone to prevent overdose deaths. Population differences across the two sites limited calibration in the validation site.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Calibration;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Colorado;Confidence Intervals;Death;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Overdose;Electronic Health Records;Female;Guideline;Health;Heroin;Humans;Life;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Occupational Health Physicians;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Primary Health Care;Prognosis;Records;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Safety;Savings;Screening;Sensitivity;Sensitivity and Specificity;Specificity;Statistics;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Chronic Pain;Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29462767,2018,Psychosocial and neural indicators of resilience among youth with a family history of substance use disorder.,"Little is known regarding the combined influence of psychosocial and neural protective mechanisms against substance use. The present study examined the extent to which neuroimaging measures of disinhibition predicted resilience against binge drinking and marijuana use among youth with a family history of substance use disorder (SUD; FH+), accounting for psychosocial measures of behavioral control. Participants were 57 FH+ youth from the Michigan Longitudinal Study categorized into resilient and high-risk groups based on patterns of weekly binge drinking and monthly marijuana use during early adulthood. Psychosocial measures of behavioral control (reactive control and externalizing behavior during early and late adolescence) and neural measures of disinhibition (Go/No-Go task and Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT) measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) were entered sequentially in hierarchical logistic regression models to predict resilient versus high-risk groups. Greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during correctly inhibited trials on the Go/No-Go task was a significant predictor of resilience (OR = 2.46, p &lt; 0.05), over and above greater reactive control in early adolescence (OR = 4.96, p &lt; 0.05) and lower externalizing behavior in late adolescence (OR = 0.64, p &lt; 0.05). Neural activation in the ventral striatum associated with reward anticipation during the MIDT was not a significant predictor of resilience. Brain function in the right DLPFC associated with inhibitory control may be a neural indicator of resilience against elevated substance use among FH+ youth, even after accounting for psychosocial measures of behavioral control.","Accounting;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Behavior;Behavior Control;Binge Drinking;Brain;Child;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Family;Female;History;Humans;Incentives;Indicators;Logistic Regression;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Marijuana Smoking;Marijuana Use;Measures;Michigan;Motivation;Neuroimaging;Neuropsychological Tests;Resilience, Psychological;Reward;Risk;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Ventral Striatum;Young Adult;Youth;fMRI",Binge Drinking;Marijuana Use;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
29966480,2020,Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants Among US High School Students to Help Study: Results From a National Survey.,"Mixed findings exist regarding extent and efficacy of nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NMUPS) for study enhancement (SE). This national study of US high school seniors examined NMUPS for SE and addressed risk/benefit questions: To what extent are students reporting NMUPS specifically for SE, and do these individuals demonstrate fewer problem behaviors and superior academic performance? Total of 15 098 US students surveyed (2009-2015) and divided into 4 subgroups: (1) no past-year NMUPS (nonusers), (2) past-year NMUPS to help study (NMUPS-SE only), (3) past-year NMUPS for study/nonstudy motives (NMUPS-SE+ other), and (4) past-year NMUPS for nonstudy motives (NMUPS-nonSE only). Student characteristics (eg, grade point average [GPA]) and substance-related problems (eg, binge drinking) compared between subgroups. Among students who reported past-year NMUPS (n = 781), 7.4% reported NMUPS-SE only, 40.9% NMUPS-SE+ other, and 51.7% NMUPS-nonSE only. Odds of binge drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana, and opioid nonmedical use significantly higher among all NMUPS subgroups. GPAs significantly lower among subgroups reporting NMUPS nonstudy motives; did not differ between NMUPS-SE only and nonusers. 7% of US high school seniors engaged in NMUPS for SE only (0.4% total population).

30481692,2019,A prospective study of nonmedical use of prescription opioids during adolescence and subsequent substance use disorder symptoms in early midlife.,"This longitudinal study assesses characteristics associated with adolescents' nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) including: frequency, co-ingestion, motives, specific opioid type; sequence of initiation of medical use of prescription opioids and NMUPO in relationship to subsequent substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms. Twenty-one independent national cohorts of U.S. high school seniors (n = 8,373) were surveyed and followed 17 years from adolescence to age 35. The majority of adolescents who engaged in NMUPO reported occasional/frequent NMUPO, non-pain relief motives for NMUPO, simultaneous co-ingestion involving NMUPO and other drugs, opioid analgesics with high misuse potential, and multiple types of opioid analgesics. Adolescents who reported NMUPO for pain relief, NMUPO involving opioid analgesics with high misuse potential, or multiple prescription opioids had significantly greater odds of SUD symptoms at age 35, relative to those who had no history of NMUPO during adolescence. In addition, medical use of prescription opioids after initiating NMUPO (or NMUPO only) during adolescence was associated with significantly greater odds of subsequent SUD symptoms at age 35 relative to those who reported the medical use of prescription opioids only or had no medical use or NMUPO during adolescence. This is the first U.S. national prospective study to examine the relationships between adolescents' NMUPO characteristics and later SUD symptoms in early midlife. Several characteristics (frequency, co-ingestion, motives, opioid type, and medical/NMUPO initiation history) were identified that could be used to screen and detect high-risk youth for indicated interventions to reduce prescription opioid misuse and SUDs.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Female;History;Humans;Ingestion;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Motivation;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Prospective Studies;Relatives;Risk;Schools;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30560232,2018,Novel Opioid Safety Clinic Initiative to Deliver Guideline-Concordant Chronic Opioid Therapy in Primary Care.,"To develop and evaluate a novel Opioid Safety Clinic (OSC) initiative to enhance adherence to guidelines on the assessment and monitoring of patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy (COT). The OSC was developed at an urban Federally Qualified Health Center to provide guideline-concordant care for COT, standardize workflows, and efficiently use clinic staff. We evaluated the OSC using a matched cohort study. Five hundred thirty-nine patients participated in the clinic between July 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. Of these, 472 clinic participants were matched to 472 nonparticipants by sex and age on the date of the OSC visit. The OSC was evaluated by its completion rates of standardized pain assessments, urine toxicology, and naloxone dispensings. We conducted logistic regression comparing OSC participants to OSC nonparticipants. A total of 539 patients attended an OSC visit, representing approximately 53% of patients in the chronic opioid registry. The OSC participants were more likely than nonparticipants to have completed a pain assessment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 169.8; 95% CI, 98.3-293.5), completed a urine toxicology (aOR, 46.1; 95% CI, 30.4-69.9), or had naloxone dispensed (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9-4.3) over 12 months of follow-up. The OSC model improved adherence to guideline-concordant COT in primary care.

Few studies have examined the association between abstinence from all substances and academic achievement. Data from a nationally representative sample of 9578 12th graders from the 2015 Monitoring the Future survey were analyzed to examine relationships between abstinence from substance use and 4 academic variables: skipping school, grades, academic self-efficacy, and emotional academic engagement. Participants were categorized as lifetime non-users, former users, and past-year users based on the use of 14 substances. Approximately one-fourth of participants had never used cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs during their lifetime, and 8%wt used at least one substance during their lifetime but not during the past year. Adjusting for demographic variables, past-year substance users had 2.71 greater odds of skipping school during the past month than lifetime non-users and 1.74 greater odds of having low grades. Lifetime non-users reported greater academic self-efficacy and emotional academic engagement than past-year users.

30926573,2019,Sources of Nonmedical Prescription Drug Misuse Among US High School Seniors: Differences in Motives and Substance Use Behaviors.,"To examine whether sources of nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) involving anxiolytics, opioids, and stimulants were associated with sociodemographic characteristics, NMUPD characteristics (eg, frequency), and other substance use. Nationally representative samples of US high school seniors (N = 18,549) were surveyed by self-administered questionnaires (2009-2016). Design-based latent class analysis and Rao-Scott χ2 tests were used to test associations among sociodemographic characteristics, NMUPD characteristics, other substance use behaviors (eg, binge drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use), and NMUPD sources. Approximately 11.0% of high school seniors reported past-year NMUPD (n = 1,917). A substantial proportion of nonmedical users obtained the prescription drugs from multiple sources (44.2%). Latent class analysis identified 5 subgroups of NMUPD sources (friend/relative sources, friend/purchased sources, own leftover prescription, multiple sources, and other sources). Nonmedical users who obtained prescription drugs from friend/purchased sources were more likely to be adolescent boys, whereas those who used their own leftover prescriptions were more likely to be adolescent girls. Nonmedical users who obtained prescription drugs from multiple sources were more involved in substance use. In contrast, adolescent nonmedical users who used their own leftover prescriptions were less involved in substance use. Growing evidence indicates that different NMUPD sources are associated with different substance use behaviors. All NMUPD sources should be discouraged, because they place individuals, families, and communities at risk. Patients and their families should receive education on how to manage and properly dispose of controlled medications to avoid diversion into the community. Prescribers are encouraged to check prescription monitoring programs and screen adolescents for substance use/misuse when prescribing controlled medications.","Adolescent;Adolescent Behavior;Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Anxiety Agents;Association;Behavior;Binge Drinking;Boys;Cigarette Smoking;Community;Cross-Sectional Studies;Education;Epidemiology;Family;Female;Friends;Humans;Latent Class Analysis;Male;Marijuana Use;Motivation;Opioids;Patients;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Program;Questionnaires;Relatives;Risk;Schools;Self;Students;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;Women",Binge Drinking;Marijuana Use;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
30933592,2019,The Affordable Care Act In The Heart Of The Opioid Crisis: Evidence From West Virginia.,"West Virginia is at the epicenter of a national opioid crisis, with a 2016 fatal opioid overdose rate of 43.4 per 100,000 population-more than triple the US average. We used claims data for 2014-16 to examine trends in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) among people enrolled in the West Virginia Medicaid expansion program under the Affordable Care Act. Expanding Medicaid could provide services to populations that may previously have had limited access to OUD treatment. We thus sought to understand trends over time in OUD diagnosis and treatment, especially with medications. About 5.5 percent of all enrollees were diagnosed with OUD per year, and the monthly prevalence of OUD diagnoses nearly tripled during this three-year period. The ratio of people filling buprenorphine to the number diagnosed with OUD was around one-third in early 2014, increasing to more than 75 percent by late 2016. Mean annual duration of filled buprenorphine increased from 161 days in 2014 to 185 days in 2016, and most people filling buprenorphine also received counseling and drug testing during the study period. The growing use of medication treatment for OUD in the West Virginia Medicaid expansion population provides an opportunity to reduce overdose deaths.","Buprenorphine;Counseling;Databases, Factual;Death;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Female;Heart;Humans;Insurance Claim Review;Male;Medicaid;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prevalence;Program;Retrospective Studies;Risk Assessment;Survival Analysis;Therapeutics;Time;United States;West Virginia",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Health Aff (Millwood),New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31058922,2019,Association Between State Laws Facilitating Pharmacy Distribution of Naloxone and Risk of Fatal Overdose.,"Given high rates of opioid-related fatal overdoses, improving naloxone access has become a priority. States have implemented different types of naloxone access laws (NALs) and there is controversy over which of these policies, if any, can curb overdose deaths. We hypothesize that NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists to provide naloxone will have the greatest potential for reducing fatal overdoses. To identify which types of NALs, if any, are associated with reductions in fatal overdoses involving opioids and examine possible implications for nonfatal overdoses. State-level changes in both fatal and nonfatal overdoses from 2005 to 2016 were examined across the 50 states and the District of Columbia after adoption of NALs using a difference-in-differences approach while estimating the magnitude of the association for each year relative to time of adoption. Policy environments across full state populations were represented in the primary data set. The association for 3 types of NALs was associated: NALs providing direct authority to pharmacists to prescribe, NALs providing indirect authority to prescribe, and other NALs. The study was conducted from January 2017 to January 2019. Fatal and nonfatal overdoses in states that adopted NAL laws were compared with those in states that did not adopt NAL laws. Further consideration was given to the type of NAL passed in terms of its association with these outcomes. We hypothesize that NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists to provide naloxone will have the greatest potential for reducing fatal overdoses. Fatal overdoses involving opioids were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal overdoses resulting in emergency department visits and Medicaid naloxone prescriptions. In this evaluation of the dispensing of naloxone across the United States, NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists were associated with significant reductions in fatal overdoses, but they may also increase nonfatal overdoses seen in emergency department visits. The effect sizes for fatal overdoses grew over time relative to adoption of the NALs. These policies were estimated to reduce opioid-rated fatal overdoses by 0.387 (95% CI, 0.119-0.656; P = .007) per 100 000 people in 3 or more years after adoption. There was little evidence of an association for indirect authority to dispense (increase by 0.121; 95% CI, -0.014 to 0.257; P = .09) and other NALs (increase by 0.094; 95% CI, -0.040 to 0.227; P = .17). Although many states have passed some type of law affecting naloxone availability, only laws allowing direct dispensing by pharmacists appear to be useful. Communities in which access to naloxone is improved should prepare for increases in nonfatal overdoses and link these individuals to effective treatment.","Adoption;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Community;Dataset;Death;District of Columbia;Drug Overdose;Drug and Narcotic Control;Emergency Service, Hospital;Environment;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Law;Male;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmacists;Pharmacy Distribution;Policy;Population;Prescriptions;Relatives;Risk;Risk Assessment;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31354012,2019,Adolescent and Parent Management of Controlled Prescription Medications.,"Background: Most adolescents who misuse controlled prescription medications acquire them from home settings. However, little is known regarding household management (storage, administration, and disposal) of these medications. Objective: To describe household management of controlled medications. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with paired data using brief, online, confidential surveys of adolescents and parents via an adolescent medicine clinic associated with a large academic center. Eligible adolescents were 12-18 years with at least one controlled prescription medication in the home. Six core safe management strategies for controlled medications were identified based on current recommendations. Data were collected and analyzed in 2017. Results: Of the 243 adolescent-parent dyads, 78.2% (n = 190) dyads store medication out of sight, 68.7% (n = 167) lock up medications, 78.2% (n = 190) do not store pills besides a school nurse's office or a parent's place of work, 43.6% (n = 106) provide periodic parental monitoring, 64.6% (n = 157) frequently dispose of unused controlled medications (at least every 3-4 months), and 80.2% (n = 195) dispose of controlled medications in a prescription drug take-back program or by flushing. Families with an adolescent prescription for a controlled medication were more likely to use several core management strategies (periodic parental monitoring, frequent disposal, and appropriate disposal location). Families with a household pain reliever were 8.7 times (95% CI 3.3, 23.3) as likely to not keep spare pills in inappropriate locations. Conclusions/Importance: Most families do not practice all recommended safe management strategies for controlled medications.

31393146,2020,"Capacity of juvenile probation officers in low-resourced, rural settings to deliver an evidence-based substance use intervention to adolescents.","Substance use is a major public health problem with a host of negative outcomes. Justice-involved youth have even higher risks and lack access to evidence-based interventions, particularly in rural communities. Task-shifting, or redistribution of tasks downstream to an existing workforce with less training, may be an innovative strategy to increase access to evidence-based interventions. Initial findings are presented from a services research trial conducted primarily in rural communities in which an existing workforce, juvenile probation/parole officers (JPOs), were randomized either to learn and deliver contingency management (CM) or to continue delivering probation services as usual (PAU). This study used the prevailing version of CM for adolescents, that is, family-based with behavior modification and cognitive behavioral components. Data included JPOs' self-reports, as well as audio-recorded youth/family sessions with JPOs rated by expert and trained observational coders. Data also included ratings from a comparison study in which therapists were trained and supervised by experts to deliver CM to justice-involved youth/families. Results showed JPOs can feasibly incorporate CM into their services. When adherence of CM JPOs was compared against CM therapists, JPOs delivered significantly more cognitive behavioral components of CM and similar levels of behavior modification components of CM. These findings suggest that JPOs can be leveraged to provide evidence-based substance use interventions like CM in similar, or even greater, capacities to clinically trained therapists. This task-shifting approach could dramatically expand service access for these high-risk youth, particularly in rural areas where substance use services are limited or nonexistent.

31521577,2019,Trajectories of prescription drug misuse during the transition from late adolescence into adulthood in the USA: a national longitudinal multicohort study.,"Prescription drug misuse is most prevalent during young adulthood (ages 18-25 years). We aimed to identify prescription drug misuse trajectories for three drug classes (opioids, stimulants, and sedatives or tranquilisers) from adolescence into adulthood, assess the extent to which different trajectories are associated with symptoms of substance use disorder, and identity factors associated with high-risk prescription drug misuse trajectories. For this longitudinal multicohort study, nationally representative probability samples of 51 223 adolescents in the USA were followed up across eight waves from age 18 years (cohorts 1976-96) to age 35 years. Data were collected via self-administered paper questionnaires. Five prescription drug misuse trajectories were identified and the defining characteristic that differentiated the five trajectories was the age when past-year prescription drug misuse high frequency peaked: rare or no misuse at any age, peak at age 18 years, peak at ages 19-20 years, peak at age 23-24 years, and peak at ages 27-28 years. Similar prescription drug misuse trajectories were identified for each prescription drug class. The later peak misuse trajectory for sedatives and tranquilisers crested at an older age (35 years) than that for the other drug classes. Prescription drug misuse trajectories were all associated with significantly greater odds of having two or more substance use disorder symptoms at age 35 years, especially the later peak trajectories. In controlled analyses, risk factors associated with the high-risk latest peak prescription drug misuse trajectory included high school heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, poly-prescription drug misuse, white race, and not completing a 4-year university degree. Prescription drug misuse trajectories are heterogeneous, and any high-frequency prescription drug misuse is a strong risk factor for development of substance use disorders during adulthood, especially later-peak prescription drug misuse trajectories. These findings might help practitioners identify individuals at greatest risk for substance use disorders and target intervention strategies.

31722022,2019,Association of Punitive and Reporting State Policies Related to Substance Use in Pregnancy With Rates of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.,"Despite the rapidly changing policy environment regarding substance use during pregnancy, information is lacking on the association of state policies with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). To determine if punitive or reporting state policies related to substance use during pregnancy are associated with NAS rates. This repeated cross-sectional study used retrospective, difference-in-difference analysis of live births in the State Inpatient Databases from 8 US states in varying years between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014. States without punitive or reporting policies were compared with states with policies before and after policy enactment using logistic regression models adjusted for individual and county-level factors and state and year fixed effects. Analyses were conducted from April 10, 2019, to July 30, 2019. Time since enactment of state policies related to substance use in pregnancy, county-level rurality and unemployment, and presence of specialized treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women in a county. Rates of NAS. Among 4 567 963 live births, 23 377 neonates (0.5%) received a diagnosis of NAS. Among neonates with NAS, 3394 (14.5%) lived in counties without any treatment programs specifically for pregnant and postpartum women, 20 323 (86.9%) lived in metropolitan counties, and 8135 (34.8%) lived in counties in the highest unemployment quartile. In adjusted analyses among neonates in states with punitive policies, odds of NAS were significantly greater during the first full calendar year after enactment (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46; P = .007) and more than 1 full year after enactment (adjusted odds ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.51; P &lt; .001). After regression adjustment, the annual NAS rate was 46 (95% CI, 43-48) neonates with NAS per 10 000 live births in states without punitive policies; 57 (95% CI, 48-65) neonates with NAS per 10 000 live births in states with punitive policies during the first full year after enactment; and 60 (95% CI, 56-65) neonates with NAS per 10 000 live births in states with punitive policies in effect for more than 1 full year. There was no association between reporting policies and odds of NAS. In this repeated cross-sectional analysis of 8 states, states with punitive policies were associated with greater odds of NAS immediately and in the longer term, but there was no association between NAS and states with reporting policies.","Adjustment;Association;Calendar;Criminal Law;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis;Environment;Female;Health Policy;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Inpatients;Live Birth;Logistic Regression;Male;Mandatory Reporting;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Odds Ratio;Policy;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Program;Retrospective Studies;State Government;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Unemployment;United States",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31941823,2020,The great decline in adolescent cigarette smoking since 2000: consequences for drug use among US adolescents.,"Adolescent cigarette smoking declined steadily and substantially from 2000 to 2018. This paper considers the potential consequences of this 'great decline' for the prevalence of other drug use among adolescents. Data are annual, cross-sectional, nationally representative Monitoring the Future surveys of more than 1.2 million US students in 12th, 10th and 8th grades from 2000 to 2018. Analyses include trends in the past 12 months' non-medical amphetamine, tranquillisers and opioid use overall, among ever and never cigarette smokers, and projected if adolescent cigarette smoking levels had remained at 2000 levels. Within groups of ever and never cigarette smokers, the prevalence for each of the three substances has either changed little or overall increased in 2018 as compared with 2000. When the two groups were combined into one pool, the overall prevalence for each of the drugs declined by about half. The decline resulted from the growing group of never smokers, whose levels of non-medical drug use over the study period were at least four times lower than the levels of ever smokers. The results support the 'gateway' prediction that declines in cigarette smoking among adolescents pull downward their non-medical use of amphetamines, tranquillisers and opioids. Continuing to reduce adolescent smoking through policy and programmatic prevention efforts should have further positive spillover effects on adolescent drug use.",Adolescent;Amphetamine;Cigarette Smoking;Cigarettes;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems;Future;Harm Reduction;Humans;Opioids;Overall;Paper;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Public Policy;Smokers;Smoking;Students;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time,,Tob Control,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
31962289,2020,Contextual risk among adolescents receiving opioid prescriptions for acute pain in pediatric ambulatory care settings.,"Many adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) report that their first exposure to opioids was in the course of routine pain treatment in medical care settings. Adolescents receive opioid prescriptions with frequency, but are susceptible to a constellation of unique risks in the context of pain management. This empirical study presents the first cohort of adolescents recruited from ambulatory medical care within 72 h of their receipt of opioids to treat acute pain. The primary aim was to capture a time-sensitive report of the intersection of prescription opioid receipt and contextual risks for opioid misuse related to pain experience, mental health symptoms, and substance use at the adolescent and parental levels. Data were collected from 70 14-19-year-old adolescents and their accompanying parent. Results reflected that 90% of this sample of adolescents reported 2 or more risks and 35% reported 5 or more risks for future opioid misuse. Pain catastrophizing (46%) and alcohol use (40%) and were the most common adolescent-level risk factors; mother history of chronic pain (32%) and parent anxiety (21%) were the most common parent-level risk factors. Past-week parent pain intensity showed the strongest association with adolescent past-week pain intensity; neither was associated with adolescent OUD symptoms. Adolescent pain catastrophizing most reliably predicted OUD symptoms; parent pain interference was also associated. Seventy-one percent of parents reported keeping opioids at home, a relevant risk factor for future misuse. These findings illuminate the intersection between adolescent and parental risks in the context of pediatric opioid prescribing for acute pain management, and provide initial insight into potential points of prevention early in adolescent pain treatment, including avenues by which to inform and enhance prescriber decision-making regarding factors to be weighed in adolescent candidacy for opioid therapy.","Acute Pain;Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Association;Chronic Pain;Decision Making;Family;Family Characteristics;Female;Future;History;Humans;Male;Mental Health;Mothers;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Management;Parents;Pediatrics;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Report;Risk;Risk Factors;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time;Young Adult",Acute Pain;Chronic Pain;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use,Addict Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32058248,2020,Legal requirements and recommendations to prescribe naloxone.,"The continued toll of opioid-related overdoses has motivated efforts to expand availability of naloxone to persons at high risk of overdose, with 2016 federal guidance encouraging clinicians to co-prescribe naloxone to patients with increased overdose risk. Some states have pursued analogous or stricter legal requirements that could more heavily influence prescriber behavior. We conducted a systematic legal review of state laws that mandate or recommend that healthcare providers prescribe naloxone to patients with indicators for opioid overdose risk. We coded relevant statutes and regulations for: applicable populations, patient criteria, educational requirements, and exemptions. As of September 2019, 17 states had enacted naloxone co-prescribing laws, the earliest of which was implemented by Louisiana in January 2016. If patient overdose risk criteria are met, over half of these states mandate that providers prescribe naloxone (7 states, 41.1 %) or offer a naloxone prescription (2 states, 11.8 %); the remainder encourage prescribers to consider prescribing naloxone (8 states). Most states (58.8 %) define patient overdose risk based on opioid dosages prescribed, although the threshold varies substantially; other common overdose risk criteria include concomitant opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions and patient history of substance use disorder or mental illness. A growing minority of states has adopted a naloxone prescribing law, although these policies remain less prevalent than other naloxone access laws. By targeting higher-risk patients during clinical encounters, naloxone prescribing requirements could increase naloxone prescribed, destigmatize naloxone use, and reduce overdose harms. Further investigation into policy effectiveness, unintended consequences, and appropriate parameters is warranted.","Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Benzodiazepine;Classification;Databases, Factual;Drug Overdose;Drug Prescriptions;Female;Harm Reduction;Health Personnel;History;Humans;Indicators;Law;Legislation, Drug;Louisiana;Male;Mental Disorders;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Policy;Population;Prescriptions;Regulation;Review;Risk;Substance Use Disorders;United States",Drug Overdose;Mental Disorders;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32193022,2020,How increasing medical access to opioids contributes to the opioid epidemic: Evidence from Medicare Part D.,"Drug overdoses involving opioid analgesics have increased dramatically since 1999, representing one of the United States' top public health crises. Opioids have legitimate medical functions, but they are often diverted, suggesting a tradeoff between improving medical access and nonmedical abuse. We provide causal estimates of the relationship between the medical opioid supply and drug overdoses using Medicare Part D as a differential shock to the geographic distribution of opioids. Our estimates imply that a 10% increase in opioid medical supply leads to a 7.1% increase in opioid-related deaths among the Medicare-ineligible population, suggesting substantial diversion from medical markets.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Humans;Lead;Medicare;Medicare Part D;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioids;Population;Public Health;Shock;Supplies;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Shock,J Health Econ,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32199545,2020,Opioid overdose and inpatient care for substance use disorder care in Massachusetts.,"Inpatient treatment for substance use disorders is a collection of strategies ranging from short term detoxification to longer term residential treatment. How those with opioid use disorder (OUD) navigate this inpatient treatment system after an encounter for detoxification and subsequent risk of opioid-related overdose is not well understood. We used a comprehensive Massachusetts database to characterize the movement of people with OUD through inpatient care from 2013 to 2015, identifying admissions to inpatient detoxification, subsequent inpatient care, and opioid overdose while navigating treatment. We measured the person-years accumulated during each transition period to calculate rates of opioid-related overdose, and investigated how overdose differed in select populations. Sixty-one percent of inpatient detoxification admissions resulted in a subsequent inpatient detoxification admission without progressing to further inpatient care. Overall, there were 287 fatal and 7337 non-fatal overdoses. Persons exiting treatment after detoxification had the greatest risk of overdose (17.3 per 100 person-years) compared to those who exited after subsequent inpatient care (ranging from 5.9 to 6.6 overdoses per 100 person-years). Non-Hispanic whites were most at risk for opioid related overdose with 16 overdoses per 100 person-years and non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest risk with 5 overdoses per 100 person-years. The majority of inpatient detoxification admissions do not progress to further inpatient care. Recurrent inpatient detoxification admission is common, likely signifying relapse. Rather than functioning as the first step to inpatient care, inpatient detoxification might be more effective as a venue for implementing strategies to expand addiction services or treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder.","Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Collection;Database;Drug Overdose;Hispanics;Humans;Inpatients;Massachusetts;Movement;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Persons;Population;Relapse;Residential Treatment;Risk;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Whites",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Guidelines for best practice in caring for pregnant women with opioid use disorder suggest the use of medication-assisted treatment with additional comprehensive care, including behavioral and mental health interventions. However, intervention research often mutually excludes these two populations, with studies of behavioral interventions for opioid use excluding women with psychopathology and research on preventive interventions for postpartum psychopathology excluding women who are substance using. There is a limited evidence-base to inform the selection of appropriate preventive interventions for pregnant women with opioid use disorder that can address opioid use and/or treatment adherence and concurrent mental health risks. We argue it is critical to integrate research on pregnant women who are opioid using and preventive perinatal mental health interventions to catalyze pivotal change in how we address the opioid epidemic within this growing population.",Address;Best Practices;Caring;Catalysis;Guideline;Mental Health;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Population;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Psychopathology;Research;Review;Risk;Therapeutics;Treatment Adherence;Women,Opioid Use Disorder,Curr Addict Rep,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Hospitalists care for most hospitalized patients in the United States, yet little is known about their attitudes, beliefs, and clinical practices regarding OUD-related care. Methods: We distributed an online survey to hospitalists in the United States to measure how access to addiction specialists affected attitudes and beliefs regarding hospital-based OUD care, OUD screening practices, naloxone prescribing, and buprenorphine initiation. Results: Among 262 respondents, 67.9% (n = 178) reported having access to addiction specialists. While 84.5% (n = 221) reported often or always caring for patients with OUD, 48.2% (n = 126) rarely or never screened for OUD, 57.1% (n = 149) rarely or never prescribed or recommended naloxone as harm reduction, and 88.9% (n = 233) rarely or never initiated buprenorphine.

32359041,2020,The Long-Term Associations Between Direct and Threatened Physical Violence in Adolescence and Symptoms of Substance Use Disorders During the Mid-30s.,"Most studies linking physical victimization and substance use have focused on concurrent or temporally proximal associations, making it unclear whether physical victimization has a sustained impact on substance use problems. We examined the long-term associations between adolescent physical victimization and symptoms of substance use disorders in adulthood, controlling for intermediating victimization during young adulthood and several control variables. Data were obtained from the Monitoring the Future Study (N = 5,291). Women and men were recruited around age 18 and surveyed biennially through age 30, and again at 35. Past-year physical victimization (threatened physical assaults, injurious assaults) was measured regularly from age 18 to 30. Alcohol and cannabis use symptoms (e.g., withdrawal, tolerance) were assessed at age 35. Controls were measured in adolescence (e.g., prior substance use) and young adulthood (e.g., marriage). Interactions examined whether associations varied by sex. When we controlled for adolescent substance use, adolescents who were threatened with injury or who sustained physical injuries as a result of violence had more alcohol use symptoms at age 35 than nonvictims. However, when victimization during young adulthood was statistically accounted for, only victimization during young adulthood was associated with age-35 alcohol use symptoms. The effects of young adult victimization, but not adolescent victimization, were stronger for women. Victimization was mostly unrelated to age-35 cannabis use symptoms. Adolescents who are threatened with physical assaults or injured by physical assaults have significantly more alcohol use symptoms in their mid-30s than nonvictimized adolescents, but these associations are completely explained by subsequent victimization during young adulthood.",Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent Behavior;Adult;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Association;Cannabis;Crime Victims;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Future;Humans;Injuries;Male;Marijuana Abuse;Marriage;Men;Physical Abuse;Sex;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time Factors;Victimization;Violence;Women;Young Adult,Alcoholism;Injuries;Marijuana Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Stud Alcohol Drugs,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32540516,2020,Factors associated with state legislators' support for opioid use disorder parity laws.,"In the United States, state behavioral health parity laws play a crucial role in ensuring equitable insurance coverage and access to substance use disorder treatment and services for people that need them. State legislators have the exclusive authority to adopt these laws. The purpose of this study was to identify legislator beliefs independently associated with ""strong support"" for opioid use disorder (OUD) parity. Data were from a 2017 cross-sectional, state-stratified, multi-modal survey of state legislators (N = 475). The dependent variable was ""strong support"" for OUD parity. Primary independent variables were beliefs about state parity laws. Bivariate analyses and mixed effects logistic regression were conducted. Legislators who ""strongly supported"" OUD parity were significantly more likely than legislators who did not ""strongly support"" OUD parity to be female (64.1% vs. 46.5%, p&lt;.001) , Democrat (76.2% vs. 29.3%, p&lt;.001), and have liberal, compared to conservative, ideology (85.6% vs. 27.1%, p&lt;.001).

These state legislators' beliefs were more strongly associated with ""strong support"" for OUD parity than political party, ideology, and other demographic and state-level characteristics. Dissemination materials and communication strategies to cultivate support for OUD parity laws among state legislators should focus on the fiscal impacts of parity laws and the effectiveness of substance use disorder treatments.","Beliefs;Communication;Cost;Cross-Sectional Studies;Demography;Female;Health;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Insurance, Health;Law;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Parity;Persons;Play;Politics;Role;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32652376,2020,The state of the science in opioid policy research.,"Characterize the state of the science in opioid policy research based on a literature review of opioid policy studies. We conducted a scoping review of studies evaluating the impact of U.S. state-level and federal-level policies on opioid-related outcomes published in 2005-2018. We characterized: 1) state and federal policies evaluated, 2) opioid-related outcomes examined, and 3) study design and analytic methods (summarized overall and by policy category). In total, 145 studies were reviewed (79 % state-level policies, 21 % federal-level policies) and classified with respect to 8 distinct policy categories and 7 outcome categories. The majority of studies evaluated policies related to prescription opioids (prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), opioid prescribing policies, federal regulation of prescription opioids, pain clinic laws) and considered policy impacts with respect to proximal outcomes (e.g., opioid prescribing behaviors). In total, only 29 (20 % of studies) met each of three key criteria for rigorous design: analysis of longitudinal data with a comparison group design, adjustment for difference between policy-enacting and comparison states, and adjustment for potentially confounding co-occurring policies. These more rigorous studies were predominately published in 2017-2018 and primarily evaluated PDMPs, marijuana laws, treatment-related policies, and overdose prevention policies. Our results indicated that study design rigor varied notably across policy categories, highlighting the need for broader adoption of rigorous methods in the opioid policy field. More evaluation studies are needed regarding overdose prevention policies and policies related to treatment access. Greater examination of distal outcomes and potential unintended consequences are also warranted.","Adjustment;Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Cannabis;Drug Overdose;Evaluation Study;Female;Health Policy;Humans;Law;Literature;Methods;Needs;Opioids;Overall;Pain Clinics;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Regulation;Research;Respect;Review;Science;Therapeutics",Drug Overdose;Pain,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32692425,2021,Adolescent cannabis and tobacco use are associated with opioid use in young adulthood-12-year longitudinal study in an urban cohort.,"Cannabis, tobacco and alcohol use are prevalent among youth in the United States and may be risk factors for opioid use. The current study aimed at investigating associations between developmental trajectories of cannabis, tobacco and alcohol use in adolescence and opioid use in young adulthood in an urban cohort over the span of 12 years. Cohort study of adolescents originally recruited for a randomized prevention trial with yearly assessments into young adulthood. Nine urban elementary schools in Baltimore, MD in the United States. Participants (n = 583, 86.8% African American, 54.7% male) were originally recruited as first grade students. Cannabis, tobacco and alcohol use were assessed annually from ages 14-18 years and opioid use from ages 19-26. Socio-demographics were assessed at age 6. Intervention status was also randomly assigned at age 6. Gender, race, free/reduced-priced lunch and intervention status were included as covariates in individual and sequential growth models. There were significant positive associations between the cannabis use intercept at age 14 and the opioid use intercept at age 19 (beta = 1.43; P = 0.028), the tobacco use intercept at age 14 and the opioid use intercept at age 19 (beta = 0.82; P = 0.042). Specifically, more frequent use of cannabis or tobacco at age 14 was associated with more frequent use of opioids at age 19. Cannabis and tobacco use in early adolescence may be risk factors for opioid use in young adulthood among African Americans living in urban areas.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Baltimore;Cannabis;Cohort Studies;Demography;Female;Gender;Growth;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Lunch;Male;Opioids;Racial Stocks;Risk Factors;Schools;Students;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;United States;Young Adult;Youth",,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32717502,2020,"Predictors of Opioid Misuse During Emerging Adulthood: An Examination of Adolescent Individual, Family and Peer Factors.","Opioid misuse has reached epidemic proportions among emerging adults in the U.S. To inform prevention efforts, this study examined adolescent factors related to alcohol and marijuana (AM) use that are associated with a higher or lower risk for opioid misuse during emerging adulthood. We used 11 waves of survey data from a diverse California cohort (N = 6,509). Predictor variables from waves 1-7 (ages 11-17) included individual (resistance self-efficacy, positive expectancies) family (older sibling and important adult use), and peer (perceived norms, time spent with peers who use, peer approval) factors. Opioid misuse at wave 8 (mean age = 18.3) and wave 11 (mean age = 21.6) included heroin and nonmedical prescription drug use. Initial latent growth models (LGMs) indicated that nearly all intercepts and slopes for individual, family, and peer AM factors predicted opioid misuse at waves 8 and 11. These associations were reduced to non-significance after adjusting for prior other substance use with the exception of three intercepts: positive expectancies, peer approval, and older sibling use predicted a higher probability of opioid misuse at wave 8. Stronger AM positive expectancies, perceived peer approval of AM use, and older sibling AM use during adolescence are associated with a higher likelihood of opioid misuse during the transition to emerging adulthood. However, most adolescent factors were no longer associated with subsequent opioid misuse after adjusting for history of other substance use, highlighting the importance of considering the larger context of substance use in studies of opioid misuse among young people.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent Behavior;Adult;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;California;Cannabis;Child;Cognition;Epidemics;Family;Female;Growth;Heroin;History;Humans;Male;Marijuana Abuse;Marijuana Smoking;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Peer Group;Persons;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Probability;Risk;Self Efficacy;Siblings;Substance Use;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time;Young Adult",Marijuana Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32745836,2020,Trajectories of cannabis use and risk for opioid misuse in a young adult urban cohort.,"Although much of the attention surrounding the opioid epidemic has focused on rural and suburban Whites and prescription opioids, heroin overdoses among urban Blacks are on the rise. While some argue that legalization of cannabis will combat the epidemic, there are concerns it ignores the shift in the epidemic and could increase vulnerability to opioid misuse. The goal of this study is to examine the association between cannabis use from adolescence to young adulthood with opioid misuse in a primarily urban Black cohort. Data are from a study of 580 youth (87 % Black and 71 % low SES) residing in Baltimore City followed from ages 6-26. Cannabis trajectories were identified between ages 14-26 using group-based trajectory modeling. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine the impact of trajectories on opioid misuse in young adulthood adjusting for individual, neighborhood and peer factors. Opioid misuse was defined as using heroin or narcotics or painkillers without a prescription between ages 19-26. Four cannabis trajectories were identified: Low/Non-Users (59.7 %), Adolescent Onset Limited (19.5 %), Young Adult Onset (10.8 %), and Adolescent Onset Chronic (10.0 %). Adolescent Onset Chronic cannabis users had the highest rate of opioid misuse (44.8 %) followed by Adolescent Onset Limited (18.8 %), Young Adult Onset (14.8 %) and Low/Non-Users (8.3 %). Prevalences were significantly higher for Adolescent Onset groups relative to Low/Non-Users even after adjustment for individual, neighborhood and peer factors. Adolescent onset cannabis use is associated with opioid misuse in young adulthood among urban Blacks even after adjustment for socioecological factors associated with opioid misuse.","Adjustment;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Attention;Baltimore;Blacks;Cannabis;Child;Cities;Cohort Studies;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Female;Goals;Heroin;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Marijuana Smoking;Motivation;Narcotics;Neighborhood;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Peer Group;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Relatives;Residence Characteristics;Risk;Whites;Young Adult;Youth",Drug Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32818294,2021,Effects of homophobic name-calling and verbal sexual harassment on substance use among young adults.,"Verbal aggression victimization, such as homophobic name-calling, has been linked to heavier substance use among young people, but little longitudinal research has examined how different types of victimization may affect substance use or whether certain psychosocial factors moderate these risks. In a diverse cohort (N  = 2,663), latent transition analysis was used to model heterogeneity in victimization (age 19) and substance use (age 20). Four victimization (high victimization, homophobic name-calling only, verbal sexual harassment only, and low victimization) and three substance use (poly-substance use, alcohol, and cannabis only, low all) classes were identified. The high victimization and homophobic name-calling only classes had the highest probabilities of transitioning into the poly-substance use class, and the high victimization class had the highest probability of transitioning into the alcohol and cannabis only class. The probability of transitioning into the low all substance use class was highest in the low victimization class and lowest in the high victimization class. For the high victimization class, greater depressive symptoms increased the odds, and better peer relationship quality decreased the odds, of transitioning into the poly-substance use and alcohol and cannabis only classes. For the homophobic name-calling only class, greater depressive symptoms increased the odds of transitioning into the poly-substance use class. Homophobic name-calling, alone or in combination with verbal sexual harassment, is a risk factor for escalating substance use in young adulthood, especially among victims with depressive symptoms.",Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Aggression;Alcohols;Bullying;Cannabis;Crime Victims;Depressive Symptoms;Humans;Names;Peer Group;Persons;Probability;Psychosocial Factors;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Sexual Harassment;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Victimization;Young Adult,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Aggress Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

In this study, we examine school-level prevalence and correlates of medical use and misuse of prescription opioids among US 12th-grade students. A sample of 228 507 US 12th-graders in 1079 public and private schools from 2002 to 2017 from the Monitoring the Future study was used to identify school-level prevalence and correlates associated with medical use and misuse of prescription opioids. The past-year prevalence of prescription opioid misuse was 7.6% and ranged from 0% to 73% across US high schools. Lifetime medical use of prescription opioids was 16.9% and ranged from 0% to 85% across US high schools. The odds of prescription opioid misuse were higher at schools with higher proportions of male students, more white students, higher rates of marijuana use, and more medical use of prescription opioids. Students attending schools with the highest rates of medical use of prescription opioids had 57% increased odds of past-year prescription opioid misuse compared with schools with no medical use (adjusted odds ratio = 1.57, 95% confidence interval = 1.35-1.83); this association was found to weaken in recent years. Differences exist in the prevalence of prescription opioid misuse among US high schools. The association between greater school-level medical use of prescription opioids and higher prevalence of prescription opioid misuse, although declining, indicates a key risk factor to target for prevention efforts.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Confidence Intervals;Female;Future;Humans;Male;Marijuana Abuse;Marijuana Use;Odds Ratio;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Public Health;Risk Factors;Schools;Sex Factors;Students;United States;Whites;Youth",Marijuana Abuse;Marijuana Use;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Pediatrics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32915020,2020,Patterns of opioid use in adolescents receiving prescriptions: The role of psychological and pain factors.,"In the United States, adolescents are routinely prescribed opioids for management of pain. Data suggest that early opioid use, even via a legitimate prescription, can increase risk for opioid misuse. There are surprisingly little data on the nature of pain medication prescribing within pediatric medical settings and adolescent outcomes despite this being the place most youth are introduced to prescription opioids. To address this gap, the current study recruited n = 139 adolescents ages 14-18 years who were prescribed opioid medications for acute noncancer pain in pediatric outpatient medical settings. Data on opioid use and mood symptoms were obtained via daily diaries and self-report measures. The majority of youth (90.9%) filled the opioid prescription, and of those who used those opioids, the frequency of use varied widely (10-100% of days). There were no gender differences in the percent of opioid use days, despite females reporting higher pain and mood symptoms than males. Greater pain experiences and the number of pills prescribed were positively associated with opioid use as reported in daily diaries. As hypothesized, higher depressive symptoms were associated with greater opioid use. Higher daily reports of worried or scared affect were associated with lower opioid use. Findings contribute to our understanding of adolescent opioid use following prescription in a pediatric outpatient medical setting.

32991383,2021,Pills to Powder: A 17-Year Transition From Prescription Opioids to Heroin Among US Adolescents Followed Into Adulthood.,"To examine the longitudinal relationships between US adolescents' prescription opioid use and misuse and any subsequent heroin use in adulthood. Nationally representative samples of adolescents from 25 independent cohorts were surveyed via self-administered questionnaires and followed from ages 18 to 35 (n = 11,012). Adolescents were divided into 5 subgroups based on survey responses at age 18: no lifetime exposure to prescription opioids (population controls), medical prescription opioid use without a history of nonmedical misuse (medical use only), medical use followed by nonmedical misuse, nonmedical misuse followed by medical use, and nonmedical misuse only. These 5 subgroups were compared on their risk for any heroin use through age 35 (1993-2017). Adolescents who reported lifetime heroin use at age 18 were excluded. Adolescents who reported nonmedical prescription opioid misuse followed by medical use or nonmedical misuse only had greater odds of any heroin use in adulthood than population controls. More recent cohorts of adolescents who reported nonmedical misuse or medical use only (compared to older cohorts) had greater odds of any heroin use in adulthood relative to population controls. Nearly 1 in 3 adolescents in recent cohorts who reported nonmedical prescription opioid misuse transitioned to any heroin use. There is increased risk for heroin use among adolescents who initiated nonmedical misuse or adolescents prescribed opioids in more recent cohorts. These findings indicate historical variation and reinforce the critical role of vigilant monitoring and drug screening to detect high-risk individuals who would benefit from an intervention to reduce later heroin use.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Heroin;History;Humans;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Population Control;Powders;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Questionnaires;Relatives;Risk;Role;Self;Surveys;United States;Young Adult",Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33089133,2020,Consensus Guidelines and State Policies: The Gap Between Principle and Practice at the Intersection of Substance Use and Pregnancy.,"The opioid crisis has had a substantial effect on women who are pregnant and parenting, focusing both public health and policymaker attention on opioids and on other substance use in pregnancy and postpartum. There is overwhelming consensus on the principle of a non-punitive approach towards substance use in pregnancy. Experts universally endorse supportive policies, which reduce barriers to care, and oppose punitive policies, which can increase the fear of legal penalties, discouraging women from seeking prenatal care and addiction treatment during pregnancy. We review the change over time in state-level policy environments around substance use in pregnancy and contrast the policy response with the principles and guidance from professional societies and federal agencies. Between 2000 and 2015, more states adopted punitive policies than supportive policies, in direct contrast with guidance from professional societies and federal agencies. The increase in punitive policies over the past two decades suggests that the gap between principles and practice is widening. Furthermore, the increase in punitive policies is occurring in the context of significant structural barriers to comprehensive health care across the woman's entire life course, a growing awareness of racial and ethnic inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality, and increasing restrictions at the state level on abortion access. Women with substance use disorder (SUD) need comprehensive, coordinated, evidence-based, trauma-informed, family-centered care. This care should be delivered in a compassionate and non-punitive environment, and clinicians, policymakers, and public health officials all have a role to play in achieving this goal.","Analgesics, Opioid;Attention;Awareness;Comprehensive Health Care;Consensus;Environment;Family;Fear;Female;Goals;Guideline;Humans;Life;Morbidity;Mortality;Needs;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Parenting;Play;Policy;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Prenatal Care;Public Health;Review;Role;Societies;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Women;Wounds and Injuries",Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries,Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

33234360,2021,How do high school seniors get marijuana? Prevalence and sociodemographic differences.,"Efforts to understand how adolescents acquire marijuana will help to contextualize its use among youth. Little is known about ways of getting marijuana and how they differ between subgroups of adolescents. The present study sought to determine how adolescents get marijuana and if modes of access vary by sociodemographic characteristics. Data were from the nationally representative Monitoring the Future study of 12th graders in the United States from 2012 to 2018 (N = 4262 students). Participants used marijuana in the past 12 months and were asked how they got marijuana. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict modes of getting marijuana based on sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, parental education, and survey year. Cross-tabulation analyses compared how recent frequent and non-frequent use related to ways of getting marijuana. The most endorsed methods of getting marijuana were given for free by friends, bought from friends, and bought from a drug dealer/stranger. Differences by sociodemographic subgroup and recent frequent use emerged, including for riskier modes of obtainment such as buying from a drug dealer/stranger (for male students, urban students, and recent frequent users). Recent frequent users were more likely to endorse getting marijuana by nearly each method, except non-frequent users were more likely to be given marijuana for free by friends. Understanding the prevalence of different modes of getting marijuana among adolescents and which subgroups are most susceptible to riskier means of getting marijuana will allow drug use prevention efforts to be tailored appropriately so as to maximize effectiveness.",Adolescent;Cannabis;Comprehension;Education;Ethnic Groups;Friends;Future;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Marijuana Smoking;Methods;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Racial Stocks;Schools;Sex;Students;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;United States;Youth,Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

We examined the association of opioid misuse from ages 18 to 20 with four domains at age 21-22: risk behaviors and consequences; health; social functioning; and emerging adult roles. Participants were surveyed annually from 2008 through 2019. The sample includes N = 2880 youth from waves 8-11. The sample was approximately 18 years old at wave 8; 54% female, 46% Hispanic, 20% white, 20% Asian, 2% Black, and 11% multiracial. Opioid misuse was low in this general sample of young adults, with about 4% reporting misuse from age 18-20. We used latent growth curve modeling to examine how misuse from ages 18-20 was associated with functioning at age 21-22. Adolescents who reported opioid misuse at age 18 also reported more negative consequences from alcohol and cannabis use and greater odds of other prescription drug misuse at age 21-22 than those with no misuse. Those reporting opioid misuse at age 18 were also more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviors, report delinquent behavior, and have a higher likelihood of experiencing sexual victimization and engaging in sexual perpetration at age 21-22 than those with no misuse. Neither the intercept nor slope of opioid misuse was associated with depression, anxiety, physical health or ailments, satisfaction with friends, romantic relationship functioning, or emerging adult roles at wave 11.

33298307,2021,Juvenile probation officers' perceptions on youth substance use varies from task-shifting to family-based contingency management.,"The majority of justice-involved youth have problems with substance use, but juvenile justice agencies face numerous barriers to providing evidence-based treatments for these youth. Task-shifting is one strategy for increasing access to such treatments. That is, training juvenile probation officers (JPOs) to deliver substance use treatments, such as contingency management (CM) could improve youths' motivation and behavioral outcomes. However, probation traditionally emphasizes sanctions over incentives, so JPOs must alter their perspectives to accept protocols such as CM for substance use. Using mixed focus group and survey methods at baseline and one year later, this randomized study examined heretofore unstudied JPO perceptions during a task-shifting experiment in which JPOs were asked to start delivering CM for youth substance use, compared to a control group of JPOs who did not change their practices. At baseline, JPOs expressed a perception of hopelessness about their work with substance-using youth and their parents, but they generally held positive views toward use of tangible incentives. One year after randomization to participate in CM training and delivery, JPO perceptions changed positively about working with youth and their parents, substance use programs and resources, and whether they believed tangible incentive programs were worthwhile. Over the same time, there was a perceptual stasis in hopelessness for JPOs randomized to deliver probation services as usual, and there was degradation in their previously positive perception toward tangible incentives. The study advances thinking regarding tools that JPOs can use for working with youth and families and the role that task-shifting can play in both increasing access to evidence-based treatments and improving attitudinal outcomes of JPOs.",Adolescent;Behavior Therapy;Control Groups;Face;Family;Focus Groups;Humans;Incentives;Justice;Juvenile Delinquency;Methods;Motivation;Parents;Perception;Play;Program;Random Allocation;Resources;Role;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Survey Methods;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Thinking;Time;Work;Youth,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33331919,2020,Incidence and Characteristics of Nonfatal Opioid Overdose Among Youths Aged 11 to 24 Years by Sex.,"Opioid-related overdose has substantially increased among adolescents and young adults in recent years. How overdose differs by age and sex among youths and the factors associated with overdose by sex remain poorly described. To compare the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of female and male youths who have experienced a nonfatal opioid overdose (NFOD) and compare the incidence of NFOD by sex. This retrospective cohort study used data on US individuals aged 11 to 24 years with a diagnosis of NFOD from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2017. Sex. The primary outcome was NFOD stratified by sex; covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Among 20 312 youths aged 11 to 24 years who had a history of NFOD and met study eligibility criteria, the median age was 20 years (interquartile range, 18-22 years; mean [SD] age, 20.0 [2.9] years) and 56.7% were male. Compared with male youths, female youths had a higher baseline prevalence of mood or anxiety disorder (65.5% vs 51.9%, P &lt; .001), trauma and stress-related disorders (16.4% vs 10.1%, P &lt; .001), and history of suicide attempt or self-harm (14.6% vs 9.9%, P &lt; .001). Male youths had a higher prevalence of opioid use disorder (44.7% vs 29.2%, P &lt; .001), cannabis use disorder (18.3% vs 11.3%, P &lt; .001), and alcohol use disorder (20.3% vs 14.4%, P &lt; .001). The incidence rate ratio of NFODs in females vs males was greater than 1 for ages 11 to 16 years and was less than or equal to 1 after age 17 years. This cohort study found differences between female and male youths in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and incidence of NFOD.

33476863,2021,"Co-use of methamphetamine and opioids among people in treatment in Oregon: A qualitative examination of interrelated structural, community, and individual-level factors.","Rates of methamphetamine use and methamphetamine-related deaths have increased steadily in the United States in recent years. Methamphetamine is increasingly present in opioid-related deaths. An initial study of de-identified urine specimens (n = 102) collected at a drug treatment program between 2017 and 2018 indicated that 61% of specimens contained methamphetamine; of the specimens containing methamphetamine, people were, on average, five years younger than those who tested negative for methamphetamine; and non-fentanyl opioids were more than three times as common in methamphetamine positive specimens. The National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS) Coordinating Center initiated a HotSpot Study to assess whether there was an emerging dynamic in the area, or if enhanced data collection could give insights into the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. A qualitative study, grounded in principles of rapid ethnographic assessment and a social science/anthropological framework was conducted and used methodological complementarity to contextualize results from the initial urinalysis study. Targeted sampling was conducted at two treatment sites. Program staff and patients were recruited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured interviews to assess structural, community, and individual-level factors impacting methamphetamine and opioid co-use. Within our broader framework of structural, community, and individual-level factors intersecting co-use, our data yielded three sub-themes: 1) the circulation of stigma regarding methamphetamine use was consistently described by both patients and staff and this intersected structural changes in treatment policy and suggested compounded stigma; 2) community-level factors and temporality were important for understanding patterns of methamphetamine use and for further interpreting the initial urinalysis; 3) patient rationales regarding the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids included strategies to mitigate the harms of heroin, as well as to detox or titrate the effects of heroin. Using an ethnographically-oriented and social science/anthropological approach and methodological complementarity to contextualize the prior urinalysis study demonstrates how behavioral variables cannot be abstracted from larger socio-structural and community contexts which impact people's decision-making process regarding co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. Further, by grounding our analysis in the meaning-centered and experiential narratives of people who use drugs, our research demonstrates the importance of considering the expertise of people who co-use opioids and methamphetamine as central for informing future sustainable program planning to address co-use that also accounts for the interrelationship between structural, community, and individual-level factors.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Comprehension;Data Collection;Death;Decision Making;Drug Overdose;Fentanyl;Focus Groups;Future;Harm Reduction;Heroin;Humans;Interview;Methamphetamine;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Program;Research;Social Sciences;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Urinalysis;Urine",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Recent empirical interest in the construct of boredom has revealed that some similar associations may exist for boredom during adolescence. Both boredom and sensation seeking peak during adolescence, and yet, research on boredom and its interaction with sensation seeking are limited. In a multi-cohort, US nationally representative sample of 8th and 10th grade students from the monitoring the future study, latent-moderated structural equation modeling was used to estimate the association of boredom, sensation seeking, and their interaction, to substance use, externalizing behavior, and depressive affect. Moderation by gender was also tested. Boredom and sensation seeking were both significantly associated with most dependent variables. Significant interaction effects were found wherein individuals high on both boredom and sensation seeking reported the highest levels of depressive affect and externalizing behavior. There were no significant interaction effects for substance use indices. Gender moderation was found for depressive affect. The results of this study demonstrate the generalizability of boredom associations and the significance of boredom by sensation-seeking interactions across multiple mental health domains during adolescence.

33526045,2021,Assessing the impact of a restrictive opioid prescribing law in West Virginia.,"The Opioid Reduction Act (SB 273) took effect in West Virginia in June 2018. This legislation limited ongoing chronic opioid prescriptions to 30 days' supply, and first-time opioid prescriptions to 7 days' supply for surgeons and 3 days' for emergency rooms and dentists. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of this legislation on reducing opioid prescriptions in West Virginia, with the goal of informing future similar policy efforts. Data were requested from the state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) including overall number of opioid prescriptions, number of first-time opioid prescriptions, average daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and prescription duration (expressed as ""days' supply"") given to adults during the 64 week time periods before and after legislation enactment. Statistical analysis was done utilizing an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) interrupted time series analysis to assess impact of both legislation announcement and enactment while controlling secular trends and considering autocorrelation trends. Benzodiazepine prescriptions were utilized as a control. Our analysis demonstrates a significant decrease in overall state opioid prescribing as well as a small change in average daily MME associated with the date of the legislation's enactment when considering serial correlation in the time series and accounting for pre-intervention trends. There was no such association found with benzodiazepine prescriptions. Results of the current study suggest that SB 273 was associated with an average 22.1% decrease of overall opioid prescriptions and a small change in average daily MME relative to the date of legislative implementation in West Virginia. There was, however, no association of the legislation on first-time opioid prescriptions or days' supply of opioid medication, and all variables were trending downward prior to implementation of SB 273. The control demonstrated no relationship to the law.","Accounting;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Arima;Association;Benzodiazepine;Dates;Dentists;Emergency Service, Hospital;Future;Goals;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Law;Legislation;Morphine;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Overall;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Relatives;Supplies;Surgeons;Time;West Virginia",,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33587136,2021,Projected Estimates of Opioid Mortality After Community-Level Interventions.,"The United States is experiencing a crisis of opioid overdose. In response, the US Department of Health and Human Services has defined a goal to reduce overdose mortality by 40% by 2022. To identify specific combinations of 3 interventions (initiating more people to medications for opioid use disorder [MOUD], increasing 6-month retention with MOUD, and increasing naloxone distribution) associated with at least a 40% reduction in opioid overdose in simulated populations. This decision analytical model used a dynamic population-level state-transition model to project outcomes over a 2-year horizon. Each intervention scenario was compared with the counterfactual of no intervention in simulated urban and rural communities in Massachusetts. Simulation modeling was used to determine the associations of community-level interventions with opioid overdose rates. The 3 examined interventions were initiation of more people to MOUD, increasing individuals' retention with MOUD, and increasing distribution of naloxone. Data were analyzed from July to November 2020. Reduction in overdose mortality, medication treatment capacity needs, and naloxone needs. No single intervention was associated with a 40% reduction in overdose mortality in the simulated communities. Reaching this goal required use of MOUD and naloxone. Achieving a 40% reduction required that 10% to 15% of the estimated OUD population not already receiving MOUD initiate MOUD every month, with 45% to 60%% retention for at least 6 months, and increased naloxone distribution. In all feasible settings and scenarios, attaining a 40% reduction in overdose mortality required that in every month, at least 10% of the population with OUD who were not currently receiving treatment initiate an MOUD. In this modeling study, only communities with increased capacity for treating with MOUD and increased MOUD retention experienced a 40% decrease in overdose mortality. These findings could provide a framework for developing community-level interventions to reduce opioid overdose death.",Association;Community;Computer Simulation;Death;Decision Support Techniques;Goals;Humans;Massachusetts;Mortality;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Population;Population Dynamics;Retention in Care;Rural Communities;Rural Population;Therapeutics;United States;United States Dept. of Health and Human Services;Urban Population,Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33739476,2021,Opioid use disorder and overdose among youth following an initial opioid prescription.,"Some adolescents and young adults (termed ""youth"") prescribed an opioid will develop opioid use disorder or experience overdose. This study aimed to identify patient and prescription characteristics associated with subsequent risk of opioid use disorder or overdose during the year after an opioid is first dispensed. Retrospective cohort study. Commercial health insurance claims in a large United States (US) database from 2006 to 2016. Youth age 11 to 25 years filling an initial opioid prescription (n = 3 278 990). The primary outcome was development of an 'opioid-related complication' (a diagnosis of opioid use disorder or opioid-related overdose) during the subsequent 12 months. Exposures of interest were patient (sociodemographic information, and physical and mental health diagnoses) and prescription characteristics (opioid formulation, dose, and duration). Among youth filling an initial opioid prescription, median age was 18 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 16-21) and 56.1% were female. During the subsequent 12 months, 10 405 (0.3%) youth experienced an opioid-related complication. Conditions associated with increased risk included mood/anxiety disorders (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 4.45; 95% CI = 4.25-4.66) and substance use (aRR = 20.77; 95% CI = 19.74-21.84). Comorbid substance use disorders were present among 72.8% of youth experiencing an opioid-related complication and included alcohol (33.4%), cannabis (33.0%), nicotine (43.2%), and other substance use disorders (75.5%). Long-acting opioids (aRR = 2.59; 95% CI = 2.18-3.09) and longer durations were associated with increased risk (7-14 days: aRR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.08-1.22; ≥15 days: aRR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.80-2.12) compared with short-acting formulations and durations ≤3 days, respectively. Among United States youth, complications after an initial opioid prescription appear to be relatively rare and appear to be associated with mood/anxiety disorders, substance use, comorbid substance use disorders, and prescriptions involving long-acting opioids or long durations.","Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety Disorders;Cannabis;Child;Cohort Studies;Database;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Female;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Insurance, Health;Mental Health;Mood;Nicotine;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prescriptions;Relative Risk;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;United States;Young Adult;Youth",Anxiety Disorders;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33759726,2021,Alcohol trajectories and subsequent risk for opioid misuse in a cohort of urban adolescents.,"Background: The opioid epidemic is a public health emergency in the US. Alcohol is the most widely used addictive substance among all age groups; however, the contribution of different alcohol use trajectories throughout adolescence and young adulthood to the development of opioid misuse in young adulthood among urban minority youth has not been investigated. Methods: Data are from a study of 580 youth (85% African American, 67% low SES) residing in Baltimore City followed from ages 6-26. Alcohol trajectories were identified between ages 14 and 26 using group-based trajectory modeling. Opioid misuse was defined as using opioid painkillers without a prescription or using heroin between ages 19 and 26. Opioid misuse outcomes were also investigated separately. Logistic regression examined associations of alcohol trajectories with opioid misuse in young adulthood adjusting for socio-demographics, early use of tobacco and cannabis, neighborhood, and peer factors. Results: Six alcohol use trajectories were identified: Young adult increasing (21.4%), adult increasing (19.1%), abstaining (19.1%), experimenting (15.3%), adolescent increasing (14.8%), and adolescent limited (10.2%). In models fully adjusted for covariates, relative to the abstaining trajectory, the adolescent increasing trajectory was associated with an elevated risk of opioid misuse (aOR = 3.3, 95%CI = 1.4, 7.8) and prescription opioid misuse (aOR = 3.9, 95%CI = 1.4, 10.8) in young adulthood. Conclusions: Escalating alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood is associated with an elevated risk of opioid misuse in young adulthood in a cohort of predominantly African American and socio-economically disadvantaged young people. Tailored interventions should target high levels of alcohol use during these developmental periods to reduce risk for opioid misuse among disadvantaged youth.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;African Americans;Age Groups;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Baltimore;Cannabis;Child;Cities;Cohort Studies;Demography;Disadvantaged;Emergencies;Heroin;Humans;Logistic Regression;Methods;Neighborhood;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Public Health;Relatives;Risk;Tobacco;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
33865194,2021,Can electronic prescribing mandates reduce opioid-related overdoses?,"As the opioid crisis has escalated, states have enacted numerous policies targeting opioid access and monitoring possible misuse. Recently, the majority of states have passed electronic prescribing mandates for controlled substances. These mandates require that controlled substances be prescribed electronically directly to the pharmacy. The electronic system maintains a rich patient history that prescribers will observe when issuing a prescription while also reducing opportunities for fraud. The first enforced mandate was implemented in New York in March 2016; thus empirical evidence about the effects of such mandates is limited. We study how adoption of the New York e-prescribing mandate affected opioid supply and opioid-related overdoses. We estimate that the mandate reduced the rate of overdoses involving natural and semi-synthetic opioids by 22 %. We find little evidence of any corresponding changes in overdose rates involving illicit opioids.","Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Controlled Substances;Drug Overdose;Electronic Prescribing;Electronics;Fraud;History;Humans;New York;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Patients;Pharmacy;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Supplies;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Econ Hum Biol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

In this retrospective cohort study conducted in a single addiction psychiatry clinic, electronic health record data from July 14, 2014, through January 15, 2020, were queried for clinical ADHD diagnosis (DSM-5 criteria), ADHD pharmacotherapy, treatment duration, demographic variables, comorbid psychiatric and SUD diagnoses, and buprenorphine therapy. Individuals with ADHD (n = 203) were grouped by ADHD pharmacotherapy status (171 receiving medication compared to 32 receiving none). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed and assessed for significance. ADHD was clinically diagnosed in 9.4% of outpatients and was associated with younger age, comorbid cocaine use, and private insurance (P &lt; .001). Individuals receiving no ADHD pharmacotherapy were younger than those receiving medication (P = .003). Compared to no ADHD medication, ADHD pharmacotherapy was associated with greater long-term retention, with apparent group half-lives of 9 months and 36 months, respectively (P &lt; .001). Individuals receiving no ADHD medication had a 4.9-fold increased likelihood of attrition within 90 days (P = .041). Regression analysis showed only ADHD pharmacotherapy to be significantly associated with treatment retention (hazard ratio = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.86; P = .008). ADHD pharmacotherapy is robustly associated with improved short- and longer-term retention in outpatient SUD treatment. The retrospective, nonrandomized naturalistic study design limits causal inference.

34014209,2022,Toward a Typology of Office-based Buprenorphine Treatment Laws: Themes From a Review of State Laws.,"Buprenorphine is a gold standard treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Some US states have passed laws regulating office-based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) for OUD, with requirements beyond those required in federal law. We sought to identify themes in state OBBT laws. Using search terms related to medications for OUD, we searched Westlaw software for state regulations and statutes in 51 US jurisdictions from 2005 to 2019. We identified and inductively analyzed OBBT laws for themes. Since 2005, 10 states have passed a total of 181 OBBT laws. We identified the following themes: (1) provider credentials: state licensure for OBBT providers and continuing medical education requirements; (2) new patients: objective symptoms patients must have before receiving OBBT and exceptions for special populations; (3) educating patients: general informed consent requirements, and specific information to provide; (4) counseling: minimum counselor credentials, minimum counseling frequency, counseling alternatives; (5) patient monitoring: required prescription drug monitoring checks, frequency of drug screening, and responses to lost/stolen medications; (6) enhanced clinician monitoring: evidence-based treatment protocols, minimum clinician-patient contact frequency, health assessment requirements, and individualized treatment planning; and (7) patient safety: reconciling prescriptions, dosage limitations, naloxone coprescribing, tapering, and office closures. Some laws codify practices for which scientific consensus is lacking. Additionally, some OBBT laws resemble opioid treatment programs and pain management regulations. Results could serve as the basis for a typology of office-based treatment laws, which could facilitate empirical examination of policy impacts on treatment access and quality.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Consensus;Counseling;Counselors;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Education, Medical, Continuing;Gold;Health;Humans;Informed Consent;Law;Licensure;Naloxone;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain Management;Patient Monitoring;Patient Safety;Patients;Policy;Population;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Program;Regulation;Review;Software;Standards;Therapeutics;Treatment Protocols;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34080552,2021,Use of buprenorphine for those with employer-sponsored insurance during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To quantify weekly rates of use of buprenorphine for those with employer-based insurance and whether the rate differs based on county-level measures of race, historical fatal drug overdose rate, and COVID-19 case rate. We used 2020 pharmaceutical claims for 4.8 million adults from a privately insured population to examine changes in the use of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantified variation by examining changes in use rates across counties based on their fatal drug overdose rate in 2018, number of COVID-19 cases per capita, and percent nonwhite. Weekly use of buprenorphine was relatively stable between the first week of January (0.6 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CI = 0.2 to 1.1) and the last week of August (0.8 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CI = 0.4 to 1.3). We did not find evidence of any consistent change in use of buprenorphine by county-level terciles for COVID-19 rate as of August 31, 2020, age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate, and percent nonwhite. Use was consistently higher for counties in the highest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate when compared to counties in the lowest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate. Our results provide early evidence that new federal- and state-level policies may have steadied the rate of using buprenorphine for those with employer-based insurance during the pandemic.",Adult;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Drug Overdose;Humans;Insurance;Measures;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Racial Stocks;SARS-CoV-2;United States,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34096671,2022,Association between punitive policies and neonatal abstinence syndrome among Medicaid-insured infants in complex policy environments.,"To estimate the association between punitive policies for women with substance use during pregnancy and odds of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) diagnosis among Medicaid-insured infants, and to estimate this association controlling for the presence of four other policies related to substance use in pregnancy. Analysis of live births in Medicaid claims data from 39 US states in varying years between 2006 and 2014 using weighted generalized linear models with clustered standard errors and state and year fixed-effects. NAS rates in states without punitive policies were compared with rates in states with policies before and after policy enactment using logistic regression models adjusted for individual and county-level factors and including state and year fixed-effects. We estimated odds of NAS controlling for the presence of a potentially treatment-deterring policy requiring reporting of suspected prenatal substance use, and three treatment-supportive policies that create targeted programs for pregnant and postpartum women, prioritize pregnant women's access to substance use disorder treatment programs and prohibit discrimination towards pregnant women in treatment programs. Among 9 714 798 weighted live births (1 896 082 unweighted), 49 670 (0.51%) had an NAS diagnosis. The findings were inconclusive as to whether or not punitive policies were associated with odds of NAS either in the short or long term. Odds of NAS among infants born in states with reporting policies were lower than those born in states without such policies [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.98]. In the United States, punitive policies for women with substance use during pregnancy do not appear to be associated with lower odds of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Reporting policies, which are heterogenous in their components and implementation, appear to be associated with lower odds of NAS when controlling for other relevant policies.","Association;Confidence Intervals;Diagnosis;Environment;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Linear Models;Live Birth;Logistic Regression;Medicaid;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Policy;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnant Women;Program;Standards;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States;Women",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Syndrome,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34108436,2022,"Pain, cannabis use, and physical and mental health indicators among veterans and nonveterans: results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III.","Chronic pain is associated with mental and physical health difficulties and is prevalent among veterans. Cannabis has been put forth as a treatment for chronic pain, and changes in laws, attitudes, and use patterns have occurred over the past 2 decades. Differences in prevalence of nonmedical cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) were examined across 2 groups: veterans or nonveterans and those reporting or not reporting recent pain. Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (2012-2013; n = 36,309) were analyzed using logistic regression. Prevalence differences (PDs) for 3 cannabis outcomes (1) past-year nonmedical cannabis use, (2) frequent (≥3 times a week) nonmedical use, and (3) DSM-5 CUD were estimated for those reporting recent moderate to severe pain (veterans or nonveterans) and veterans reporting or not reporting recent pain. Difference in differences was calculated to investigate PDs on outcomes associated with residence in a state with medical cannabis laws (MCLs). Associations between physical and mental health and cannabis variables were tested. The results indicated that the prevalence of recent pain was greater among veterans (PD = 7.25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [4.90-9.60]). Among veterans, the prevalence of frequent cannabis use was greater among those with pain (PD = 1.92%, 98% CI [0.21-3.63]), and among veterans residing in a state with MCLs, the prevalence of CUD was greater among those reporting recent pain (PD = 3.88%, 98% CI [0.36-7.39]). Findings failed to support the hypothesis that cannabis use improves mental or physical health for veterans with pain.

The database search identified 1267 independent citations; 29 publications met inclusion criteria. Nearly all the studies demonstrated high risk of bias, most often due to selection and confounding bias. Most of the studies in the review (k = 20, 69%) found at least one significant association between social connection and opioid outcomes. Although no two studies included the same measures of social connection or opioid misuse, and social connection was both positively and negatively associated with opioid misuse, results support that social connection is an important correlate of opioid misuse. This review highlights the importance of social connection as a correlate to opioid misuse. However, the extensive variability among research studies points to a need for standardization of measurement and larger studies with diverse populations to allow for consequential recommendations for prevention or treatment of opioid misuse. Evidence regarding the associations between social connection and opioid misuse or disorder is sparse. We provide suggestions for advancing this research, including clarification of the complex influences between social connections and opioid misuse.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Bias;Database;Humans;Measures;Needs;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Population;Prescription Drug Misuse;PubMed;Publications;Research;Review;Risk;Standardization;Suggestion;Systematic Review;Therapeutics",Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Use Misuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34148756,2022,Potential barriers to filling buprenorphine and naltrexone prescriptions among a retrospective cohort of individuals with opioid use disorder.,"Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are highly effective, but barriers along the cascade of care for opioid use disorder (OUD) from diagnosis to treatment limit their reach. For individuals desiring MOUD, the final step in the cascade is filling a written prescription, and fill rates have not been described. We used data from a large de-identified database linking individuals' electronic medical records (EMR) and administrative claims data and employed a previously developed algorithm to identify individuals with a new diagnosis of OUD. We included individuals with a prescription for buprenorphine or naltrexone recorded in the EMR. The outcome was a prescription fill within 30 days as reported in claims data. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between those who did and did not fill the prescription and used a Kaplan-Meier curve to assess whether fill rates differed based on patient copay. We identified 264 individuals with a new diagnosis of OUD who had a prescription written for buprenorphine or oral naltrexone. Of these, 70% (184) filled the prescription within 30 days, and more than half (57%) filled the prescription on the day it was written. Individuals with prescription copay at or below the mean had a 75% fill rate at 30 days compared with 63% for those with copay above the mean (p &lt; 0.05) and this difference was consistent across fill times (log rank p-value &lt;0.05). It is alarming that nearly 1 in 3 MOUD prescriptions go unfilled.

34245974,2021,Longitudinal effects of adverse childhood experiences on substance use transition patterns during young adulthood.,"Few studies have investigated how adverse childhood experiences are associated with substance use patterns during young adulthood, a crucial developmental period. The objective of this study was to extend current knowledge on the association between adverse childhood experiences and patterns of substance use among young adults. We also sought to understand how current mental health status and biological sex influences these patterns. The current study utilized wave 8-wave 11 data of a longitudinal cohort study (N = 2880). We used latent transition analysis (LTA) to understand stability and transition patterns of substance use across participants who reported adverse childhood experiences (ACEs+) versus those who did not (ACEs-). Latent class regression was used to assess contemporaneous effects of mental health and sex on classes over time. Both groups had similar patterns of substance use emerge at each timepoint: High all; Binge, tobacco, cannabis; and Steady/increasing binge drinking. ACEs+ had a higher proportion of youth in the High all class and much higher stability in this class, compared to the ACEs- group. Those in the ACES+ group were less likely to transition out of a riskier class. Mental health and sex showed differential effects across ACEs groups. Results point to increased risk of polysubstance use, including opioids and prescription medications, among those who reported adverse childhood events. Future work may explore protective, malleable, factors that may confer reduced risk of long-term polysubstance use.","Adolescent;Adult;Adverse Childhood Experiences;Association;Binge Drinking;Biopharmaceuticals;Cannabis;Cohort Studies;Future;Humans;Knowledge;Longitudinal Studies;Mental Health;Opioids;Prescriptions;Risk;Sex;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Time;Tobacco;Victimization;Work;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult;Youth","Binge Drinking;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries",Child Abuse Negl,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Specifically, parental opioid and methamphetamine abuse have increased over the last decade, with associated increases of families reported to the child welfare system. The Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR) program was developed to address the complexities of these families. Evidence-based strategies to address the interrelated needs of parents-including substance abuse and mental health treatment, parent skills training, and supportive case management to improve access to ancillary needs-are integrated in an intensive community outpatient program. This study examined the clinical effectiveness of FAIR when delivered in a Medicaid billable outpatient clinic. Parents (n = 99) were randomized either to the immediate FAIR condition or to the Waitlist (WL) condition, using a dynamic wait-listed design, with all parents provided the opportunity to eventually receive FAIR. Outcomes show statistically and clinically significant reductions in parental opioid and methamphetamine use, mental health symptoms, and parenting risk, and improvements in stability in parents receiving FAIR. Providing services to families who require travel in excess of 20 miles for sessions has challenging implications for program costs under a Medicaid structure.

34278971,2021,Toward a National System of Expanded Testing of Existing Urine Specimens: The Drug Outbreak Testing Service (DOTS).,"NIDA's National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS) was established in 2014 with the mission of identifying and monitoring emerging drugs in the United States. Identification of emerging drugs has been complicated, however, by the rapid development of novel psychoactive substances such that users often cannot identify and report the drugs they have ingested. Biologic testing of urine, hair or blood is the only way to reliably identify the substances recently used. Unfortunately, the large number of up-to-date tests required is beyond the resources available to most organizations. The DOTS study tested the feasibility of recruiting organizations to submit up to 25 de-identified urine specimens for testing for approximately 240 drugs, at no cost to them. The results were for epidemiologic purposes only and not for clinical use. Eleven sites who had questions about their patients or the results of their organization's more limited urinalysis screens participated. These sites included drug treatment programs, medical examiners, hospitals and a criminal justice testing program. Extensive polydrug use and geographic differences in the drugs detected were found. All sites found the DOTS collaborating laboratory's test results to be very useful for understanding the types of drugs being used recently and to assess the adequacy of their testing protocols. The U.S. should consider establishing a program of expanded testing of already collected de-identified urine specimens in order to identify emerging drugs and track local patterns of use and availability.","Biopharmaceuticals;Blood;Comprehension;Cost;Criminal Justice;Dates;Disease Outbreaks;Examiner, Medical;Hair;Hospitals;Humans;Laboratories;Organizations;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Religious Missions;Report;Resources;Substance Abuse Detection;Therapeutics;Toxicology;Track;United States;Urinalysis;Urine",Substance Abuse,Subst Use Misuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34305753,2021,The Family Check-Up Online: A Telehealth Model for Delivery of Parenting Skills to High-Risk Families With Opioid Use Histories.,"Growing opioid misuse in the United States has resulted in more children living with an adult with an opioid use history. Although an abundance of research has demonstrated a link between opioid misuse and negative parenting behaviors, few intervention efforts have been made to target this underserved population. The Family Check-Up (FCU) has been tested in more than 25 years of research, across multiple settings, and is an evidence-based program for reducing risk behavior, enhancing parenting skills, and preventing the onset of substance use. It is designed to motivate parents to engage in positive parenting practices and to change problematic parenting and has been tested across a variety of ages including early childhood and adolescence. It is highlighted in NIDA's Principles of Substance Use Prevention for Early Childhood: A research-based guide as one of only three effective selective prevention programs for substance abuse among families with young children. Recently, we developed an online version of the FCU that has now been adapted for early childhood and families with opioid use histories. The online platform and telehealth model allow for wide-scale dissemination, ease of training with community providers, and increased public health reach for families in remote, rural areas. This is particularly important when targeting families with opioid misuse and addiction because there are high rates of addiction in remote areas, yet few services available. In this article, we describe the FCU Online and review new content in the model that targets a population of young adult parents with substance abuse histories, including opioid use. New modules include content focused on harm reduction for this high-risk population of parents, such as safety in the home, substance use while parenting, and managing conflict with partners and friends.","Adolescence;Adult;Behavior;Child;Community;Family;Friends;Harm Reduction;History;News;Opioid Misuse;Opioids;Parenting;Parents;Population;Populations, Underserved;Program;Public Health;Research;Review;Risk;Risk Behavior;Safety;Scales;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Telehealth;United States;Young Adult",Opioid Misuse;Substance Abuse;Substance Use,Front Psychol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34323528,2022,Poly-victimization and opioid use during late adolescence and young adulthood: Health behavior disparities and protective factors.,"Recent work has attempted to uncover heterogeneity in experiences of victimization. However, few studies have included important trauma-related characteristics such as known perpetrator, fear of life or injury, and negative reactions to disclosure. Little focus on potentially important subgroup differences including sexual/gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as protective factors have been assessed. Participants (N = 2,880) completed four annual surveys during late adolescence and the transition to young adulthood as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Latent class analysis was used to extract classes of victimization and trauma-related characteristics. Latent class regression was used to understand how demographic covariates were related to class membership. Finally, discrete-time survival mixture analysis was used to assess latency to opioid use from ages 17 to 24 years, and how demographic and protective factors influenced opioid use across emergent classes. The four-class solution fit the data best: sexual abuse and indirect violence + high trauma characteristics (n = 79, 3.6%); high all + high trauma characteristics (n = 177; 8.1%); chronic emotional abuse + trusted perpetrator (n = 263; 12.1%); and low all (n = 1,656; 76.1%). Latent class regression results indicated differential risk of class membership by sexual/gender minority status, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Survival analysis noted shorter latency to opioid use across all classes compared to the low all class. Self-efficacy and neighborhood cohesion emerged as important protective factors. Furthermore, results highlight key individual- and community-level protective factors that decrease the risk of opioid use.

34340167,2021,Effectiveness and implementability of state-level naloxone access policies: Expert consensus from an online modified-Delphi process.,"Naloxone distribution, a key global strategy to prevent fatal opioid overdose, has been a recent target of legislation in the U.S., but there is insufficient empirical evidence from causal inference methods to identify which components of these policies successfully reduce opioid-related harms. This study aimed to examine expert consensus on the effectiveness and implementability of various state-level naloxone policies. We used the online ExpertLens platform to conduct a three-round modified-Delphi process with a purposive sample of 46 key stakeholders (advocates, healthcare providers, human/social service practitioners, policymakers, and researchers) with naloxone policy expertise. The Effectiveness Panel (n = 24) rated average effects of 15 types of policies on naloxone pharmacy distribution, opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence, nonfatal opioid-related overdoses, and opioid-related overdose mortality. The Implementation Panel (n = 22) rated the same policies on acceptability, feasibility, affordability, and equitability. We compared ratings across policies using medians and inter-percentile ranges, with consensus measured using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method Inter-Percentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry technique. Experts reached consensus on all items. Except for liability protections and required provision of education or training, experts perceived all policies to generate moderate-to-large increases in naloxone pharmacy distribution. However, only three policies were expected to yield substantive decreases on fatal overdose: statewide standing/protocol order, over-the-counter supply, and statewide ""free naloxone."" Of these, experts rated only statewide standing/protocol orders as highly affordable and equitable, and unlikely to generate meaningful population-level effects on OUD or nonfatal opioid-related overdose. Across all policies, experts rated naloxone prescribing mandates relatively lower in acceptability, feasibility, affordability, and equitability. Experts believe statewide standing/protocol orders are an effective, implementable, and equitable policy for addressing opioid-related overdose mortality. While experts believe many other broad policies are effective in reducing opioid-related harms, they also believe these policies face implementation challenges related to cost and reaching vulnerable populations.","Affordability;Analgesics, Opioid;Consensus;Cost;Drug Overdose;Education;Face;Harm Reduction;Health Personnel;Humans;Legislation;Methods;Mortality;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmacies;Pharmacy Distribution;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Research Personnel;Social Work;Supplies;Vulnerable Populations",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34352386,2021,"Optimizing scalable, technology-supported behavioral interventions to prevent opioid misuse among adolescents and young adults in the emergency department: A randomized controlled trial protocol.","Preventing opioid misuse and opioid use disorder is critical among at-risk adolescents and young adults (AYAs). An Emergency Department (ED) visit provides an opportunity for delivering interventions during a rapidly changing opioid landscape. This paper describes pilot data and the protocol for a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial testing efficacy of early interventions to reduce escalation of opioid (prescription or illicit) misuse among at-risk AYAs. Interventions are delivered using technology by health coaches. AYAs ages 16-30 in the ED screening positive for prescription opioid use (+ ≥ 1 risk factor) or opioid misuse will be stratified by risk severity, sex, and age group. Participants will be randomly assigned to a condition at intake, either a live video health coach-delivered single session or a control condition of an enhanced usual care (EUC) community resource brochure. They are also randomly assigned to one of two post-intake conditions: health coach-delivered portal-like messaging via web portal over 30 days or EUC delivered at 30 days post-intake. Thus, the trial has four groups: health coach-delivered session+portal, health coach-delivered session+EUC, EUC + portal, and EUC + EUC. Outcomes will be measured at 3-, 6-, and 12-months. The primary outcome is opioid misuse based on a modified Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Secondary outcomes include other opioid outcomes (e.g., days of opioid misuse, overdose risk behaviors), other substance misuse and consequences, and impaired driving. This study is innovative by testing the efficacy of feasible and scalable technology-enabled interventions to reduce and prevent opioid misuse and opioid use disorder.

34587580,2022,"Association between fatal opioid overdose and state medical cannabis laws in US national survey data, 2000-2011.","Most information on the relationship between medical cannabis laws (MCL) and the risk for opioid overdose fatality has been based on studies with ecological designs. To contribute additional information, we used a novel case-control design and individual-level data from national surveys to assess whether state medical cannabis laws were associated with reduced risk of fatal opioid overdose between 2000-2011. Data from participants surveyed in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1986-2011 were included. For those sampled between 1986-2009, detailed mortality follow-up data were available from the National Death Index up to 12/31/2011. Opioid overdose decedents (n = 791) were classified as cases. Between 2000-2011, all cases arising in a given year were matched to adult controls who were surveyed the same year and eligible for mortality follow-up (n = 723,920). The distribution of exposure to state MCL was contrasted between cases and controls, providing an approximation of the rate ratio of fatal opioid overdose associated with MCLs. Due to a NHIS sample redesign, we stratified analysis using timeframes before and after 2005. Overall, compared to controls, cases were more likely to be male, middle-aged, non-Hispanic White, separated/divorced; less educated, and have a family income below the poverty threshold. No overall association between state MCLs and the rate of opioid overdose was observed between 2000-2005 (aOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.83-1.79) or between 2006-2011 (aOR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.60-1.25). No significant difference between sampling timeframes was observed (ratio of aOR's = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49-1.01). We found no overall protective relationship between state MCLs and opioid overdose. Future research with more recent mortality data and more refined cannabis policy classifications would be useful. The importance of the study is two-fold. First, the findings provide an additional source of information countering claims of a protective effect of MCLs on opioid overdoses, suggesting that other solutions to the opioid overdose crisis are needed. Second, the study offers a potentially useful design to answer important population-level public health questions.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cannabis;Classification;Death;Divorced;Drug Overdose;Family;Female;Future;Health;Hispanics;Humans;Income;Index;Interview;Law;Legislation, Drug;Male;Medical Marijuana;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Overall;Policy;Population;Poverty;Public Health;Research;Risk;Separated;Solutions;Surveys;Whites",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Using data from 580 US counties in eight US states from the period 2009-17, we examined the association of county rates of NOWS and county-level characteristics with infant foster care entries. In adjusted analyses, every one diagnosis of NOWS per ten births was associated with a 41 percent higher rate of infant foster care entry, and rural county residence was associated with a 19 percent higher rate of infant foster entry. A higher employment rate was associated with lower rates of infant foster care entry both overall and in urban counties when we stratified by rurality. These findings suggest that policy makers could use information about county characteristics to better target funding to support opioid-affected families at risk for foster care involvement.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Diagnosis;Employment;Family;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioids;Overall;Parturition;Policy Makers;Risk;Rural Population;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome,Health Aff (Millwood),New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

We used data from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs. First, we calculate the national share of treatment facilities that offer one type of MOUD or all forms of MOUD using a novel dataset of providers. Second, we quantify the share of counties with a treatment facility offering at least one type of MOUD. Finally, we calculate the share of the national population residing within a 10-mile radius of a treatment facility. The share of counties with a treatment facility offering a MOUD as a form of treatment rose from 30% to 45% from 2014 to 2020 while the share of counties with facilities offering all three forms of MOUD increased from 4% to 9%. Over 83% of the population lives within 10 miles of a facility offering MOUD treatment, and 42% of the population have a treatment facility that offers all three forms of MOUD within a 10-mile radius. Much of the difference between the county- and population-based measures is explained by more population dense areas having higher rates of facilities providing MOUD. While the share of facilities within a county offering a MOUD is relatively small, the share of the population within 10 miles of such a facility is higher.",Address;Alcohol Abuse;Buprenorphine;Comprehension;Dataset;Directory;Form;Health Facilities;Humans;Measures;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Program;Radius;Rosa;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics,Alcohol Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

These challenges make it difficult for incarcerated parents reentering their communities to raise their children effectively and, thus, increase the likelihood of poor outcomes for their children. Children whose parents are also battling opioid misuse have an even higher risk for long-term problems. This study uses survey data from 48 community service providers to better understand the service needs of parents with histories of problematic opioid use who are reentering their communities after incarceration. Community service providers recommended implementing intervention programs that cover critical information related to basic needs, supportive community resources, drug treatment programs, and parenting to help individuals thrive in their communities and meet their children's needs. The services most frequently identified by providers as important for reentering parents included housing, mentors or peer counselors, mental health support, group therapy and other support programs. Key topics to address in parenting programs included problem-solving techniques, the effect of parent's addiction on children, and strategies for connecting with and meeting children's needs. Suggestions are made for future research and intervention development.","Address;Child;Community;Counselors;Family;Future;History;Housing;Mental Health;Mentors;Needs;Needs Assessment;Opioid Misuse;Opioids;Parenting;Parents;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poverty;Problem Solving;Program;Research;Resources;Risk;Self-Help Groups;Services, Community;Suggestion;Surveys;Therapeutics;Wounds and Injuries",Opioid Misuse;Wounds and Injuries,Front Psychol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Providing access to stable housing has the potential to act as a powerful preventive intervention, but supportive housing programs have been studied most often among chronically homeless adults or adults with serious mental illness. The Housing First model, which does not precondition supportive housing on sobriety, may reduce drug use in homeless adults. In the present study, we piloted an adapted model of Housing First plus prevention services that was tailored to the needs of young adults (18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in the USA. Preventive services were added to the Housing First model and included youth-centered advocacy services, motivational interviewing, and HIV risk prevention services. This model was piloted in a single-arm study (n = 21) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a Housing First model over a 6-month period in preparation for a larger randomized trial. We use repeated measures ANOVA to test for changes in alcohol and drug use (percent days of use; alcohol or drug use consequences), housing stability, social network support, and cognitive distortions over 6 months of follow-up. A total of 17 youth completed the study (85% retention), and a high proportion of youth were stably housed at 6-month follow-up. Participation in intervention services was high with an average of 13.57 sessions for advocacy, 1.33 for MI, and 0.76 for HIV prevention. Alcohol use did not change significantly over time. However, drug use, drug use consequences, and cognitive distortions, and the size of youths' social networks that were drug using individuals decreased significantly. The Housing First model appeared to be feasible to deliver, and youth engaged in the supportive intervention services. The study demonstrates the potential for an adapted Housing First model to be delivered to youth experiencing homelessness and may improve outcomes, opening the way for larger randomized trials of the intervention.",Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Analysis of Variance;Arm;Feasibility Studies;HIV;Homeless Persons;Homelessness;Housing;Humans;Measures;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Motivation;Motivational Interviewing;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilots;Program;Risk;Social Networks;Substance Use;Time;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult;Youth,Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Wounds and Injuries,Harm Reduct J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34801009,2021,Preventing opioid use among justice-involved youth as they transition to adulthood: leveraging safe adults (LeSA).,"Juvenile justice (JJ) youth are at high risk of opioid and other substance use (SU), dysfunctional family/social relationships, and complex trauma. The purpose of the Leveraging Safe Adults (LeSA) Project is to examine the effectiveness of Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®; leveraging family systems by providing emotional and instrumental guidance, support, and role modeling) in preventing opioid and other SU among youth after release from secure residential facilities. An effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Type 1 design is used to test the effectiveness of TBRI for preventing non-medical use of opioids among JJ-youth (delayed-start at the site level; a randomized controlled trial at participant level) and to gain insight into facility-level barriers to TBRI implementation as part of JJ re-entry protocols. Recruitment includes two samples (effectiveness: 360 youth/caregiver dyads; implementation: 203 JJ staff) from nine sites in two states over 3 years. Participant eligibility includes 15 to 18-year-olds disposed to community supervision and receiving care in a secure JJ facility, without active suicide risk, and with one caregiver willing to participate. Effectiveness data come from (1) youth and caregiver self-report on background, SU, psychosocial functioning, and youth-caregiver relationships (Months 0, 3, 6, 12, and 18), youth monthly post-release check-ins, and caregiver report on youth psychological/behavioral symptoms, and (2) JJ facility records (e.g., recidivism, treatment utilization). Fidelity assessment includes post-session checklists and measures of TBRI strategy use. Collected four times over four years, implementation data include (1) JJ staff self-report on facility and staff characteristics, use of trauma-informed care and TBRI strategies, and (2) focus groups (line staff, leadership separately) on use of trauma-informed strategies, uptake of new interventions, and penetration, sustainment, and expansion of TBRI practices. The LeSA study is testing TBRI as a means to empower caregivers to help prevent opioid use and other SU among JJ-youth. TBRI's multiple components offer an opportunity for caregivers to supplement and extend gains during residential care. If effective and implemented successfully, the LeSA protocol will help expand the application of TBRI with a wider audience and provide guidance for implementing multi-component interventions in complex systems spanning multiple contexts.

34861189,2022,"Clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies for addressing the US opioid epidemic: a modelling study.","The syndemic of injection drug use and serious injection-related infections is leading to increasing mortality in the USA. Although outpatient treatment with medications for opioid use disorder reduces overdose risk and recurrent infections, hospitalisation remains common. We evaluated the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies to address the US opioid epidemic. We developed a microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of: standard hospital care-detoxification for opioids, no addiction consult service (status quo); expanded inpatient prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder, including bridge prescriptions (ie, medication until they can see an outpatient provider) when possible (medications for opioid use disorder with bridge); implementation of addiction consult services within the hospital (addiction consult services alone); and a combined medication for opioid use disorder with addiction consult services strategy (combined). We used clinical trials and observational cohorts to inform model inputs. Outcomes were life-years, discounted costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, hospitalisations, and deaths. We did deterministic sensitivity analyses on key model inputs related to costs and sequelae of drug use and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to further address uncertainty. Among people who inject opioids in the USA, we estimated that expanding medications for opioid use disorder with bridge prescriptions would reduce hospitalisations and overdose deaths by 3·2% and 3·6%, respectively, and the combination of expanded medications with opioid use disorder along with addiction consult sevices would reduce hospitalisations and overdoses by 5·2% and 6·6%, respectively, compared with the status quo. Mean lifetime costs ranged from US$731 400 (95% credible interval 447 911-859 189 for the medications for opioid use disorder strategy) to $741 200 (470 930-868 551 for the combined strategy) per person. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per life-year gained, medications for opioid use disorder with bridge and combined strategies were cost-effective ($7600 and $14 300, respectively). A scenario that assumed ideal access to harm reduction services came to the same conclusions as the base case and our results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The combined interventions of expanding hospital-based prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder and implementing addiction consult services could improve life expectancy, be cost-effective, and could be the basis for a comprehensive hospital-based strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic in the USA and countries with similar opioid epidemics.

34864356,2022,Broadening access to naloxone: Community predictors of standing order naloxone distribution in Massachusetts.,"Naloxone is a prescription medication that reverses opioid overdoses. Allowing naloxone to be dispensed directly by a pharmacist without an individual prescription under a naloxone standing order (NSO) can expand access. The community-level factors associated with naloxone dispensed under NSO are unknown. Using a dataset comprised of pharmacy reports of naloxone dispensed under NSO from 70% of Massachusetts retail pharmacies, we examined relationships between community-level demographics, rurality, measures of treatment for opioid use disorder, and overdose deaths with naloxone dispensed under NSO per ZIP Code-quarter from 2014 until 2018. We used a multi-variable zero-inflated negative binomial model, assessing odds of any naloxone dispensed under NSO, as well as a multi-variable negative binomial model assessing quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO. From 2014-2018, quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO and the number of pharmacies dispensing any naloxone under NSO increased over time. However, communities with greater percentages of people with Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96 per 5% increase), and rural communities compared to urban communities (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90) were less likely to dispense any naloxone by NSO. Communities with more individuals treated with buprenorphine dispensed more naloxone under NSO, as did communities with more opioid-related overdose deaths. Naloxone dispensing has substantially increased, in part driven by standing orders. A lower likelihood of naloxone being dispensed under NSO in communities with larger Hispanic populations and in more rural communities suggests the need for more equitable access to, and uptake of, lifesaving medications like naloxone.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Community;Dataset;Death;Demography;Drug Overdose;Ethnic Groups;Harm Reduction;Hispanics;Humans;Massachusetts;Measures;Models, Binomial;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Pharmacies;Pharmacists;Population;Prescriptions;Report;Rural Communities;Standing Orders;Therapeutics;Time",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

34895172,2021,Moving beyond the classic difference-in-differences model: a simulation study comparing statistical methods for estimating effectiveness of state-level policies.,"Reliable evaluations of state-level policies are essential for identifying effective policies and informing policymakers' decisions. State-level policy evaluations commonly use a difference-in-differences (DID) study design; yet within this framework, statistical model specification varies notably across studies. More guidance is needed about which set of statistical models perform best when estimating how state-level policies affect outcomes. Motivated by applied state-level opioid policy evaluations, we implemented an extensive simulation study to compare the statistical performance of multiple variations of the two-way fixed effect models traditionally used for DID under a range of simulation conditions. We also explored the performance of autoregressive (AR) and GEE models. We simulated policy effects on annual state-level opioid mortality rates and assessed statistical performance using various metrics, including directional bias, magnitude bias, and root mean squared error. We also reported Type I error rates and the rate of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., power), given the prevalence of frequentist null hypothesis significance testing in the applied literature. Most linear models resulted in minimal bias. However, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to 160%). Further, root mean square error was minimized by linear AR models when we examined crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when we examined raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (&lt; 10%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy effectiveness in the opioid literature. When considering performance across models, the linear AR models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates. The findings highlight notable limitations of commonly used statistical models for DID designs, which are widely used in opioid policy studies and in state policy evaluations more broadly. In contrast, the optimal model we identified--the AR model--is rarely used in state policy evaluation. We urge applied researchers to move beyond the classic DID paradigm and adopt use of AR models.","Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Benchmarks;Bias;Computer Simulation;Crude Death Rate;Death;Death Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Literature;Methods;Models, Binomial;Models, Nonlinear;Models, Statistical;Opioids;Policy;Population;Power, Psychological;Prevalence;Research Personnel",Death,BMC Med Res Methodol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34957636,2022,Characterizing autistic traits in treatment-seeking young adults with substance use disorders.,"Recent work highlights an increase in the overlap of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Little is known about the presence of ASD symptoms in SUD-treatment-seeking populations. The informant-rated Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) was completed at intake to an outpatient SUD clinic for youth aged 16-26 (N = 69). Comparisons were made between those with elevated SRS-2 scores on demographic, psychiatric, and substance use variables. Parents of sixty-nine patients with SUD completed the SRS-2. Fourteen (20%) (average age 18.7 ± 2.5) had elevated SRS-2 Total T-scores (≥66) and 55 (average age 18.1 ± 2.8) had non-clinical SRS-2 Total T-scores. There were few differences between groups; however, those with elevated SRS-2 Total T-scores were more likely to have a stimulant use disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 7.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77, 101.88; p = 0.05) or an opioid use disorder (OR = 5.02, 95% CI = 0.59, 43.27; p = 0.08) than patients with normal SRS-2 Total T-scores as well as alcohol use in the week prior to intake. A significant proportion of treatment-seeking SUD outpatients suffer from clinically elevated autistic traits. These findings highlight the importance of assessing for autistic traits in SUD treatment settings yet additional research is needed to determine if these findings are specific to the presence of ASD or secondary to sequelae of specific SUD presentations.

35007956,2022,The effect of state policies on rates of high-risk prescribing of an initial opioid analgesic.,"Multiple state policies, such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and duration limits, have been implemented to decrease high-risk opioid prescribing. Studies demonstrate that many policies decrease certain opioid prescribing behaviors, but few examine their intended effects on the targeted high-risk prescribing practices, nor disentangle the effects of concurrent state or federal policies likely to influence those practices. Forty-one million initial prescriptions for new opioid episodes from 2007 to 2018 were identified using national pharmacy claims. We identified high-risk initial prescriptions, defined as &gt;7 days' supply, average daily MME &gt;90, or concurrent with benzodiazepines and estimated three multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association between policies and outcomes controlling for patient, prescriber, and county characteristics. Initial prescriptions for &gt;7 days declined from 23.8% in 2007 to 14.9% in 2018, associated with mandatory and interoperable PDMPs and prescription duration limits but not other policies examined. Initial prescriptions with daily MME &gt; 90 declined from 13.2% to 1.9%, associated with pain management clinic laws but not consistently with other policies. Initial prescriptions concurrent with benzodiazepines declined only modestly from 6.9% to 6.5%, associated with pain management clinic laws but not other policies examined. The opioid policy environment has changed rapidly with a range of different policies being implemented addressing high-risk prescribing. PDMP laws mandating prescriber use and pain clinic laws both appear efficacious but decrease different types of high-risk opioid prescribing. New policies should be considered in light of the prevalence of the problem being addressed.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Behavior;Benzodiazepine;Drug Prescriptions;Environment;Humans;Law;Light;Logistic Regression;News;Opioids;Pain Clinics;Pain Management;Patients;Pharmacy;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Risk;Supplies",Pain,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35067400,2022,Beyond state scope of practice laws for advanced practitioners: Additional supervision requirements for buprenorphine prescribing.,"Buprenorphine is a life-saving medication for people with opioid use disorder (OUD). U.S. federal law allows advanced practice clinicians (APCs), such as nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs), to obtain a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in office-based practices. However, states regulate APCs' scope of practice (SOP) variously, including requirements for physician supervision. States may also have laws entirely banning NP/PA buprenorphine prescribing or requiring that supervising physicians have a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. We sought to identify prevalence of state laws other than SOP laws that either 1) prohibit NP/PA buprenorphine prescribing entirely, or 2) require supervision by a federally waivered physician. We searched for state statutes and regulations in all 50 states and Washington D.C. regulating prescribing of buprenorphine for OUD by APCs during summer 2021. We excluded general scope of practice laws, laws only applicable to Medicaid-funded clinicians, laws not applicable to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, and laws only applicable to NPs/PAs serving licensed SUD treatment facilities. We then conducted content analysis. One state prohibits all APCs from prescribing buprenorphine for OUD, even though the state's general SOP laws permit APC buprenorphine prescribing. Five states require PA supervision by a federally waivered physician. Three states require NP supervision by a federally waivered physician. Aside from general scope of practice laws, several states have created laws explicitly regulating buprenorphine prescribing by APCs outside of licensed state SUD facilities.","Buprenorphine;District of Columbia;Humans;Law;Life;Medicaid;Nurse Practitioners;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Permits;Persons;Physician Assistants;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prevalence;Regulation;Savings;Scope of Practice;Substance Use Disorders;Supervision;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35132556,2022,Naloxone Co-Dispensing with Opioids: a Cluster Randomized Pragmatic Trial.,"Although naloxone prevents opioid overdose deaths, few patients prescribed opioids receive naloxone, limiting its effectiveness in real-world settings. Barriers to naloxone prescribing include concerns that naloxone could increase risk behavior and limited time to provide necessary patient education. To determine whether pharmacy-based naloxone co-dispensing affected opioid risk behavior. Secondary objectives were to assess if co-dispensing increased naloxone acquisition, increased patient knowledge about naloxone administration, and affected opioid dose and other substance use. Cluster randomized pragmatic trial of naloxone co-dispensing. Safety-net health system in Denver, Colorado, between 2017 and 2020. Seven pharmacies were randomized. Pharmacy patients (N=768) receiving opioids were followed using automated data for 10 months. Pharmacy patients were also invited to complete surveys at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months; 325 survey participants were enrolled from November 15, 2017, to January 8, 2019. Intervention pharmacies implemented workflows to co-dispense naloxone while usual care pharmacies provided usual services. Survey instruments assessed opioid risk behavior; hazardous drinking; tobacco, cannabis, and other drug use; and knowledge. Naloxone dispensings and opioid dose were evaluated using pharmacy data among pharmacy patients and survey participants. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using generalized linear mixed models accounting for clustering at the pharmacy level. Opioid risk behavior did not differ by trial group (P=0.52; 8-month vs. baseline adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 1.07; 95% CI 0.78, 1.47). Compared with usual care pharmacies, naloxone dispensings were higher in intervention pharmacies (ARR 3.38; 95% CI 2.21, 5.15) and participant knowledge increased (P=0.02; 8-month vs. baseline adjusted mean difference 1.05; 95% CI 0.06, 2.04). There was no difference in other substance use by the trial group. Co-dispensing naloxone with opioids effectively increased naloxone receipt and knowledge but did not increase self-reported risk behavior.

35143969,2022,"Trends in Prescriptions for Non-opioid Pain Medications Among U.S. Adults With Moderate or Severe Pain, 2014-2018.","As opioid prescribing has declined, it is unclear how the landscape of prescription pain treatment across the U.S. has changed. We used nationally-representative data from the Medical Expenditure Health Survey, 2014 to 2018 to examine trends in prescriptions for opioid and non-opioid pain medications, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentinoids, and antidepressants among U.S. adults with self-reported pain. Overall, from 2014 to 2018, the percentage of participants receiving a prescription for opioids declined, (38.8% vs 32.8%), remained stable for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (26.8% vs 27.7%), and increased for acetaminophen (1.6% vs 2.3%), antidepressants (9.6% vs 12.0%) and gabapentinoids (13.2% vs 19.0%). In this period, the adjusted odds of receiving an opioid prescription decreased (aOR = .93, 95% CI = .90-.96), while the adjusted odds of receiving antidepressant, gabapentinoid and acetaminophen prescriptions increased (antidepressants: aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.13 gabapentinoids: aOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.17; acetaminophen: aOR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20). Secondary analyses stratifiying within the 2014 to 2016 and 2016 to 2018 periods revealed particular increases in prescriptions for gabapentinoids (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05-1.21) and antidepressants (aOR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.35) since 2016. PERSPECTIVE: These data demonstrate that physicians are increasingly turning to CDC-recommended non-opioid medications for pain management, particularly antidepressants and gabapentinoids. However, evidence for these medications' efficacy in treating numerous common pain conditions, including low back pain, remains limited.","Acetaminophen;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal;Antidepressive Agents;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Epidemiology;Gabapentin;Health Expenditures;Humans;Low Back Pain;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Management;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Pregabalin;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Self;Surveys;Therapeutics",Low Back Pain;Pain,J Pain,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35197100,2022,"Study protocol for a cluster randomized trial of a school, family, and community intervention for preventing drug misuse among older adolescents in the Cherokee Nation.","The national opioid crisis has disproportionately burdened rural White populations and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. Therefore, Cherokee Nation and Emory University public health scientists have designed an opioid prevention trial to be conducted in rural communities in the Cherokee Nation (northeast Oklahoma) with AI and other (mostly White) adolescents and young adults. Our goal is to implement and evaluate a theory-based, integrated multi-level community intervention designed to prevent the onset and escalation of opioid and other drug misuse. Two distinct intervention approaches-community organizing, as implemented in our established Communities Mobilizing for Change and Action (CMCA) intervention protocol, and universal school-based brief intervention and referral, as implemented in our established Connect intervention protocol-will be integrated with skill-based training for adults to strengthen social support for youth and also with strategic media. Furthermore, we will test systems for sustained implementation within existing organizational structures of the Cherokee Nation and local schools and communities. This study protocol describes the cluster randomized trial, designed to measure implementation and evaluate the effectiveness on primary and secondary outcomes. Using a cluster randomized controlled design and constrained randomization, this trial will allocate 20 high schools and surrounding communities to either an intervention or delayed-intervention comparison condition. With a proposed sample of 20 high schools, all enrolled 10th grade students in fall 2021 (ages 15 to 17) will be eligible for participation. During the trial, we will (1) implement interventions through the Cherokee Nation and measure implementation processes and fidelity, (2) measure opioid and other drug use and secondary outcomes every 6 months among a cohort of high school students followed over 3 years through their transition out of high school, (3) test via a cluster randomized trial the effect of the integrated CMCA-Connect intervention, and (4) analyze implementation costs. Primary outcomes include the number of days during the past 30 days of (1) any alcohol use, (2) heavy alcohol use (defined as having at least four, among young women, or five, among young men, standard alcoholic drinks within a couple of hours), (3) any marijuana use, and (4) prescription opioid misuse (defined as ""without a doctor's prescription or differently than how a doctor or medical provider told you to use it""). This trial will expand upon previous research advancing the scientific evidence regarding prevention of opioid and other drug misuse during the critical developmental period of late adolescent transition to young adulthood among a sample of American Indian and other youth living within the Cherokee Nation reservation.

We explored the trajectories and correlates of pain intensity. Adolescents with an opioid prescription to treat acute pain (N = 157) completed demographic questions, and the PROMIS pediatric depression and anxiety subscales. A 10-day daily diary assessed pain intensity, pain interference, sleep quality, and opioid use. Three trajectories of pain intensity emerged: (1) slow decreases in pain, (2) rapid decreases in pain, and (3) stable or slight increases in pain. Teens with stable pain demonstrated the greatest anxiety levels. Higher sleep quality predicted lower next day pain intensity and pain interference, when controlling for opioid use. Future research should employ intensive longitudinal methodology to further guide intervention development and prevent the transition to chronic pain.","Acute Pain;Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Child;Chronic Pain;Demography;Depression;Diary;Future;General Surgery;Humans;Musculoskeletal Pain;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pediatrics;Prescriptions;Research;Sleep;Teens;Therapeutics",Acute Pain;Chronic Pain;Musculoskeletal Pain;Pain,J Behav Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35272687,2022,"""The DEA would come in and destroy you"": a qualitative study of fear and unintended consequences among opioid prescribers in WV.","West Virginia has one of the highest rates of opioid overdose related deaths and is known as the epicenter of the opioid crisis in the United States. In an effort to reduce opioid-related harms, SB 273 was signed in 2018, and aimed to restrict opioid prescribing in West Virginia. SB 273 was enacted during a time when physician arrests and convictions had been increasing for years and were becoming more prevalent and more publicized. This study aims to better understand the impact of the legislation on patients and providers. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with opioid-prescribing primary care physicians and specialists practicing throughout West Virginia. Four themes emerged, 1. Fear of disciplinary action, 2. Exacerbation of opioid prescribing fear due to restrictive legislation, 3. Care shifts and treatment gaps, and 4. Conversion to illicit substances. The clinicians recognized the harms of inappropriate prescribing and how this could affect their patients. Decreases in opioid prescribing were already occurring prior to the law implementation. Disciplinary actions against opioid prescribers resulted in prescriber fear, which was then exacerbated by SB 273 and contributed to shifts in care that led to forced tapering and opioid under-prescribing. Providers felt that taking on patients who legitimately required opioids could jeopardize their career. A holistic and patient-centered approach should be taken by legislative and disciplinary bodies to ensure patients are not abandoned when disciplinary actions are taken against prescribers or new legislation is passed.","Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Death;Fear;Humans;Inappropriate Prescribing;Interview;Law;Legislation;News;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Specialists;Therapeutics;Time;United States;West Virginia",Chronic Pain;Death;Opiate Overdose;Pain,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35315148,2022,Modeling the cost-effectiveness and impact on fatal overdose and initiation of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment at syringe service programs.,"To estimate the number of treatment initiations, averted fatal opioid overdoses and the cost-effectiveness associated with offering buprenorphine-naloxone (buprenorphine) treatment on-site within existing syringe service programs (SSPs) in Massachusetts, USA. This was a cohort-based mathematical model and cost-effectiveness analysis. We derived model inputs from state and national surveillance data, clinical trials and observational cohort studies. We compared an intervention scenario where 30% of SSP clients initiated buprenorphine treatment on-site at least once annually to a status quo scenario where no buprenorphine was available on-site among community treatment providers in Massachusetts, 2020-30. In individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) we assumed that 80% of SSP clients had recently injected drugs and that treatment within SSPs would have similar or improved retention compared with standard-of-care buprenorphine programs, but higher rates of active opioid use while in treatment. Number of treatment initiations (i.e. individuals began treatment on a medication for opioid use disorder or entered medically managed withdrawal), averted fatal opioid overdoses, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life-time discounted costs from a health sector and a limited societal perspective. The status quo scenario resulted in 23 051 fatal overdoses and 1 511 613 treatment initiations over a 10-year simulation period. An intervention scenario with on-site SSP buprenorphine treatment averted 4797 (-20.8%) fatal opioid overdoses and resulted in 129 359 (+8.6%) additional treatment initiations compared with the status quo. The intervention scenario was the dominating scenario: providing OUD treatment through Massachusetts SSPs cost less (-$3612 per person) with patients accumulating more QALYs (0.2 per person) compared with the status quo scenario. Offering buprenorphine treatment on-site within syringe service programs has the potential to decrease fatal overdoses substantially, improve treatment engagement and save on costs.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clients;Clinical Trial;Cohort Studies;Community;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis;Drug Overdose;Health;Humans;Injections;Life;Massachusetts;Mathematical Model;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Standard of Care;Syringes;Therapeutics;Time",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35315162,2022,Population-level impact of initiating pharmacotherapy and linking to care people with opioid use disorder at inpatient medically managed withdrawal programs: an effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are shown to reduce opioid use and the risk of overdose. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) who exit inpatient medically managed withdrawal programs (detox) without initiating MOUD and linking to outpatient care have high rates of overdose. While detox encounters provide a theoretical opportunity for MOUD initiation, this is not ubiquitous in the United States. We used simulation modeling to estimate the population-level health effects and cost-effectiveness of a policy encouraging MOUD initiation during inpatient detox encounters. We employed a dynamic population state-transition model to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using detox programs as venues for initiating MOUD in Massachusetts, United States. We compared standard of care, where no detox patients initiate MOUD or link to outpatient MOUD providers, to strategies of offering MOUD to detox patients and linking those patients to outpatient MOUD. Budgetary impact to the Massachusetts health-care sector, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and total counts and percentage differences of fatal overdoses prevented. Initiating MOUD in detox with perfect linkage to outpatient MOUD would reduce fatal overdoses by 4.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.3-5.9], at an ICER of $56 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared with the standard of care. With moderate linkage, fatal overdoses would be reduced by 2.3% (95% CI= 1.2-3.1) with an ICER of $78 500 per QALY gained, compared with standard of care. Budgetary increase to Massachusetts health-care spending ranged from 0.5-1%. A simulation model indicates that initiation of medications for opioid use disorder and linkage policies among detox patients in Massachusetts, USA could prevent fatal opioid overdoses in the opioid use disorder population and would be cost-effective from a health-care sector perspective.","Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Confidence Intervals;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis;Drug Overdose;Drug Therapy;Health;Health Care;Health Care Sector;Humans;Injections;Inpatients;Massachusetts;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Population Dynamics;Program;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Risk;Standard of Care;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35357599,2022,A national survey of state laws regarding medications for opioid use disorder in problem-solving courts.,"Problem-solving courts have the potential to help reduce harms associated with the opioid crisis. However, problem-solving courts vary in their policies toward medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), with some courts discouraging or even prohibiting MOUD use. State laws may influence court policies regarding MOUD; thus, we aimed to identify and describe state laws related to MOUD in problem-solving courts across the US from 2005 to 2019. We searched Westlaw legal software for regulations and statutes (collectively referred to as ""state laws"") in all US states and D.C. from 2005 to 2019 and included laws related to both MOUD and problem-solving courts in our analytic sample. We conducted a modified iterative categorization process to identify and analyze categories of laws related to MOUD access in problem-solving courts. Since 2005, nine states had laws regarding MOUD in problem-solving courts. We identified two overarching categories of state laws: 1) laws that prohibit MOUD bans, and 2) laws potentially facilitating access to MOUD. Seven states had laws that prohibit MOUD bans, such as laws prohibiting exclusion of participants from programs due to MOUD use or limiting the type of MOUD, dose or treatment duration. Four states had laws that could facilitate access to MOUD, such as requiring courts to make MOUD available to participants. Relatively few states have laws facilitating MOUD access and/or preventing MOUD bans in problem-solving courts. To help facilitate MOUD access for court participants across the US, model state legislation should be created. Additionally, future research should explore potential effects of state laws on MOUD access and health outcomes for court participants.",Buprenorphine;Duration of Therapy;Future;Health;Law;Legislation;Methadone;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Problem Solving;Program;Regulation;Research;Software;Surveys,Opioid Use Disorder,Health Justice,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35363270,2022,Longitudinal Analysis of Substance Use Disorder Symptom Severity at Age 18 Years and Substance Use Disorder in Adulthood.,"Although more than 1 in every 3 US individuals will develop a substance use disorder (SUD) in their lifetime, relatively little is known about the long-term sequelae of SUD symptoms from adolescence through adulthood. To evaluate the longitudinal associations between adolescents' SUD symptom severity with later medical use of prescription drugs (ie, opioids, sedatives, and tranquilizers), prescription drug misuse (PDM), and SUD symptoms at ages 35 to 50 years. Eleven cohorts of US 12th grade students were followed longitudinally from age 18 years (1976-1986) to age 50 years (2008-2018) in the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study. Baseline surveys were self-administered in classrooms, and follow-ups were conducted by mail. Data were analyzed from June 2021 to February 2022. Response to MTF study between 1976 and 2018. Sociodemographic variables were measured at baseline. All bivariate and multivariate analyses use attrition weights to adjust for attrition by age 50 years within the sample. SUD symptoms, prescription drug use, and PDM were measured at baseline and every follow-up. The sample of 5317 individuals was 51.2% female (2685 participants; 95% CI, 49.6%-52.6%) and 77.9% White (4222 participants; 95% CI, 77.6%-79.1%). Participants were surveyed beginning at age 18 years and ending at age 50 years. The baseline response rate ranged from 77% to 84%, and the 32-year retention rate was 53%. Most adolescents with most severe SUD symptoms at age 18 years had 2 or more SUD symptoms in adulthood (316 participants [61.6%]; 95% CI, 55.7%-66.9%), and this association held for baseline alcohol, cannabis, and other drug use disorder symptoms. Adolescents with the highest SUD symptom severity at age 18 years had the highest adjusted odds of prescription drug use and PDM in adulthood (4-5 symptoms, adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.32; ≥6 symptoms, adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11-2.16). The majority of adults using prescribed opioids, sedatives, or tranquilizers (568 participants [52.2%]; 95% CI, 48.4%-55.9%) in the past year had multiple SUD symptoms at age 18 years. These findings suggest that most adolescents with severe SUD symptoms do not transition out of symptomatic substance use, and the long-term sequelae for adolescents with more severe SUD symptoms are more deleterious than those for adolescents with no or low severity. Prescribers should be aware that many adults prescribed opioids, sedatives, or tranquilizers had multiple SUD symptoms during adolescence and require careful assessment and monitoring.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Baseline Survey;Cannabis;Drug Use Disorders;Female;Future;Humans;Hypnotics and Sedatives;Mail;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Sedatives;Self;Students;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Weights;Whites",Drug Use Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35395044,2022,Positive associations between cannabis and alcohol use polygenic risk scores and phenotypic opioid misuse among African-Americans.,"This study examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for lifetime cannabis and alcohol use were associated with misusing opioids, and whether sex differences existed in these relations in an urban, African-American sample. Data were drawn from three cohorts of participants (N = 1,103; 45% male) who were recruited in first grade as part of a series of elementary school-based, universal preventive intervention trials conducted in a Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. In young adulthood, participants provided a DNA sample and reported on whether they had used heroin or misused prescription opioids in their lifetime. Three substance use PRS were computed based on prior GWAS: lifetime cannabis use from Pasman et al. (2018), heavy drinking indexed via maximum number of drinks from Gelernter et al. (2019), and alcohol consumption from Kranzler et al. (2019). Higher PRS for lifetime cannabis use, greater heavy drinking, and greater alcohol consumption were associated with heightened risk for misusing opioids among the whole sample. Significant sex by PRS interactions were also observed such that higher PRS for heavy drinking and alcohol consumption were associated with a greater likelihood of opioid misuse among males, but not females. Our findings further elucidate the genetic contributions to misusing opioids by showing that the genetics of cannabis and alcohol consumption are associated with lifetime opioid misuse among young adults, though replication of our findings is needed.","Adult;African Americans;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cannabis;DNA, A-Form;Drinking;Female;Genetics;Hallucinogens;Heroin;Humans;Male;Mid-Atlantic Region;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescriptions;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Scores;Schools;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Substance Use;Young Adult",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,PLoS One,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

In this cross-sectional study, we used deidentified claims from approximately 90% of U.S. retail pharmacies (2017-2018) to examine the association of state policies with the odds of receiving buprenorphine treatment from an NP/PA versus a physician, overall and stratified by urban/rural status. From 2017 to 2018, the percentage of buprenorphine treatment episodes prescribed by NPs/PAs varied widely across states, from 0.4% in Alabama to 57.2% in Montana. Policies associated with greater odds of buprenorphine treatment from an NP/PA included full scope of practice (SOP) for NPs, full SOP for PAs, Medicaid pay parity for NPs (reimbursement at 100% of the fee-for-service physician rate), and Medicaid expansion. Although most findings with respect to policies were similar in urban and rural settings, the association of Medicaid expansion with NP/PA buprenorphine treatment was driven by rural counties.",Alabama;Association;Buprenorphine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Fee-for-Service Plans;Health Care;Humans;Medicaid;Montana;Nurse Practitioners;Opioid Use Disorder;Overall;Parity;Pharmacies;Physician Assistants;Physicians;Policy;Respect;Scope of Practice;Therapeutics;United States,Opioid Use Disorder,Med Care Res Rev,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35461085,2022,Young adult opioid misuse indicates a general tendency toward substance use and is strongly predicted by general substance use risk.,"To examine whether young adult opioid misuse reflects a general tendency toward substance use and is influenced by general substance use risk or whether it is a different phenomenon from other drug use. At ages 23 (2016) and 26 (2019), a panel of young adults (n = 3794 to 3833) in the United States self-reported their past-month substance use (opioid misuse, heavy drinking, cigarettes, cannabis) and substance-specific risk factors (perceptions of harm; approval of use; and use of each substance by friends and romantic partners). Structural equation models examined non-opioid and opioid-specific associations between latent risk and substance use factors. Opioid misuse and opioid-specific risk factors shared significant variance with latent substance use and latent substance use risk, respectively, which were strongly associated. A statistically significant residual correlation between opioid-specific risk and opioid misuse remained.

35512503,2022,Neighborhood social environment change in late adolescence predicts substance use in emerging adulthood.,"This study examines associations of changes in perceived and objective (census-based) neighborhood social environment variables during adolescence with alcohol and marijuana outcomes in emerging adulthood using two waves of data (2013-14 and 2019-20) from a cohort in Southern California (n = 1249). Increasing perceived disorganization predicted greater alcohol consequences and socialization with peers using marijuana. Decreasing objective neighborhood SES predicted fewer alcohol consequences and greater socialization with peers drinking alcohol. Unexpectedly, both decreasing and increasing perceived social cohesion predicted fewer alcohol consequences. Increasing perceived social cohesion predicted lower solitary alcohol use. Findings identify potential environmental targets to prevent substance use during the transition to emerging adulthood, but more research is warranted to understand the complex findings for alcohol consequences.",Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohols;Association;California;Cannabis;Censuses;Environment;Humans;Marijuana Smoking;Marijuana Use;Neighborhood;Peer Group;Research;Residence Characteristics;Social Cohesion;Social Environment;Socialization;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Marijuana Use;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Health Place,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

35626884,2022,Evaluating Providers' Prescription Opioid Instructions to Pediatric Patients.,"Receiving an opioid prescription during childhood increases the risk of hazardous prescription opioid (PO) use during emerging adulthood. Instruction on how to safely use POs plays an essential role in pediatric patients' capacity to utilize as well as to discontinue POs appropriately. This study aimed to evaluate pediatric PO label instructions provided to a large sample of pediatric outpatients. Data were extracted from the electronic healthcare records system identifying pediatric patients who received a PO between 2016 and 2019 from pediatric outpatient medical clinics were affiliated with a northwestern United States medical center and children's hospital. Pediatric patients (n = 12,613) between 0-17 years old who received a PO during outpatient care were included. Patients with chronic health conditions (e.g., cancer) or who received their PO from an inpatient medical setting were excluded. Patient demographics, medication instructions, associated diagnoses, and other prescription information (e.g., name of medication, dose, and quantity dispensed) were examined using automated text classification. Many label instructions did not include any indication/reason for use (20.8%). Virtually none of the POs (&amp;gt;99%) included instructions for how to reduce/wean off POs, contact information for questions about the POs, and/or instructions around how to dispose of the POs. Efforts are needed to ensure that pediatric PO instructions contain essential elements to improve comprehension of when and how to use POs for pediatric patients.","Adolescent;Ambulatory Care;Cancer;Child;Classification;Comprehension;Demography;Diagnosis;Electronics;Elements;Health;Health Care;Hospitals, Pediatric;Inpatients;Instruction;Names;Northwestern United States;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Pediatrics;Play;Prescriptions;Records;Risk;Role",Cancer,Children (Basel),New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35647581,2021,Assessment of State and Federal Health Policies for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.,"Federal and state governments implemented temporary strategies for providing access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Advocates hope many of these policies become permanent because of their potential to expand access to care. To consider the multitude of ways access to and utilization of treatment for individuals with OUD might have been expanded by state and federal policy so researchers can do a better job evaluating the effectiveness of specific policy approaches, which will depend on the interaction with other state policies. We summarize state-level policy data reported by government and nonprofit agencies that track health care regulations, specifically the Kaiser Family Foundation, Federation of State Medical Boards, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Academy of Physician Assistants, and the National Safety Council. Data were collected by these sources from September 2020 through January 2021. We examine heterogeneity in policy elements adopted across states during the COVID-19 pandemic in 4 key areas: telehealth, privacy, licensing, and medication for opioid use disorder. The analysis was conducted from March 2020 through January 2021. This cross-sectional study found that federal and state governments have taken important steps to ensure OUD treatment availability during the COVID-19 pandemic, but few states are comprehensive in their approach. Although all states and Washington, DC have adopted at least 1 telehealth policy, only 17 states have adopted telehealth policies that improve access to OUD treatment for new patients. Furthermore, only 9 states relaxed privacy laws, which influence the ability to use particular technology for telehealth visits. Similarly, all states have adopted at least 1 policy related to health care professional licensing permissions, but only 35 expanded the scope of practice laws for both physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Forty-four states expanded access to initiation and delivery of medication for OUD treatment. Together, no state has implemented all of these policies to comprehensively expand access to OUD treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. With considerable policy changes potentially affecting access to treatment and treatment retention for patients with OUD during the pandemic, evaluations must account for the variation in state approaches in related policy areas because the interactions between policies may limit the potential effectiveness of any single policy approach.",Ability;Academies;Access to Therapy;Association;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Cross-Sectional Studies;District of Columbia;Elements;Family;Foundations;Government;Health Care;Health Care Professionals;Health Policy;Hope;Humans;Law;Licensing;News;Nurse Practitioners;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Patients;Physician Assistants;Policy;Privacy;Regulation;Research Personnel;Safety;Scope of Practice;State Government;Technology;Telehealth;Therapeutics;Track;United States,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Health Forum,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35676719,2022,Expert views on state-level naloxone access laws: a qualitative analysis of an online modified-Delphi process.,"Expanding availability to naloxone is a core harm reduction strategy in efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In the US, state-level legislation is a prominent mechanism to expand naloxone availability through various venues, such as community pharmacies. This qualitative study aimed to identify and summarize the views of experts on state-level naloxone access laws. We conducted a three-round modified-Delphi process using the online ExpertLens platform. Participants included 46 key stakeholders representing various groups (advocates, healthcare providers, human/social service practitioners, policymakers, and researchers) with expertise naloxone access laws. Participants commented on the effectiveness and implementability of 15 state-level naloxone access laws (NALs). We thematically analyzed participant comments to summarize views on NALs overall and specific types of NAL. Participants commented that the effectiveness of NALs in reducing opioid-related mortality depends on their ability to make sustained, significant impacts on population-level naloxone availability. Participants generally believed that increased naloxone availability does not have appreciable negative impacts on the prevalence of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and non-fatal opioid overdoses. Implementation barriers include stigma among the general public, affordability of naloxone, and reliance on an inequitable healthcare system. Experts believe NALs that significantly increase naloxone access are associated with less overdose mortality without risking substantial unintended public health outcomes. To maximize impacts, high-value NALs should explicitly counter existing healthcare system inequities, address stigmatization of opioid use and naloxone, maintain reasonable prices for purchasing naloxone, and target settings beyond community pharmacies to distribute naloxone.","Ability;Address;Affordability;Analgesics, Opioid;Comment;Community Pharmacies;Drug Overdose;Harm Reduction;Health Care Systems;Health Personnel;Humans;Law;Legislation;Mortality;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pharmacy;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Prices;Public Health;Research Personnel;Social Work;Stigmatization",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Harm Reduct J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

To our knowledge, no published study has systematically identified and categorized state policy innovations for expanding MOUD utilization.Objective: We sought to identify and categorize state MOUD policy innovations.Methods: Within a stratified random sample of 16 U.S. states and Washington D.C. we searched for 2019 state statutes and regulations related to MOUD in Westlaw legal database. We then identified laws that appeared designed to increase MOUD utilization and categorized them using a template analysis approach.Results: We found 82 laws with one or more MOUD expansion policies. We identified six high-level MOUD expansion policy categories: 1) policies expanding the availability of waivered buprenorphine providers; 2) needs assessments and policies increasing public MOUD awareness; 3) criminal justice system policies; 4) Substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and sober living facility policies; 5) insurance policies; and 6) hospital policies. SUD treatment and housing facility policies, as well as insurance policies, were most common.Conclusions: Multipronged approaches are being pursued by several states to increase MOUD access. Our results can inform policymakers of MOUD expansion approaches in other jurisdictions. Policy categories can serve as the basis for policy variables for future analyses of policy effects.","Access To Medicines;Analgesics, Opioid;Awareness;Buprenorphine;Criminal Justice;Database;District of Columbia;Future;Gold;Health Services Accessibility;Hospitals;Housing;Humans;Insurance;Knowledge;Law;Methadone;Methods;Needs Assessment;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Policy;Regulation;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Washington",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
35947282,2022,Economic Evaluation Design within the HEAL Prevention Cooperative.,"The rapid rise in opioid misuse, disorder, and opioid-involved deaths among older adolescents and young adults is an urgent public health problem. Prevention is a vital part of the nation's response to the opioid crisis, yet preventive interventions for those at risk for opioid misuse and opioid use disorder are scarce. In 2019, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Preventing Opioid Use Disorder in Older Adolescents and Young Adults cooperative as part of its broader Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative ( https://heal.nih.gov/ ). The HEAL Prevention Cooperative (HPC) includes ten research projects funded with the goal of developing effective prevention interventions across various settings (e.g., community, health care, juvenile justice, school) for older adolescent and young adults at risk for opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD). An important component of the HPC is the inclusion of an economic evaluation by nine of these research projects that will provide information on the costs, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of these interventions. The HPC economic evaluation is integrated into each research project's overall design with start-up costs and ongoing delivery costs collected prospectively using an activity-based costing approach. The primary objectives of the economic evaluation are to estimate the intervention implementation costs to providers, estimate the cost-effectiveness of each intervention for reducing opioid misuse initiation and escalation among youth, and use simulation modeling to estimate the budget impact of broader implementation of the interventions within the various settings over multiple years. The HPC offers an extraordinary opportunity to generate economic evidence for substance use prevention programming, providing policy makers and providers with critical information on the investments needed to start-up prevention interventions, as well as the cost-effectiveness of these interventions relative to alternatives. These data will help demonstrate the valuable role that prevention can play in combating the opioid crisis.",Adolescent;Budgets;Community Health Care;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Death;Economic Evaluation;Economics;Goals;Investments;Justice;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Opioid Crisis;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Overall;Play;Policy Makers;Public Health;Relatives;Research;Risk;Role;Schools;Substance Use;Young Adult;Youth,Death;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use,Prev Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

One HPC objective is to compare intervention impacts on opioid misuse initiation, escalation, severity, and disorder and identify whether any HPC interventions are more effective than others for types of individuals. It provides a rare opportunity to prospectively harmonize measures across distinct outcomes studies. This paper describes the needs, opportunities, strategies, and processes that were used to harmonize HPC data. They are illustrated with a strategy to measure opioid use that spans the spectrum of opioid use experiences (termed involvement) and is composed of common ""anchor items"" ranging from initiation to symptoms of opioid use disorder.

36218944,2022,Expert Panel Consensus on State-Level Policies to Improve Engagement and Retention in Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.,"In the US, recent legislation and regulations have been considered, proposed, and implemented to improve the quality of treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). However, insufficient empirical evidence exists to identify which policies are feasible to implement and successfully improve patient and population-level outcomes. To examine expert consensus on the effectiveness and the ability to implement state-level OUD treatment policies. This qualitative study used the ExpertLens online platform to conduct a 3-round modified Delphi process to convene 66 stakeholders (health care clinicians, social service practitioners, addiction researchers, health policy decision-makers, policy advocates, and persons with lived experience). Stakeholders participated in 1 of 2 expert panels on 14 hypothetical state-level policies targeting treatment engagement and linkage, evidence-based and integrated care, treatment flexibility, and monitoring or support services. Participants rated policies in round 1, discussed results in round 2, and provided final ratings in round 3. Participants used 4 criteria associated with either the effectiveness or implementability to rate and discuss each policy. The effectiveness panel (n = 29) considered policy effects on treatment engagement, treatment retention, OUD remission, and opioid overdose mortality. The implementation panel (n = 34) considered the acceptability, feasibility, affordability, and equitability of each policy. We measured consensus using the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry analysis technique from the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method. Both panels reached consensus on all items. Experts viewed 2 policies (facilitated access to medications for OUD and automatic Medicaid enrollment for citizens returning from correctional settings) as highly implementable and highly effective in improving patient and population-level outcomes. Participants rated hub-and-spoke-type policies and provision of financial incentives to emergency departments for treatment linkage as effective; however, they also rated these policies as facing implementation barriers associated with feasibility and affordability. Coercive policies and policies levying additional requirements on individuals with OUD receiving treatment (eg, drug toxicology testing, counseling requirements) were viewed as low-value policies (ie, decreasing treatment engagement and retention, increasing overdose mortality, and increasing health inequities). The findings of this study may provide urgently needed consensus on policies for states to consider either adopting or deimplementing in their efforts to address the opioid overdose crisis.","Ability;Access To Medicines;Address;Affordability;Consensus;Counseling;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Health Care;Health Policy;Humans;Incentives;Legislation;Medicaid;Methods;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pliability;Policy;Population;Regulation;Research Personnel;Social Work;Therapeutics;Toxicology;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Health Forum,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

This study aimed to systematically compare engagement in virtual research recruitment between AYA in SUD treatment and AYA in behavioral health (BH) treatment. Study staff contacted patients ages 16-30 at three outpatient clinics to recruit them for a naturalistic longitudinal online study. Staff documented whether patients answered the phone, expressed interest in the study, answered questions regarding eligibility, and enrolled in the study. Overall, 18% (n = 117) of those contacted by phone enrolled in the study. The rate of AYA reached did not significantly differ between those in SUD treatment (51%) and those in BH treatment (55%). Among those who were reached, those in SUD and BH treatment did not significantly differ (all p &gt; 0.05) in rates of being interested in the study (SUD: 58%; BH: 49%), completing the phone screen (SUD: 46%; BH: 41%) or enrolling in the study (SUD: 33%; BH: 35%). Overall, we found that engaging AYA in SUD treatment in virtual naturalistic longitudinal research was no more difficult than engaging AYA seen in general behavioral health settings. Future research should examine generalizability of engagement in naturalistic research to other study designs and explore the continuity of this effect into study retention and completion.",Adolescent;Adult;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Behavior Therapy;Delivery of Health Care;Future;Health;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Overall;Patients;Psychiatry;Research;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult,Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Contemp Clin Trials,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
36337350,2022,"The role of increasing pharmacy and community distributed naloxone in the opioid overdose epidemic in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York City.","Naloxone distributed to people at risk for opioid overdose has been associated with reduced overdose death rates; however, associations of retail pharmacy-distributed naloxone with overdose mortality have not been evaluated. Our analytic cohort uses retail pharmacy claims data; three health departments' community distribution data; federal opioid overdose data; and American Community Survey data. Data were analyzed by 3-digit ZIP Code and calendar quarter-year (2016Q1-2018Q4), and weighted by population. We regressed opioid-related overdose mortality on retail-pharmacy and community naloxone distribution, and community-level demographics using a linear model, hypothesizing that areas with high overdose rates would have higher current levels of naloxone distribution but that increasing naloxone distribution from one quarter to the next would be associated with lower overdose. From Q1-2016 to Q4-2018, the unadjusted naloxone distribution rate increased from 97 to 257 kits per 100,000 persons, while the unadjusted opioid overdose mortality rate fell from 8.1 to 7.2 per 100,000 persons. The concurrent level of naloxone distribution (both pharmacy and community) was positively and significantly associated with fatal opioid overdose rates. We did not detect associations between change in naloxone distribution rates and overdose mortality. Naloxone distribution volumes were correlated with fatal opioid overdose, suggesting medication was getting to communities where it was needed most. Amid high rates of overdose driven by fentanyl in the drug supply, our findings suggest additional prevention, treatment, and harm reduction interventions are required-and dramatically higher naloxone volumes needed-to reverse the opioid overdose crisis in the US.",Association;Calendar;Community;Community Surveys;Death Rate;Demography;Epidemics;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Health;Linear Models;Massachusetts;Mortality;Naloxone;New York City;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacies;Population;Rhode Island;Risk;Role;Supplies;Therapeutics,Death;Opiate Overdose,Drug Alcohol Depend Rep,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

This article presents a conceptual framework for telehealth strategies that can be adopted to increase family involvement across a four-stage continuum of youth OUD treatment and recovery: Treatment Preparation, Treatment Initiation, Treatment Stabilization, OUD Recovery. It first identifies provider-delivered tele-interventions that can enhance OUD services in each of the four stages, including family outreach, family engagement, family-focused intervention, and family-focused recovery maintenance. It then introduces several types of direct-to-family tele-supports that can be used to supplement provider-delivered interventions. These include both synchronous tele-supports (remote interactions that occur in real time) such as helplines, peer-to-peer coaching, and online support groups; and asynchronous tele-supports (communications that occur without participants being simultaneously present) such as automated text messaging, self-directed internet-based courses, and digital web support.",Adolescent;Coaching;Communication;Family;Humans;Internet;Maintenance;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Peer Group;Self;Self-Help Groups;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Text Messaging;Therapeutics;Time;Youth,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Marital Fam Ther,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Like,

36203350,2023,How negative and positive constructs and comorbid conditions contribute to disability in chronic orofacial pain.,"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) symptoms develop into chronic pain for some patients, but the reasons for this are unclear. Psychosocial factors and chronic overlapping pain conditions are believed to contribute to the development of pain-related disability. We examined the role of jaw function, negative and positive psychological factors and chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) on pain-related disability whilst controlling for demographic variables. We collected demographics, medical and psychosocial history and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale, a measure of pain intensity and pain interference from 400 participants with chronic TMD. Structural equation modelling was used to assess a model of COPCs and the latent variables of psychological unease (pain catastrophizing, somatic symptoms and negative affect), positive valence factors (optimism and positive affect), jaw function (chewing, opening and expression limitation) and pain-related disability (pain intensity and pain interference) whilst controlling for demographic variables. We achieved good fit of a parsimonious model (root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.063 [90% CI] [0.051-0.075]), comparative fit index = 0.942, standard root-mean-square residual = 0.067. Jaw function was the strongest latent variable predictor, followed by psychological unease and COPCs suggesting resources focused on improving joint function, psychosocial support and management of COPCs will improve pain-related disability in TMDs.

Here, we show that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) orchestrates the acquisition and maintenance of opiate-associated memories via projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). PVT→CeA activity associates morphine reward to the environment, whereas transient inhibition of the PVT→NAc pathway during retrieval causes enduring protection against opiate-primed relapse. Using brain-wide activity mapping, we revealed distributed network activities that are altered in non-relapsing mice, which enabled us to find that activating the downstream NAc→lateral hypothalamus (LH) pathway also prevents relapse. These findings establish the PVT as a key node in the opiate-associated memory network and demonstrate the potential of targeting the PVT→NAc→LH pathway for treating opioid addiction.","Amygdala;Animals;Brain;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Cues;Environment;Hypothalamic Area, Lateral;Maintenance;Male;Memory;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Morphine;Neural Pathways;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid-Related Disorders;Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Projection;Relapse;Repetition Priming;Reward;Thalamus;Transients",Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Neuron,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

Between 2006, when the treatment program initially implemented this model, and 2020, the census of clients receiving methadone maintenance at the study site grew from 1431 to 4500. Participants were 31 addiction counselors employed at a treatment organization that implemented an open-access model to scale up MMT. We examined counselors' perceptions and experiences of working in programs that employed this model, using individual semi-structured interviews, which an interdisciplinary team audiotaped, transcribed, and systematically coded using grounded theory. The team reviewed themes and reconciled disagreements (rater agreement was 98%). We describe themes that more than 10% of participants reported. Counselors described perceived advantages of the open-access model for clients (e.g., ""individualized to client needs""), clinicians (e.g., ""fewer demands""), and the community (e.g., ""crime reduced""). Counselors also described perceived disadvantages of the open-access model for clinicians (e.g., ""uneven workload"") and clients (e.g., ""need for more intensive services for some clients""), as well as program-level concerns (e.g., ""perceived lack of structure"").

34096756,2022,Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor sleep among patients being withdrawn from opioids: Evidence of feasibility and utility.,"Sleep impairment is a common comorbid and debilitating symptom for persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). Research into underlying mechanisms and efficacious treatment interventions for OUD-related sleep problems requires both precise and physiologic measurements of sleep-related outcomes and impairment. This pilot examined the feasibility of a wireless sleep electroencephalography (EEG) monitor (Sleep Profiler™) to measure sleep outcomes and architecture among participants undergoing supervised opioid withdrawal. Sleep outcomes were compared to a self-reported sleep diary and opioid withdrawal ratings. Participants (n = 8, 100% male) wore the wireless EEG 85.6% of scheduled nights. Wireless EEG detected measures of sleep architecture including changes in total, NREM and REM sleep time during study phases, whereas the diary detected changes in wakefulness only. Direct comparisons of five overlapping outcomes revealed lower sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency and higher awakenings and time spent awake from the wireless EEG versus sleep diary. Associations were evident between wireless EEG and increased withdrawal severity, lower sleep efficiency, less time in REM and non-REM stages 1 and 2, and more hydroxyzine treatment; sleep diary was associated with total sleep time and withdrawal only. Data provide initial evidence that a wireless EEG is a feasible and useful tool for objective monitoring of sleep in persons experiencing acute opioid withdrawal. Data are limited by the small and exclusively male sample, but provide a foundation for using wireless EEG sleep monitors for objective evaluation of sleep-related impairment in persons with OUD in support of mechanistic and treatment intervention research.

34110889,2022,Sleep disturbance as a therapeutic target to improve opioid use disorder treatment.,"Sleep health is an important factor across several physical and mental health disorders, and a growing scientific consensus has identified sleep as a critical component of opioid use disorder (OUD), both in the active disease state and during OUD recovery. The goal of this narrative review is to collate the literature on sleep, opioid use, and OUD as a means of identifying therapeutic targets to improve OUD treatment outcomes. Sleep disturbance is common and often severe in persons with OUD, especially during opioid withdrawal, but also in persons on opioid maintenance therapies. There is ample evidence that sleep disturbances including reduced total sleep time, disrupted sleep continuity, and poor sleep quality often accompany negative OUD treatment outcomes. Sleep disturbances are bidirectionally associated with several other factors related to negative treatment outcomes, including chronic stress, stress reactivity, low positive affect, high negative affect, chronic pain, and drug craving. This constellation of outcome variables represents a more comprehensive appraisal of the quality of life and quality of recovery than is typically assessed in OUD clinical trials. To date, there are very few clinical trials or experimental studies aimed at improving sleep health in OUD patients, either as a means of improving stress, affect, and craving outcomes, or as a potential mechanistic target to reduce opioid withdrawal and drug use behaviors. As such, the direct impact of sleep improvement in OUD patients is largely unknown, yet mechanistic and clinical research suggests that therapeutic interventions that target sleep are a promising avenue to improve OUD treatment.

34380600,2021,Transcriptional Alterations in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and Nucleus Accumbens Implicate Neuroinflammation and Synaptic Remodeling in Opioid Use Disorder.,"Prevalence rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased dramatically, accompanied by a surge of overdose deaths. While opioid dependence has been extensively studied in preclinical models, an understanding of the biological alterations that occur in the brains of people who chronically use opioids and who are diagnosed with OUD remains limited. To address this limitation, RNA sequencing was conducted on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, regions heavily implicated in OUD, from postmortem brains in subjects with OUD. We performed RNA sequencing on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens from unaffected comparison subjects (n = 20) and subjects diagnosed with OUD (n = 20). Our transcriptomic analyses identified differentially expressed transcripts and investigated the transcriptional coherence between brain regions using rank-rank hypergeometric orderlap. Weighted gene coexpression analyses identified OUD-specific modules and gene networks. Integrative analyses between differentially expressed transcripts and genome-wide association study datasets using linkage disequilibrium scores assessed the genetic liability of psychiatric-related phenotypes in OUD. Rank-rank hypergeometric overlap analyses revealed extensive overlap in transcripts between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in OUD, related to synaptic remodeling and neuroinflammation. Identified transcripts were enriched for factors that control proinflammatory cytokine, chondroitin sulfate, and extracellular matrix signaling. Cell-type deconvolution implicated a role for microglia as a potential driver for opioid-induced neuroplasticity. Linkage disequilibrium score analysis suggested genetic liabilities for risky behavior, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and depression in subjects with OUD. Overall, our findings suggest connections between the brain's immune system and opioid dependence in the human brain.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Behavior;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;Cells;Chondroitin Sulfates;Comprehension;Cytokines;Dataset;Death;Depression;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Extracellular Matrix;Gene Regulatory Networks;Genes;Genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Immune System;Linkage Disequilibrium;Microglia;Neuronal Plasticity;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Persons;Phenotype;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;RNA-Seq;Role;Sequence Determinations, RNA",Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Biol Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
34459058,2022,Clinical correlates of drug-related dreams in opioid use disorder.,"Drug-related dreams are commonly reported by individuals in treatment for substance use disorders, which may be distressing. Existing evidence suggests that dream recollection may be influenced by clinically relevant phenomena, such as opioid use and withdrawal, general sleep disturbance, affective symptoms, and chronic pain. However, very few studies have explored drug-related dreams among individuals who screened positive for opioid use disorder (OUD). Adults recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) who screened positive for OUD (N = 154) completed a questionnaire about drug-related dreams, as well as measures assessing sleep, opioid use history, stress, anxiety, and chronic pain. χ2 analyses, one-way analysis of variance, and bivariate correlations, correcting for the false discovery rate, were used as appropriate to explore correlates of (1) recollecting a drug-related dream, and (2) experiencing post-dream craving and distress. Individuals who recollected a past-week drug-related dream were more likely to report other recent sleep disturbances, including poorer sleep quality, greater insomnia symptoms, and a higher risk for sleep apnea. Post-dream craving and distress were both associated with greater insomnia symptoms, poor sleep hygiene behaviors, and greater anxiety symptoms. Individuals who had ever experienced a drug-related dream (recently, or in their lifetime) were more likely to report a history of severe withdrawal, overdose, and intravenous opioid use. Drug-related dreams were common among individuals in the present sample and were related to other clinically relevant phenomena.

34569924,2022,Worsening sleep quality across the lifespan and persistent sleep disturbances in persons with opioid use disorder.,"Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) may experience worsening sleep quality over time, and a subset of individuals may have sleep disturbances that precede opioid use and do not resolve following abstinence. The purpose of the present study was to (1) collect retrospective reports of sleep across the lifespan and (2) identify characteristics associated with persistent sleep disturbance and changes in sleep quality in persons with OUD. Adults with OUD (n = 154) completed a cross-sectional study assessing current and past sleep disturbance, opioid use history, and chronic pain. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine changes in retrospectively reported sleep quality, and whether changes varied by screening positive for insomnia and/or chronic pain. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify additional correlates of persistent sleep disturbance. Participants reported that their sleep quality declined over their lifespan. Changes in reported sleep over time varied based on whether the individual screened positive for co-occurring insomnia and/or chronic pain. In regression analyses, female sex (β = 0.16, P = .042), a greater number of treatment episodes (β = 0.20, P = .024), and positive screens for chronic pain (β = 0.19, P = .018) and insomnia (β=0.22, P = .013) were associated with self-reported persistent sleep disturbance. Only a portion of participants who screened positive for sleep disorders had received a formal diagnosis. OUD treatment providers should routinely screen for co-occurring sleep disturbance and chronic pain. Interventions that treat co-occurring OUD, sleep disturbance, and chronic pain are needed.

35347109,2022,Molecular rhythm alterations in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens associated with opioid use disorder.,"Severe and persistent disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms are common in people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Preclinical evidence suggests altered molecular rhythms in the brain modulate opioid reward and relapse. However, whether molecular rhythms are disrupted in the brains of people with OUD remained an open question, critical to understanding the role of circadian rhythms in opioid addiction. Using subjects' times of death as a marker of time of day, we investigated transcriptional rhythms in the brains of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected comparison subjects. We discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in OUD, that were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected subjects. Fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected subjects, whereas in the NAc, nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts was identified in subjects with OUD. In NAc of subjects with OUD, rhythmic transcripts peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with an opioid, dopamine, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Associations with altered neurotransmission in NAc were further supported by co-expression network analysis which identified OUD-specific modules enriched for transcripts involved in dopamine, GABA, and glutamatergic synaptic functions. Additionally, rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc of subjects with OUD were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep-related GWAS traits, including sleep duration and insomnia. Collectively, our findings connect transcriptional rhythm changes in opioidergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic signaling in the human brain to sleep-related traits in opioid addiction.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Brain;Circadian Rhythm;Comprehension;Death;Dopamine;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Genomics;Humans;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Prefrontal Cortex;Relapse;Reward;Role;Sleep;Sleeplessness;Synaptic Transmission;Time;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse;Sleeplessness,Transl Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

So too do the associated adverse consequences. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic and relapsing brain disease characterized by loss of control over opioid use and impairments in cognitive function, mood, pain perception, and autonomic activity. Sleep deficiency, a term that encompasses insufficient or disrupted sleep due to multiple potential causes, including sleep disorders, circadian disruption, and poor sleep quality or structure due to other medical conditions and pain, is present in 75% of patients with OUD. Sleep deficiency accompanies OUD across the spectrum of this addiction. The focus of this concise clinical review is to highlight the bidirectional mechanisms between OUD and sleep deficiency and the potential to target sleep deficiency with therapeutic interventions to promote long-term, healthy recovery among patients in OUD treatment. In addition, current knowledge on the effects of opioids on sleep quality, sleep architecture, sleep-disordered breathing, sleep apnea endotypes, ventilatory control, and implications for therapy and clinical practice are highlighted. Finally, an actionable research agenda is provided to evaluate the basic mechanisms of the relationship between sleep deficiency and OUD and the potential for behavioral, pharmacologic, and positive airway pressure treatments targeting sleep deficiency to improve OUD treatment outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Architecture;Brain Diseases;Cognition;Humans;Knowledge;Lung;Mood;Morphine;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Perception;Patients;Pressure;Research;Respiratory Physiological Phenomena;Review;Sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Wake Disorders;Sleep-Disordered Breathing;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Brain Diseases;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Wake Disorders;Sleep-Disordered Breathing,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,

36053258,2022,"Sex-specific role of the circadian transcription factor NPAS2 in opioid tolerance, withdrawal and analgesia.","Opioids like fentanyl remain the mainstay treatment for chronic pain. Unfortunately, opioid's high dependence liability has led to the current opioid crisis, in part, because of side-effects that develop during long-term use, including analgesic tolerance and physical dependence. Both tolerance and dependence to opioids may lead to escalation of required doses to achieve previous therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, altered sleep and circadian rhythms are common in people on opioid therapy. Opioids impact sleep and circadian rhythms, while disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms likely mediate the effects of opioids. However, the mechanisms underlying these bidirectional relationships between circadian rhythms and opioids remain largely unknown. The circadian protein, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), regulates circadian-dependent gene transcription in structure of the central nervous system that modulate opioids and pain. Here, male and female wild-type and NPAS2-deficient (NPAS2-/-) mice were used to investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl analgesia, tolerance, hyperalgesia and physical dependence. Overall, thermal pain thresholds, acute analgesia and tolerance to a fixed dose of fentanyl were largely similar between wild-type and NPAS2-/- mice. However, female NPAS2-/- exhibited augmented analgesic tolerance and significantly more behavioral symptoms of physical dependence to fentanyl. Only male NPAS2-/- mice had increased fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity, when compared with wild-type males. Together, our findings suggest sex-specific effects of NPAS2 signaling in the regulation of fentanyl-induced tolerance, hyperalgesia and dependence.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors;Behavioral Symptoms;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Circadian Rhythm;Drug Tolerance;Female;Fentanyl;Genes;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Lead;Male;Mice;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Threshold;Persons;Protein Domains;Proteins;Regulation;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Sleep;Therapeutics;Transcription Factors",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Pain,Genes Brain Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Like,
32856490,2022,Current Strategies for the Management of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy.,"The development of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication of chronic diabetes that can be associated with significant disability and healthcare costs. Prompt symptom identification and aggressive glycemic control is essential in controlling the development of neuropathic complications; however, adequate pain relief remains challenging and there are considerable unmet needs in this patient population. Although guidelines have been established regarding the pharmacological management of PDN, pain control is inadequate or refractory in a high proportion of patients. Pharmacotherapy with anticonvulsants (pregabalin, gabapentin) and antidepressants (duloxetine) are common first-line agents. The use of oral opioids is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and can also lead to opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Their use is therefore discouraged. There is an emerging role for neuromodulation treatment modalities including intrathecal drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation, and dorsal root ganglion stimulation. Furthermore, consideration of holistic alternative therapies such as yoga and acupuncture may augment a multidisciplinary treatment approach. This aim of this review is to focus on the current management strategies for the treatment of PDN, with a discussion of treatment rationale and practical considerations for their implementation.","Acupuncture;Alternative Therapies;Anticonvulsants;Antidepressive Agents;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Drug Therapy;Duloxetine;Gabapentin;Ganglia, Spinal;Glycemic Control;Guideline;Health Care Costs;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Lead;Morbidity;Mortality;Needs;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Pregabalin;Review;Role;Spinal Cord Stimulation;Therapeutics;Yoga",Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Pain,J Diabetes Sci Technol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
33067413,2020,Spinal cord stimulation and rehabilitation in an individual with chronic complete L1 paraplegia due to a conus medullaris injury: motor and functional outcomes at 18 months.,"Epidural electrical stimulation of the conus medullaris has helped facilitate native motor recovery in individuals with complete cervicothoracic spinal cord injuries (SCI). A theorized mechanism of clinical improvement includes supporting central pattern generators intrinsic to the conus medullaris. Because spinal cord stimulators (SCS) are approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain, we were able to test this experimental therapy in a subject with complete L1 paraplegia and neuropathic genital pain due to a traumatic conus injury. An otherwise healthy 48-year-old male with chronic complete L1 paraplegia with no zones of partial preservation (ZPP) and intractable neuropathic genital pain presented to our group seeking nonmedical pain relief and any possible help with functional restoration. After extensive evaluation, discussion, and consent, we proceeded with SCS implantation at the conus and an intensive outpatient physical therapy regimen consistent with the recent SCI rehabilitation literature. Intraoperatively, no electromyography (EMG) could be elicited with epidural conus stimulation. At 18 months after implantation, his motor ZPPs had advanced from L1 to L5 on the left and from L1 to L3 on the right. Qualitative increases in lower extremity resting state EMG amplitudes were noted, although there was no consistent evidence of voluntary EMG or rhythmic locomotive leg movements. Three validated functional and quality of life (QoL) surveys demonstrated substantial improvements. The modest motor response compared to the literature suggests likely critical differences in the anatomy of such a low injury. However, the change in ZPPs and QoL suggest potential for neuroplasticity even in this patient population.","Anatomy;Central Pattern Generators;Conus Medullaris;Conus Snail;Electric Stimulation;Electromyography;Genitalia;Humans;Injuries;Leg;Literature;Lower Extremity;Male;Middle Aged;Movement;Natives;Neuralgia;Neuronal Plasticity;Outpatients;Pain;Paraplegia;Patients;Physical Therapy;Population;Quality of Life;Rehabilitation;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Injuries;Spinal Cord Stimulation;Surveys;Therapeutics;Therapies, Investigational",Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Paraplegia;Spinal Cord Injuries,Spinal Cord Ser Cases,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

Purkinje cell damage and hyperalgesia have been demonstrated in transgenic sickle mice. Purkinje cells are associated with movement and neural function which may influence pain. We hypothesized that Purkinje cell damage and/or chronic pain burden provoke compensatory gait changes in sickle mice. We found that Purkinje cells undergoe increased apoptosis as shown by caspase-3 activation. Using an automated gait measurement system, MouseWalker, we characterized spatiotemporal gait characteristics of humanized transgenic BERK sickle mice in comparison to control mice. Sickle mice showed alteration in stance instability and dynamic gait parameters (walking speed, stance duration, swing duration and specific swing indices). Differences in stance instability may reflect motor dysfunction due to damaged Purkinje cells. Alterations in diagonal and all stance indices indicative of hesitation during walking may originate from motor dysfunction and/or arise from fear and/or anticipation of movement-evoked pain. We also demonstrate that stance duration, diagonal swing indices and all stance indices correlate with both mechanical and deep tissue hyperalgesia, while stance instability correlates with only deep tissue hyperalgesia. Therefore, objective analysis of gait in SCD may provide insights into neurological impairment and pain states.","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Apoptosis;Brain;Caspase 3;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Fear;Gait;Gene Knockout Techniques;Hemoglobinopathies;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Movement;Pain;Phenotype;Purkinje Cells;Tissues;Walkers;Walking;Walking Speed;alpha-Globins;beta-Globins","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hemoglobinopathies;Hyperalgesia;Pain",Front Immunol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

This pain may be managed conservatively, with repositioning of the battery and, in some cases, with explant. Here we explore our experience with management of generator site pain (""pocket pain"") in a large single-center study. All SCS permanent implants and implantable pulse generator (IPG) placements over 9 years were reviewed. Of 785 cases, we identified 43 patients with pocket pain (5.5%). Demographics and treatments of the pocket pain cohort were analyzed. The mean age (± SEM) of the pocket pain cohort was 46.86 ± 1.06, and there were 10/33 males/females. Females were overrepresented in pocket pain cohort (76.7%) when compared with the total SCS cohort (59.0%) (X2 = 5.93, P = 0.015). Diagnosis included failed back surgery syndrome (51.2%), complex regional pain syndrome (23.3%), and chronic neuropathic pain (25.5%). No patients improved with conservative therapy. All patients either went on to revision (n = 23) or explant (n = 20). Time from initial surgery to development of pocket pain was 7.5 months (range: 0.3-88) and from pocket pain to revision surgery was 4.5 months (range: 0.4-26). In addition, significantly more pocket pain patients (65.1%) had workers' compensation (WC) insurance compared with patients without pocket pain (24.9%) (X2 = 33.3, P &lt; 0.001). In our institutional experience, pocket pain was inadequately managed with conservative treatments. Being female and having SCS filed under WC increased risk of pocket pain.

Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD.

Here, we provide a critical review of the literature that highlights the intersection in brain networks between chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depression and discuss findings from previous deep brain stimulation (DBS) studies for pain. Based on a multidimensional model of pain processing and the connectivity of the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) with areas that are implicated in both CLBP and depression, we propose a novel approach to the treatment of CLBP using DBS of the SCC. A narrative review with literature assessment. CLBP is associated with a shift away from somatosensory representation toward brain regions that mediate emotional processes. There is a high degree of overlap between these regions and those involved in depression, including the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala. Whereas targets sites from previous DBS trials for pain were not anatomically positioned to engage these areas and their associated networks, the SCC is structurally connected to all of these regions and as well as others involved in mediating sensory, cognitive, and affective processing in CLBP. CLBP and depression share a common underlying brain network interconnected by the SCC.

34630868,2021,Recruitment of Primary Afferents by Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation using the Injectrode.,"Chronic pain affects millions of people in the United States and pharmacological treatments have been ineffective. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation is a neuromodulation method that delivers electrical stimulation to the DRG to relieve pain. DRG electrodes are rigid and cylindrical. The implantation of DRG electrodes requires a technically-challenging surgery that involves steering electrodes laterally towards the DRG. The Injectrode is an injectable conductive polymer that cures in place and is capable of delivering electrical current to stimulate neural tissue. We used the Injectrode to stimulate the L6 and L7 DRG in cats, measuring neural responses evoked in the sciatic, tibial, and common peroneal nerves to measure the thresholds for activating fibers. A cylindrical stainless-steel electrode was used for comparison. Thresholds were 38% higher with the Injectrode versus stainless-steel, likely owing to its larger contact surface area with the DRG. Both Aα and Aβ sensory fibers were activated using DRG stimulation. The Injectrode has the potential to offer a new and simple method for DRG stimulation that can potentially offer more complete coverage of the DRG.","A Fibers;Affect;Cats;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Ganglia, Spinal;General Surgery;Injectables;Measures;Methods;News;Pain;Peroneal Nerve;Persons;Polymers;Stainless Steel;Therapeutics;Tissues;United States",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Pain,Int IEEE EMBS Conf Neural Eng,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
34892428,2021,Rapid Visualization Tool for Intraoperative Dorsal Column Mapping Triggered by Spinal Cord Stimulation in Chronic Pain Patients.,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a widely accepted effective treatment for managing chronic pain. SCS outcomes depend highly on accurate placement of SCS electrodes at the appropriate spine level for a desired pain relief. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) under general anesthesia provides an objective real-time mapping of the dorsal columns, and has been shown to be a safe and effective tool. IONM applies stimulation to multiple electrode contacts at various intensities and monitors the triggered electromyography (EMG) responses in several muscle groups simultaneously. Therefore, it requires dynamic communication between neurosurgeon and neurophysiologist and continuous real-time annotations of the responses, which makes the procedure complex and experience-based. Here, we describe an automated data visualization tool that generates patient specific activity maps using intraoperatively collected signals. Responses were collected using a High-resolution (HR)-SCS lead with 8 columns of electrodes spanning the dorsal columns. Our JavaScript/Python based graphical user interface (GUI) provides a fast and robust visualization of EMG activity via denoising, feature extraction, normalization, and overlaying of the activity maps on body images in selected colormaps. In contrast to reviewing series of EMG signals, our user-friendly tool provides a rapid and robust analysis of stimulation effects on various muscle groups and direct comparison across subjects and/or stimulation settings.

Recently available DBS devices can sense neural signals which, in turn, can be used to control stimulation in a closed-loop mode. Closed-loop DBS strategies may mitigate many drawbacks of open-loop stimulation and provide more personalized therapy. These devices contain many adjustable parameters that control how the closed-loop system operates, which need to be optimized using a combination of empirically and clinically informed decision making. We offer a practical guide for the implementation of a closed-loop DBS system, using examples from patients with chronic pain. Focusing on two research devices from Medtronic, the Activa PC+S and Summit RC+S, we provide pragmatic details on implementing closed- loop programming from a clinician's perspective. Specifically, by combining our understanding of chronic pain with data-driven heuristics, we describe how to tune key parameters to handle feature selection, state thresholding, and stimulation artifacts. Finally, we discuss logistical and practical considerations that clinicians must be aware of when programming closed-loop devices.",Artifacts;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Decision Making;Deep Brain Stimulation;Devices;Heuristics;Needs;Patients;Physiology;Research;Therapeutics,Chronic Pain,Front Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,
35876669,2022,High-Resolution Spinal Motor Mapping Using Thoracic Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With Chronic Pain.,"High-resolution spinal cord stimulation (HR-SCS) paddle can stimulate medial-dorsal columns and extend stimulation coverage to the laterally positioned spinal targets. To investigate the medio-lateral selectivity of an HR-SCS paddle in patients with chronic pain. During standard-of-care spinal cord stimulation (SCS) placement, epidurally evoked electromyography and antidromic dorsal column-evoked potentials were recorded in 12 subjects using an HR-SCS paddle with 8 medio-lateral sites spanning the full epidural width at thoracic T9-12 and a commercial paddle consecutively. Recruitment maps were aligned with respect to physiological midline which was overlapping with anatomic midline in 10 of 11 cases. Overlapping contacts between the HR-SCS and commercial paddles exhibited similar patterns while HR-SCS demonstrated higher precision targeting of certain dermatomes. Spinal motor maps showed that the lateral contacts triggered stronger responses in medial gastrocnemius, adductor magnus, and tibialis anterior while the medial contacts triggered stronger responses in gluteus maximus and adductor hallucis. The time-locked popliteal fossa responses indicated ipsilateral activation by HR-SCS at the lateral contacts and bilateral activation at the medial contacts with stronger ipsilateral responses. This study is the first to perform high-resolution medio-lateral SCS mapping in patients with chronic pain. These results show promise that HR-SCS may provide additional ipsilateral recruitment within the extremities which improve targeting of focal pain in the lower extremities. Furthermore, this study supports the functional use of intraoperative neuromonitoring as a decision tool to determine physiological midline in thoracic SCS surgeries and provides a full methodological framework.",Chronic Pain;Electromyography;Epidural Space;Evoked Potentials;Extremities;General Surgery;Humans;Lower Extremity;Map;Neurosurgical Procedures;Pain;Patients;Respect;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Stimulation;Standard of Care;Time,Chronic Pain;Pain,Neurosurgery,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Like,

29533926,2018,Reducing CXCR4-mediated nociceptor hyperexcitability reverses painful diabetic neuropathy.,"Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is an intractable complication of diabetes that affects 25% of patients. PDN is characterized by neuropathic pain and small-fiber degeneration, accompanied by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor hyperexcitability and loss of their axons within the skin. The molecular mechanisms underlying DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability and small-fiber degeneration in PDN are unknown. We hypothesize that chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is central to this mechanism, as we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is necessary for the development of mechanical allodynia, a pain hypersensitivity behavior common in PDN. Focusing on DRG neurons expressing the sodium channel Nav1.8, we applied transgenic, electrophysiological, imaging, and chemogenetic techniques to test this hypothesis. In the high-fat diet mouse model of PDN, we were able to prevent and reverse mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration by limiting CXCR4 signaling or neuronal excitability. This study reveals that excitatory CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia and small-fiber degeneration in a mouse model of PDN. Hence, we propose that targeting CXCR4-mediated DRG nociceptor hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic approach for disease-modifying treatments for this currently intractable and widespread affliction.","Affect;Animals;Axons;Behavior;Chemokine CXCL12;Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Diet, High-Fat;Disease;Ganglia, Spinal;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurosciences;Nociceptors;Pain;Patients;Play;Receptors, CXCR4;Role;Signal Transduction;Skin;Sodium Channels;Therapeutics","Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain",J Clin Invest,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Druggable Genome
32311372,2020,Targeting neurotrophic factors: Novel approaches to musculoskeletal pain.,"Chronic pain represents a substantial unmet medical need globally. In recent years, the quest for a new generation of novel, safe, mechanism-based analgesic treatments has focused on neurotrophic factors, a large group of secreted proteins that control the growth and survival of different populations of neurons, but that postnatally are involved in the genesis and maintenance of pain, with biological activity in both the periphery and the central nervous system. In this narrative review, we discuss the two families of neurotrophic proteins that have been extensively studied for their role in pain: first, the neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived growth factor (BDNF), and secondly, the GDNF family of ligands (GFLs). We provide an overview of the pain pathway, and the pain-producing effects of these different proteins. We summarize accumulating preclinical and clinical findings with a focus on musculoskeletal pain, and on osteoarthritis in particular, because the musculoskeletal system is the most prevalent source of chronic pain and of disability, and clinical testing of these novel agents - often biologics- is most advanced in this area.",Analgesics;Animals;Biopharmaceuticals;Brain;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Drug Development;Family;Generations;Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Growth;Growth Factors;Humans;Ligands;Maintenance;Musculoskeletal Pain;Musculoskeletal System;Needs;Nerve Growth Factor;Nerve Growth Factors;Neurons;News;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Population;Proteins;Review;Role;Survival;Therapeutics,Chronic Pain;Musculoskeletal Pain;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Pharmacol Ther,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Druggable Genome
32483055,2020,Pain-related behaviors and abnormal cutaneous innervation in a murine model of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in one of the type V collagen-encoding genes, COL5A1 or COL5A2. cEDS is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and instability, hyperextensible, fragile skin, and delayed wound healing. Chronic pain is a major problem in cEDS patients, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, and studies in animal models are lacking. Therefore, we assessed pain-related behaviors in haploinsufficient Col5a1 mice, which clinically mimic human cEDS. Compared to wild-type (WT) littermates, 15 to 20-week-old Col5a1 mice of both sexes showed significant hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli in the hind paws and the abdominal area, but responses to thermal stimuli were unaltered. Spontaneous behaviors, including distance travelled and rearing, were grossly normal in male Col5a1 mice, whereas female Col5a1 mice showed altered climbing behavior. Finally, male and female Col5a1 mice vocalized more than WT littermates when scruffed. Decreased grip strength was also noted. In view of the observed pain phenotype, Col5a1 mice were crossed with NaV1.8-tdTomato reporter mice, enabling visualization of nociceptors in the glabrous skin of the footpad. We observed a significant decrease in intraepidermal nerve fiber density, with fewer nerves crossing the epidermis, and a decreased total nerve length of Col5a1 mice compared to WT. In summary, male and female Col5a1 mice show hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli, indicative of generalized sensitization of the nervous system, in conjunction with an aberrant organization of cutaneous nociceptors. Therefore, Col5a1 mice will provide a useful tool to study mechanisms of pain associated with cEDS.","Animals;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Collagen Type V;Connective Tissue;Disease Models, Animal;Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome;Epidermis;Female;Genes;Grip;Humans;Hypermobility, Joint;Hypersensitivity;Male;Mice;Models, Animal;Mutation;Nerve Fibers;Nervous System;Nociceptors;Organizations;Pain;Patients;Phenotype;Sex;Skin;Tomatoes;Wound Healing","Chronic Pain;Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome;Hypermobility, Joint;Hypersensitivity;Pain;Wounds",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Druggable Genome
34797601,2021,"Pain in the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: Mechanisms, models, and challenges.","Chronic pain is one of the most common, yet poorly studied, complaints in people suffering from Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). This heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders is typically characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and generalized connective tissue fragility. Most EDS types are caused by genetic defects that affect connective tissue biosynthesis, thereby compromising collagen biosynthesis or fibrillogenesis and resulting in a disorganized extracellular matrix. Even though chronic pain is a major source of disability, functional impairment, and psychosocial suffering in EDS, currently used analgesics and other treatment strategies provide inadequate pain relief and thus represents an important unmet medical need. An important contributor to this is the lack of knowledge about the underlying mechanisms. In this narrative review, we summarize the current understanding of pain and the associated mechanisms in EDS based on clinical studies focusing on questionnaires and experimental pain testing as well as studies in animal models of EDS.

34109308,2021,Opioid use disorder and health service utilization among COVID-19 patients in the US: A nationwide cohort from the Cerner Real-World Data.,"Both opioid use and COVID-19 affect respiratory and pulmonary health, potentially putting individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD) at risk for complications from COVID-19. We examine the relationship between OUD and subsequent hospitalization, length of stay, risk for invasive ventilator dependence (IVD), and COVID-19 mortality. Multivariable logistic and exponential regression models using electronic health records data from the Cerner COVID-19 De-Identified Data Cohort from January through June 2020. Out of 52,312 patients with COVID-19, 1.9% (n=1,013) had an OUD. COVID-19 patients with an OUD had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=3.44, 95% CI=2.81-4.21), maximum length of stay ( e β ^   =1.16, 95% CI=1.09-1.22), and odds of IVD (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06-1.49) than patients without an OUD, but did not differ with respect to COVID-19 mortality. However, OUD patients under age 45 exhibited greater COVID-19 mortality (aOR=3.23, 95% CI=1.59-6.56) compared to patients under age 45 without an OUD. OUD patients using opioid agonist treatment (OAT) exhibited higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=5.14, 95% CI=2.75-10.60) and higher maximum length of stay ( e β ^   =1.22, 95% CI=1.01-1.48) than patients without OUDs; however, risk for IVD and COVID-19 mortality did not differ. OUD patients using naltrexone had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=32.19, 95% CI=4.29-4,119.83), higher maximum length of stay ( e β ^   =1.59, 95% CI=1.06-2.38), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=3.15, 95% CI=1.04-9.51) than patients without OUDs, but mortality did not differ. OUD patients who did not use treatment medication had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=4.05, 95% CI=3.32-4.98), higher maximum length of stay ( e β ^   =1.14, 95% CI=1.08-1.21), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=1.25, 95% CI=1.04-1.50) and COVID-19 mortality (aOR=1.31, 95% CI=1.07-1.61) than patients without OUDs.

32353544,2020,Medication treatment for opioid use disorder in expectant mothers (MOMs): Design considerations for a pragmatic randomized trial comparing extended-release and daily buprenorphine formulations.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has increased significantly in recent years. Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6-30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment. This paper describes the key design decisions for the main trial made during protocol development. This Investigational New Drug (IND) trial uniquely uses pragmatic features where feasible in order to maximize external validity, hence increasing the potential to inform clinical practice guidelines and address multiple knowledge gaps for treatment of this patient population.","Address;Administration, Sublingual;Arm;Buprenorphine;Clinical Practice Guideline;Clinical Trial;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Abuse;Drugs, Investigational;Economics;Evidence-Based Practice;Female;Gestational Age;Humans;Infant;Knowledge;Mothers;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Paper;Patients;Population;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Random Allocation;Randomized Controlled Trial;Relatives;Research Design;Therapeutics;Time;Women",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Contemp Clin Trials,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Admin Supplement: Strategies to reduce stigma;Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Enhancing the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network to Address O;Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33165146,2021,"Service Involvement Across Multiple Sectors Among People Who Use Opioids, Methamphetamine, or Both, United States-2015-2018.","The fourth wave of the opioid crisis is characterized by increased use and co-use of methamphetamine. How opioid and methamphetamine co-use is associated with health care use, housing instability, social service use, and criminal justice involvement has not been studied and could inform future interventions and partnerships. To estimate service involvement across sectors among people who reported past year opioid and methamphetamine co-use, methamphetamine use, opioid use, or neither opioid nor methamphetamine use. We examined 2015-2018 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We used multivariable negative binomial and logistic regression models and predictive margins, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Nonelderly US adults aged 18 or older. Hospital days, emergency department visits, housing instability, social service use, and criminal justice involvement in the past year. In adjusted analyses, adults who reported opioid and methamphetamine co-use had 99% more overnight hospital days, 46% more emergency department visits, 2.1 times more housing instability, 1.4 times more social service use, and 3.3 times more criminal justice involvement compared with people with opioid use only. People who used any methamphetamine, with opioids or alone, were significantly more likely be involved with services in 2 or more sectors compared with those who used opioids only (opioids only: 11.6%; methamphetamine only: 19.8%; opioids and methamphetamine: 27.6%). Multisector service involvement is highest among those who use both opioids and methamphetamine, suggesting that partnerships between health care, housing, social service, and criminal justice agencies are needed to develop, test, and implement interventions to reduce methamphetamine-related morbidity.","Adult;Aged;Amphetamine-Related Disorders;Criminal Justice;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Future;Health;Health Care;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Housing;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Primary Health Care;Social Work;Surveys;Time;United States;Young Adult",Amphetamine-Related Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders,Med Care,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Strategies to reduce stigma;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Optimizing Care for People with OUD and Mental Health Conditions;Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
34225785,2021,Financial sustainability of payment models for office-based opioid treatment in outpatient clinics.,"Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) is a delivery model which seeks to make medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), particularly buprenorphine, widely available in general medical clinics and offices. Despite evidence supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, uptake of the OBOT model has been relatively slow. One important barrier to faster diffusion of OBOT may be the financial challenges facing clinics that could adopt it. We review key features and variants of the OBOT model, then discuss different approaches that have been used to fund it, and the findings from previous economic analyses of OBOT's impact on organizational finances. We conclude by discussing the implications of these analyses for the financial sustainability of the OBOT delivery model. Like other novel services, OBOT poses challenges for providers due to its reliance on services which are 'non-billable' in a fee-for-service environment. A variety of approaches exist for covering the non-billable costs, but which approaches are feasible depends on local payer policies. The scale of the challenges varies with clinic size, organizational affiliations and the policies of the state where the clinic operates. Small clinics in a purely fee-for-service environment may be particularly challenged in pursuing OBOT, given the need to fund a dedicated staff and extra administrative work. The current pandemic may pose both opportunities and challenges for the sustainability of OBOT, with expanded access to telemedicine, but also uncertainty about the durability of the expansion. The reimbursement environment for OBOT delivery varies widely around the US, and is evolving as Medicare (and possibly other payers) introduce alternative payment approaches. Clinics considering adoption of OBOT are well advised to thoroughly investigate these issues as they make their decision. In addition, payers will need to rethink how they pay for OBOT to make it sustainable.","Adoption;Aged;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Diffusion;Economics;Environment;Fee-for-Service Plans;Financial Stress;Funds;Humans;Medicaid;Medicare;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizational Affiliation;Pandemics;Policy;Primary Health Care;Review;Scales;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Uncertainty;United States;Work",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Strategies to reduce stigma;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Optimizing Care for People with OUD and Mental Health Conditions
34373169,2022,Did drug use increase following COVID-19 relaxation of methadone take-out regulations? 2020 was a complicated year.,"Relaxation of federal regulations for methadone take-out dosing during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. The impact of this change on drug use is unknown. This study explores the impact of the federal take-out variance on drug use in one urban opioid treatment program as measured by drug testing. This study collected drug test results from 613 patients receiving methadone from July 2020, following COVID-19-related take-out dose adjustments, and July 2019 for comparison. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we computed the average estimated probability of a positive drug test for each year for each take-out phase. To isolate the effect of changing take-out, we removed the main effect of year, while retaining the main effect of take-out phase and the interaction between year and phase. The percent of drug tests positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and methamphetamine was greater in July 2020 than in July 2019 (p &lt; 0.001 for each), while the percent of tests negative for methadone increased (p &lt; 0.001). Oxycodone, barbiturate, and cocaine positive tests remained stable. In a separate analysis of opioid and non-opioid test results, take-out phase was associated with both opioid and non-opioid positive results (p &lt; 0.001, each outcome). The association of take-out phase with opioid and non-opioid positive results differed in the two years (year-by-phase interaction p &lt; 0.025, each outcome). After removing the year main effect, the rate of positive tests was lower in 2020 for the smallest number of take-out doses, higher for a moderate number of take-out doses, and about the same for the highest number of take-out doses. Positive opioid and non-opioid drug tests increased following the federal variance allowing more methadone take-out doses, but these findings cannot fully be attributed to alterations in the take-out schedule.","Adjustment;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Barbiturates;Benzodiazepines;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Cocaine;Humans;Methadone;Methamphetamine;Opiate Alkaloids;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pandemics;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Probability;Program;Regulation;Relaxation;SARS-CoV-2;Schedules;Therapeutics",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Strategies to reduce stigma;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Optimizing Care for People with OUD and Mental Health Conditions
30577898,2019,Interpretation and integration of the federal substance use privacy protection rule in integrated health systems: A qualitative analysis.,"Federal regulations (42 CFR Part 2) provide special privacy protections for persons seeking treatment for substance use disorders. Primary care providers, hospitals, and health care organizations have struggled to balance best practices for medical care with adherence to 42 CFR Part 2, but little formal research has examined this issue. The aim of this study was to explore institutional variability in the interpretation and implementation of 42 CFR Part 2 regulations related to health systems data privacy practices, policies, and information technology architecture. This was a cross-sectional qualitative study using purposive sampling to conduct interviews with privacy/legal officers (n = 17) and information technology specialists (n = 10) from 15 integrated healthcare organizations affiliated with three research nodes of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Trained staff completed a short survey and digitally recorded semi-structured qualitative interview with each participant. Interviews were transcribed and coded within Atlas.ti. Framework analysis was used to identify and organize key themes across selected codes. Participants voiced concern over balancing patient safety with 42 CFR Part 2 privacy protections. Although similar standards of protection regarding release of information outside of the health system was described, numerous workarounds were used to manage intra-institutional communication and care coordination. To align 42 CFR Part 2 restrictions with electronic health records, health systems used sensitive note designation, ""break the glass"" technology, limited role-based access for providers, and ad hoc solutions (e.g., provider messaging). In contemporary integrated care systems, substance-related EHR records (e.g., patient visit history, medication logs) are often accessible internally without specific consent for sharing despite the intent of 42 CFR Part 2. Recent amendments to 42 CFR Part 2 have not addressed information sharing needs within integrated care settings.","Adult;Architecture;Atlas;Best Practices;Clinical Trial;Communication;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data Systems;Delivery of Health Care, Integrated;Drug Abuse;Electronic Health Records;Eyeglasses;Health;Health Care;Health Information Technology;History;Hospitals;Humans;Information Sharing;Information Technology;Interview;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Needs;Organizations;Patient Safety;Patients;Persons;Policy;Primary Health Care;Privacy;Qualitative Research;Records;Regulation;Research;Role;Solutions;Specialists;Standards;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Technology;Therapeutics",Drug Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Admin Supplement: Strategies to reduce stigmaEnhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Optimizing Care for People with OUD and Mental Health Conditions;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33290407,2020,Onset hyperalgesia and offset analgesia: Transient increases or decreases of noxious thermal stimulus intensity robustly modulate subsequent perceived pain intensity.,"Reported pain intensity depends not only on stimulus intensity but also on previously experienced pain. A painfully hot temperature applied to the skin evokes a lower subjective pain intensity if immediately preceded by a higher temperature, a phenomenon called offset analgesia. Previous work indicated that prior pain experience can also increase subsequent perceived pain intensity. Therefore, we examined whether a given noxious stimulus is experienced as more intense when it is preceded by an increase from a lower temperature. Using healthy volunteer subjects, we observed a disproportionate increase in pain intensity at a given stimulus intensity when this intensity is preceded by a rise from a lower intensity. This disproportionate increase is similar in magnitude to that of offset analgesia. We call this effect onset hyperalgesia. Control stimuli, in which a noxious temperature is held constant, demonstrate that onset hyperalgesia is distinct from receptor or central sensitization. The absolute magnitudes of offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia correlate with each other but not with the noxious stimulus temperature. Finally, the magnitude of both offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia depends on preceding temperature changes. Overall, this study demonstrates that the perceptual effect of a noxious thermal stimulus is influenced in a bidirectional manner depending upon both the intensity and direction of change of the immediately preceding thermal stimulus.",Adult;Analgesia;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Hot Temperature;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypesthesia;Male;Nociception;Overall;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Pain Perception;Skin;Temperature;Transients;Work,Hyperalgesia;Hypesthesia;Pain,PLoS One,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Back pain consortium (BACPAC);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
33496787,2021,The Resurrection of Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation: Outcomes Across a Veterans Affairs Collaborative.,"Despite empirical support for interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs improving functioning and quality of life, access to this treatment approach has decreased dramatically over the last 20 years within the United States but has grown significantly in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Between 2009 and 2019, VA pain rehabilitation programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities increased 10-fold in the VA, expanding from two to 20. The aim of this collaborative observational evaluation was to examine patient outcomes across a subset of six programs at five sites. Outcomes were assessed using agreed-upon measures of patient-reported pain intensity, pain interference across various domains, pain catastrophizing, and sleep. A total of 931 patients enrolled in the selected VA interdisciplinary pain programs, with 84.1% of participants completing the full course of treatment. Overall, all programs showed significant improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment in nearly all patient-reported outcomes. The effect sizes ranged from medium to large. Notably, the results demonstrate that positive outcomes were typical despite differences in structure and resources across programs. The adverse impacts of opioid use have highlighted the importance of chronic pain treatment approaches that emphasize team-based care focused on functional improvements. This study represents the first and largest analysis of outcomes across chronic pain rehabilitation programs and demonstrates the need for increased access to similar comprehensive approaches to pain management across the health care system. Further, it suggests that a variety of structures may be effective, encouraging flexibility in adopting this interdisciplinary approach.",Accreditation;Chronic Pain;Health Care Systems;Humans;Measures;Needs;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Management;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Pliability;Program;Quality of Life;Rehabilitation;Rehabilitation Outcome;Resources;Sleep;Therapeutics;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans,Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Back pain consortium (BACPAC);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
35297818,2022,Craving of prescription opioids among veterans with chronic pain.,"The United States faces a crisis because of the high prevalence of chronic pain, concurrent opioid use disorder, and overdose deaths. Prescription opioids remain a primary driver of opioid-related deaths. Craving is a core symptom of addiction, yet the degree to which craving plays a role in prescription opioid use among patients with chronic pain is unknown. Understanding the degree to which craving should be considered in patients with chronic pain is critical for developing effective interventions for supporting patients through opioid tapering. The current work combines data collected from (1) 2152 veterans screened for eligibility at a pain specialty care clinic at the San Francisco VA Health Care System and (2) medical records obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. We found that prescription opioid craving among veterans with chronic pain was low, with 66.4% of the sample reporting no craving and 33.6% reporting craving. We also found that craving had a small association with morphine equivalent daily dose and pain severity but was more strongly associated with depression. Craving of prescription opioids among veterans with chronic pain is complex. Findings are discussed in relation to chronic pain symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, and demographics.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Comprehension;Craving;Data Warehousing;Death;Demography;Depression;Face;Health Care Systems;Humans;Medical Records;Morphine;Morphine Derivatives;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Play;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Role;San Francisco;United States;Veterans;Work",Chronic Pain;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Back pain consortium (BACPAC);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
36062874,2022,Role of C-reactive protein in the bone marrow of Modic type 1 changes.,"Modic type 1 changes (MC1) are vertebral bone marrow lesions and associate with low back pain. Increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) has inconsistently been associated with MC1. We aimed to provide evidence for the role of CRP in the tissue pathophysiology of MC1 bone marrow. From 13 MC1 patients undergoing spinal fusion at MC1 levels, vertebral bone marrow aspirates from MC1 and intrapatient control bone marrow were taken. Bone marrow CRP, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured with a colorimetric assay. CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 were compared between MC1 and control bone marrow. Bone marrow CRP was correlated with blood CRP and with bone marrow IL-1, IL-6, and LDH. CRP expression by marrow cells was measured with a polymerase chain reaction. Increased CRP in MC1 bone marrow (mean difference: +0.22 mg CRP/g, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.04, 0.47], p = 0.088) correlated with blood CRP (r = 0.69, p = 0.018), with bone marrow IL-1β (ρ = 0.52, p = 0.029) and IL-6 (ρ = 0.51, p = 0.031). Marrow cells did not express CRP. Increased LDH in MC1 bone marrow (143.1%, 95% CI [110.7%, 175.4%], p = 0.014) indicated necrosis. A blood CRP threshold of 3.2 mg/L detected with 100% accuracy increased CRP in MC1 bone marrow. In conclusion, the association of CRP with inflammatory and necrotic changes in MC1 bone marrow provides evidence for a pathophysiological role of CRP in MC1 bone marrow.",Association;Biomarkers;Blood;Bone Marrow;C-Reactive Protein;Cells;Confidence Intervals;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1beta;Interleukin-6;Interleukins;Lactate Dehydrogenases;Low Back Pain;Marrow;Necrosis;Patients;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Role;Serum;Spinal Fusion;Tissues,Low Back Pain;Necrosis,J Orthop Res,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Back pain consortium (BACPAC);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
36202255,2022,Learning from addiction: Craving of prescription opioids in chronic pain sufferers.,"Prescription opioids are a primary driver of opioid-related deaths. Although craving is a substantial component of OUD, the degree to which craving leads to misuse among chronic pain patients on long-term prescription opioids is unknown. A clear understanding of the factors that lead to misuse in this vulnerable population is needed for the development of safe and effective practices for opioid taper. This narrative review summarizes the relevant literature on the role of craving in addiction and chronic pain through epidemiological and behavioral studies. The first part of this review examines the role of craving in predicting opioid use/misuse in individuals with chronic pain with and without OUD. The second part covers methods on how craving is evaluated experimentally using both subjective and objective measures and provides related findings. The overall goal of this review is to facilitate the development of a population-specific description of craving in those who use opioids to control chronic pain and to describe how it may be mechanistically linked to patterns of opioid (mis)use.","Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Craving;Cues;Death;Goals;Humans;Lead;Learning;Literature;Measures;Methods;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patients;Population;Prescriptions;Review;Role;Vulnerable Populations",Chronic Pain;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Back pain consortium (BACPAC);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
35319501,2022,Features and methods to discriminate between mechanism-based categories of pain experienced in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi expert consensus study.,"Classification of musculoskeletal pain based on underlying pain mechanisms (nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain) is challenging. In the absence of a gold standard, verification of features that could aid in discrimination between these mechanisms in clinical practice and research depends on expert consensus. This Delphi expert consensus study aimed to: (1) identify features and assessment findings that are unique to a pain mechanism category or shared between no more than 2 categories and (2) develop a ranked list of candidate features that could potentially discriminate between pain mechanisms. A group of international experts were recruited based on their expertise in the field of pain. The Delphi process involved 2 rounds: round 1 assessed expert opinion on features that are unique to a pain mechanism category or shared between 2 (based on a 40% agreement threshold); and round 2 reviewed features that failed to reach consensus, evaluated additional features, and considered wording changes. Forty-nine international experts representing a wide range of disciplines participated. Consensus was reached for 196 of 292 features presented to the panel (clinical examination-134 features, quantitative sensory testing-34, imaging and diagnostic testing-14, and pain-type questionnaires-14). From the 196 features, consensus was reached for 76 features as unique to nociceptive (17), neuropathic (37), or nociplastic (22) pain mechanisms and 120 features as shared between pairs of pain mechanism categories (78 for neuropathic and nociplastic pain). This consensus study generated a list of potential candidate features that are likely to aid in discrimination between types of musculoskeletal pain.",Classification;Consensus;Delphi Technique;Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures;Expert Opinion;Gold;Humans;Methods;Musculoskeletal Pain;Musculoskeletal System;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Questionnaires;Research;Standards;Surveys and Questionnaires,Musculoskeletal Pain;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,"Admin Supplement: Training in Clinical Research on Pain;Increasing Participant Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement in HEAL Research;Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion;PRagmatic and Implementation Studies for the Management of Pain to Reduce Opioid"

32694387,2020,"The revised International Association for the Study of Pain definition of pain: concepts, challenges, and compromises.","The current International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage"" was recommended by the Subcommittee on Taxonomy and adopted by the IASP Council in 1979. This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage,"" and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology.

32915024,2020,Emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic factor underlying co-occurring chronic pain and problematic opioid use.,"Chronic pain is a common and costly condition, and some people with chronic pain engage in problematic opioid use. There is a critical need to identify factors underlying this co-occurrence, so that treatment can be targeted to improve outcomes. We propose that difficulty with emotion regulation (ER) is a transdiagnostic factor that underlies the co-occurrence of chronic pain and problematic opioid use (CP-POU). In this narrative review, we draw from prominent models of ER to summarize the literature characterizing ER in chronic pain and CP-POU. We conclude that chronic pain is associated with various ER difficulties, including emotion identification and the up- and down-regulation of both positive and negative emotion. Little research has examined ER specifically in CP-POU; however, initial evidence suggests CP-POU is characterized by difficulties with ER that are similar to those found in chronic pain more generally. There is great potential to expand the treatment of ER to improve pain-related outcomes in chronic pain and CP-POU. More research is needed, however, to elucidate ER in CP-POU and to determine which types of ER strategies are optimal for different clinical presentations and categories of problematic opioid use.

32943709,2020,Transcriptomic sex differences in sensory neuronal populations of mice.,"Many chronic pain conditions show sex differences in their epidemiology. This could be attributed to sex-dependent differential expression of genes (DEGs) involved in nociceptive pathways, including sensory neurons. This study aimed to identify sex-dependent DEGs in estrous female versus male sensory neurons, which were prepared by using different approaches and ganglion types. RNA-seq on non-purified sensory neuronal preparations, such as whole dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and hindpaw tissues, revealed only a few sex-dependent DEGs. Sensory neuron purification increased numbers of sex-dependent DEGs. These DEG sets were substantially influenced by preparation approaches and ganglion types [DRG vs trigeminal ganglia (TG)]. Percoll-gradient enriched DRG and TG neuronal fractions produced distinct sex-dependent DEG groups. We next isolated a subset of sensory neurons by sorting DRG neurons back-labeled from paw and thigh muscle. These neurons have a unique sex-dependent DEG set, yet there is similarity in biological processes linked to these different groups of sex-dependent DEGs. Female-predominant DEGs in sensory neurons relate to inflammatory, synaptic transmission and extracellular matrix reorganization processes that could exacerbate neuro-inflammation severity, especially in TG. Male-selective DEGs were linked to oxidative phosphorylation and protein/molecule metabolism and production. Our findings catalog preparation-dependent sex differences in neuronal gene expressions in sensory ganglia.","Animals;Back;Biological Processes;Catalog;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Epidemiology;Extracellular Matrix;Female;Ganglia, Sensory;Ganglia, Spinal;Ganglion Cysts;Gene Expression;Genes;Inflammation;Male;Metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Muscles;Neurons;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Population;Production;Proteins;RNA-Seq;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Synaptic Transmission;Thigh;Tissues;Transcriptome;Trigeminal Ganglion",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation,Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34371025,2021,Automated analyses for single-fiber electrophysiological recordings using a newly developed Microsoft Excel application and graphical user interface.,"Electrophysiological recordings of isolated sensory afferents are commonly used in the field of pain research to investigate peripheral mechanisms of nociception in various pain models. The method involves skillful and tedious recordings of teased fibers from nerve preparations as well as time-consuming post-recording analyses. To increase efficiency and productivity of data analyses of recorded action potentials, we developed and validated a novel, easy-to-use Microsoft Excel-based application using Visual Basic Programming. A code for the novel program, shigraspike1.0, was written to create a module to include customizable subroutines for analyses for electrical and mechanical responses. Using previously recorded action potentials with tongue-lingual nerve preparations, the program was validated for appropriate execution, ease-of-use, accuracy of the output data and time taken for analyses. We observed appropriate execution of shigraspike1.0 on Windows and iOS desktop platforms that included computation of response latency of the spike of interest using electrical stimulus as well as estimation of the number of impulses at each force with a step-and-hold mechanical ramp of 10-200mN. Output data obtained by shigrapsike1.0 for both stimulus types were accurate and statistically insignificant from manual analyses. The novel application shigraspike1.0, allows for rapid analyses for single-fiber recordings and takes less than half the time to analyze electrical and mechanical responses compared to manual analyses. The newly developed shigraspike1.0 application can be a very productive tool to be routinely used for efficient analyses of single-fiber electrophysiology in pain research.",Action Potentials;Automation;Data Analysis;Efficiency;Electrophysiology;Lingual Nerve;Methods;Nociception;Pain;Productivity;Program;Ramps;Reaction Time;Research;Response Latency;Time;Tongue,Pain,J Neurosci Methods,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35065194,2022,Sex-dependent pain trajectories induced by prolactin require an inflammatory response for pain resolution.,"Pain development and resolution patterns in many diseases are sex-dependent. This study aimed to develop pain models with sex-dependent resolution trajectories, and identify factors linked to resolution of pain in females and males. Using different intra-plantar (i.pl.) treatment protocols with prolactin (PRL), we established models with distinct, sex-dependent patterns for development and resolution of pain. An acute PRL-evoked pain trajectory, in which hypersensitivity is fully resolved within 1 day, showed substantial transcriptional changes after pain-resolution in female and male hindpaws and in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This finding supports the notion that pain resolution is an active process. Prolonged treatment with PRL high dose (1 μg) evoked mechanical hypersensitivity that resolved within 5-7 days in mice of both sexes and exhibited a pro-inflammatory transcriptional response in the hindpaw, but not DRG, at the time point preceding resolution. Flow cytometry analysis linked pro-inflammatory responses in female hindpaws to macrophages/monocytes, especially CD11b+/CD64+/MHCII+ cell accumulation. Prolonged low dose PRL (0.1 μg) treatment caused non-resolving mechanical hypersensitivity only in females. This effect was independent of sensory neuronal PRLR and was associated with a lack of immune response in the hindpaw, although many genes underlying tissue damage were affected. We conclude that different i.pl. PRL treatment protocols generates distinct, sex-specific pain hypersensitivity resolution patterns. PRL-induced pain resolution is preceded by a pro-inflammatory macrophage/monocyte-associated response in the hindpaws of mice of both sexes. On the other hand, the absence of a peripheral inflammatory response creates a permissive condition for PRL-induced pain persistency in females.","Animals;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease;Female;Flow Cytometry;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Hand;Hypersensitivity;Immunity;Inflammation;Macrophages;Male;Mice;Monocytes;Pain;Prolactin;Receptors, Prolactin;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Skin;Therapeutics;Time;Tissues;Treatment Protocols",Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Pain,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35775366,2022,Derivation and validation of risk prediction for posttraumatic stress symptoms following trauma exposure.,"Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are common following traumatic stress exposure (TSE). Identification of individuals with PTSS risk in the early aftermath of TSE is important to enable targeted administration of preventive interventions. In this study, we used baseline survey data from two prospective cohort studies to identify the most influential predictors of substantial PTSS. Self-identifying black and white American women and men (n = 1546) presenting to one of 16 emergency departments (EDs) within 24 h of motor vehicle collision (MVC) TSE were enrolled. Individuals with substantial PTSS (⩾33, Impact of Events Scale - Revised) 6 months after MVC were identified via follow-up questionnaire. Sociodemographic, pain, general health, event, and psychological/cognitive characteristics were collected in the ED and used in prediction modeling. Ensemble learning methods and Monte Carlo cross-validation were used for feature selection and to determine prediction accuracy. External validation was performed on a hold-out sample (30% of total sample). Twenty-five percent (n = 394) of individuals reported PTSS 6 months following MVC. Regularized linear regression was the top performing learning method. The top 30 factors together showed good reliability in predicting PTSS in the external sample (Area under the curve = 0.79 ± 0.002). Top predictors included acute pain severity, recovery expectations, socioeconomic status, self-reported race, and psychological symptoms. These analyses add to a growing literature indicating that influential predictors of PTSS can be identified and risk for future PTSS estimated from characteristics easily available/assessable at the time of ED presentation following TSE.","Acute Pain;Administration;Baseline Survey;Blacks;Cohort Studies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Expectations;Future;Health;Influentials;Learning;Linear Regression;Literature;Machine Learning;Men;Methods;Motor Vehicles;Pain;Questionnaires;Racial Stocks;Risk;Risk Factors;Scales;Self;Socioeconomic Status;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Time;Whites;Women;Wounds and Injuries","Acute Pain;Pain;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Wounds and Injuries",Psychol Med,Cross-Cutting Projects;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
31310611,2019,Subtypes in patients with opioid misuse: A prognostic enrichment strategy using electronic health record data in hospitalized patients.,"Approaches are needed to better delineate the continuum of opioid misuse that occurs in hospitalized patients. A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes. This was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes. The analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p&lt;0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p&lt;0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p&lt;0.01). A 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse. Distinct subtypes were delineated after examining multiple domains of EHR data and applying methods in artificial intelligence. The approach with LCA and readily available class-defining substance use variables from the EHR may be applied as a prognostic enrichment strategy for targeted interventions.","Adult;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Analgesics, Opioid;Analysis, Cohort;Artificial Intelligence;Association;Censuses;Death;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health Care;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Inpatients;Latent Class Analysis;Machine Learning;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Models, Theoretical;Natural Language Processing;Observational Study;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Discharge;Patients;Precision Medicine;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prognosis;Psychotic Disorders;Socioeconomic Status;Statistics;Substance Use;Tertiary Care Centers;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Death;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Psychotic Disorders;Substance Use,PLoS One,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
31689260,2019,The Substance Use Intervention Team: A Preliminary Analysis of a Population-level Strategy to Address the Opioid Crisis at an Academic Health Center.,"In 2017, an academic health center in Chicago launched the multidisciplinary Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT) to address opioid misuse across 18 inpatient units and in a new outpatient addiction medicine clinic. This report assesses the first 5 months of implementation and associations with patient health and healthcare utilization. Patient demographic and screening data were extracted from the administrative data warehouse of the electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure. Distribution of sample characteristics for positive initial screens for opioid misuse was tested against those of all patients screened using a 2-tailed test of proportions (P &lt; 0.05). A second analysis compared length of stay and 30-day readmissions within a cohort of patients with a secondary diagnosis of substance use disorder. Between November, 2017 and March, 2018, 76% of 15,054 unique patients were screened, 578 had positive scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Drug Abuse Screening Test, 131 had positive scores for opioid misuse, and 52 patients initiated medication treatment. Patients with a secondary diagnosis of substance use disorder who received a SUIT consult (n = 161), compared with those who did not (n = 612), had a shorter average length of stay (5.91 vs 6.73 days) and lower 30-day readmission rate (13.6% vs 15.7%). Leveraging the EHR to conduct standardized screenings and treatment has helped identify an at-risk population-disproportionately younger, black, and male-and treat new cases of opioid and substance misuse. The intervention indicates trends toward a shortened length of stay, reduced 30-day readmissions, and has linked patients to outpatient care.","Addiction Medicine;Address;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alcohol Use Disorder;Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Blacks;Chicago;Child;Child, Preschool;Data Warehousing;Demography;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Health Care;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Inpatients;Length of Stay;Male;Middle Aged;News;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patient Readmission;Patients;Population;Prescription Drug Misuse;Report;Risk;Screening;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Alcohol Use Disorder;Drug Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
32349766,2020,Publicly available machine learning models for identifying opioid misuse from the clinical notes of hospitalized patients.,"Automated de-identification methods for removing protected health information (PHI) from the source notes of the electronic health record (EHR) rely on building systems to recognize mentions of PHI in text, but they remain inadequate at ensuring perfect PHI removal. As an alternative to relying on de-identification systems, we propose the following solutions: (1) Mapping the corpus of documents to standardized medical vocabulary (concept unique identifier [CUI] codes mapped from the Unified Medical Language System) thus eliminating PHI as inputs to a machine learning model; and (2) training character-based machine learning models that obviate the need for a dictionary containing input words/n-grams. We aim to test the performance of models with and without PHI in a use-case for an opioid misuse classifier. An observational cohort sampled from adult hospital inpatient encounters at a health system between 2007 and 2017. A case-control stratified sampling (n = 1000) was performed to build an annotated dataset for a reference standard of cases and non-cases of opioid misuse. Models for training and testing included CUI codes, character-based, and n-gram features. Models applied were machine learning with neural network and logistic regression as well as expert consensus with a rule-based model for opioid misuse. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) were compared between models for discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and visual plots measured model fit and calibration. Machine learning models with CUI codes performed similarly to n-gram models with PHI. The top performing models with AUROCs &gt; 0.90 included CUI codes as inputs to a convolutional neural network, max pooling network, and logistic regression model. The top calibrated models with the best model fit were the CUI-based convolutional neural network and max pooling network. The top weighted CUI codes in logistic regression has the related terms 'Heroin' and 'Victim of abuse'. We demonstrate good test characteristics for an opioid misuse computable phenotype that is void of any PHI and performs similarly to models that use PHI.

33359220,2021,Editorial: Analyzing Treatment and Prescribing in Large Administrative Datasets With a Lens on Equity.,"In this issue of the Journal, Bushnell and colleagues1 present findings from their analysis of a commercial insurance administrative dataset, examining the ways that antipsychotics are used in young children (aged 2-7 years) in the United States. From 2009 to 2017, they find that the use of antipsychotics decreased and there was a shift toward use of medications in alignment with evidence-based standards. The most common conditions for use of antipsychotics included pervasive developmental disorders, externalizing disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. More troubling were the findings that less than half of young children on antipsychotics had a visit with a psychiatrist, and only a third of children had evidence of a minimum dose of psychotherapy. These findings deserve attention and should be a cause for strengthening the use of existing treatment guidelines for preschool and younger children. They should also prompt enhanced advocacy to expand access to evidence-based mental health care for children that includes high-quality psychiatric assessment, treatment, and psychotherapy. The latter includes increasing the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists who focus on preschool-aged and younger children.","Adolescent;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents;Attention;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Child;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Child, Preschool;Dataset;Editorial;Guideline;Humans;Insurance;Mental Health;Psychiatrists;Psychiatry;Psychotherapy;Standards;Therapeutics;United States","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34383925,2021,Bias and fairness assessment of a natural language processing opioid misuse classifier: detection and mitigation of electronic health record data disadvantages across racial subgroups.,"To assess fairness and bias of a previously validated machine learning opioid misuse classifier. Two experiments were conducted with the classifier's original (n = 1000) and external validation (n = 53 974) datasets from 2 health systems. Bias was assessed via testing for differences in type II error rates across racial/ethnic subgroups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Other) using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A local surrogate model was estimated to interpret the classifier's predictions by race and averaged globally from the datasets. Subgroup analyses and post-hoc recalibrations were conducted to attempt to mitigate biased metrics. We identified bias in the false negative rate (FNR = 0.32) of the Black subgroup compared to the FNR (0.17) of the White subgroup. Top features included ""heroin"" and ""substance abuse"" across subgroups. Post-hoc recalibrations eliminated bias in FNR with minimal changes in other subgroup error metrics. The Black FNR subgroup had higher risk scores for readmission and mortality than the White FNR subgroup, and a higher mortality risk score than the Black true positive subgroup (P &lt; .05). The Black FNR subgroup had the greatest severity of disease and risk for poor outcomes. Similar features were present between subgroups for predicting opioid misuse, but inequities were present. Post-hoc mitigation techniques mitigated bias in type II error rate without creating substantial type I error rates. From model design through deployment, bias and data disadvantages should be systematically addressed.

The result was corroborated in an independent EA OUD sample (n = 398, p = 0.0036; for the combined samples). Notably, this SNP is an expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for VIPR2 and a long intergenic non-coding RNA, lincRNA 689, in a tissue-specific manner, based on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an important peptide of light-activated suprachiasmatic nucleus cells. It regulates diverse physiological processes including circadian rhythms, learning and memory, and stress response. This is the first report of an association of a VIPR2 variant and OUD. Additionally, analysis of combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotypes revealed an association of PER2 SNP rs80136044, and SNP rs4128839, located 41.6 kb downstream of neuropeptide Y receptor type 1 gene, NPY1R (p = 3.4 × 10-6, OR = 11.4, 95% CI 2.7-48.2). The study provides preliminary insight into the relationship between genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes and long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) in their vicinity, and opioid addiction.","3' Untranslated Regions;Association;Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors;Casein Kinase Iepsilon;Circadian Rhythm;Drug Dependence;Genes;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetics;Genotype;Humans;Learning;Light;Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA;Memory;Opioid-Related Disorders;Peptides;Period Circadian Proteins;Physiological Processes;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Quantitative Trait Loci;RNA, Long Noncoding;RNA, Untranslated;Receptors, Neuropeptide Y;Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Type II;Report;Repressor Proteins;Reward;Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Cells;Tissues;Untranslated Regions;Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide",Drug Dependence;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Opioid-Related Disorders,PLoS One,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Enhancing the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network to Address O;Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
36174365,2022,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in children with ADHD: A randomized, sham-controlled pilot study.","ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a pediatric prevalence of 5.2%.While medication treatment for ADHD is effective, it does not address all symptoms and a small but notable subgroup does not respond to medications. Adverse effects limit its use and some parents and participants resist use of medication. Thus, limitations of medication treatment for ADHD motivate searching for other therapeutic options. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a treatment for children with ADHD, with mixed results to date. Protocol variables employed, including combined use of cognitive training (CT) and scheduling of sessions, may explain diverse findings to date. The aim of this study was to examine safety, feasibility and efficacy of tDCS combined with CT provided three-times-per week for one-month to treat children with ADHD. In a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study, 25 children with ADHD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of either anodal tDCS or sham-tDCS for 20 min combined with CT three-times-per-week for four weeks. The tDCS anode was over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over vertex. Assessments were obtained prior to, after 6 sessions, 12 sessions and one-month after intervention. No significant post-intervention differences were found between those receiving tDCS or sham-tDCS. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement on questionnaire measures of ADHD and executive function with mixed results seen on computerized performance measures. Overall, adverse effects were mild with no significant difference between groups. However, three children, all from the tDCS group, experienced headaches with two requiring temporary cessation and one requiring removal from the study.

36354433,2022,Leveraging Accelerometry as a Prognostic Indicator for Increase in Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms.,"Treating opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant healthcare challenge in the United States. Remaining abstinent from opioids is challenging for individuals with OUD due to withdrawal symptoms that include restlessness. However, to our knowledge, studies of acute withdrawal have not quantified restlessness using involuntary movements. We hypothesized that wearable accelerometry placed mid-sternum could be used to detect withdrawal-related restlessness in patients with OUD. To study this, 23 patients with OUD undergoing active withdrawal participated in a protocol involving wearable accelerometry, opioid cues to elicit craving, and non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) to dampen withdrawal symptoms. Using accelerometry signals, we analyzed how movements correlated with changes in acute withdrawal severity, measured by the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS). Our results revealed that patients demonstrating sinusoidal-i.e., predominantly single-frequency oscillation patterns in their motion almost exclusively demonstrated an increase in the COWS, and a strong relationship between the maximum power spectral density and increased withdrawal over time, measured by the COWS (R = 0.92, p = 0.029). Accelerometry may be used in an ambulatory setting to indicate the increased intensity of a patient's withdrawal symptoms, providing an objective, readily-measurable marker that may be captured ubiquitously.","Accelerometry;Analgesics, Opioid;Craving;Cues;Health Care;Humans;Indicators;Involuntary Movements;Knowledge;Motion;Movement;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Power, Psychological;Prognosis;Psychomotor Agitation;Scales;Sternum;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Vagus Nerve Stimulation;Withdrawal Symptoms",Involuntary Movements;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Psychomotor Agitation;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,Biosensors (Basel),Cross-Cutting;ProjectsNovel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse

In addition to the direct effects of COVID-19 infection, physical distancing and quarantine interventions have indirect effects on health. While necessary, physical distancing interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 could have multiple impacts on people living with opioid use disorder, including impacts on mental health that lead to greater substance use, the availability of drug supply, the ways that people use drugs, treatment-seeking behaviors, and retention in care. The degree to which COVID-19 will impact the opioid epidemic and through which of the possible mechanisms that we discuss is important to monitor.

35048187,2022,Neuronal allodynic mechanisms of Slc7a5 (LAT1) in the spared nerve injury rodent model of neuropathic pain.,"High-impact chronic pain is suffered by 1 in 5 patients in the USA and globally. Effective, non-addictive, non-opioid therapeutics are urgently needed for the treatment of chronic pain. Slc7a5 (Lat1), also known as system L-neutral amino acid transporter, is involved in a number of physiological processes related to inflammation. Transcriptomics studies have shown that Slc7a5 and its binding partner Slc3a2 are expressed in neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal dorsal horn, which are critical to the initiation and maintenance of nociception and pathophysiology of chronic pain. In addition, Slc7a5 is a transporter for the first-line anti-allodynic gabapentinoid drugs and binds to ion channels implicated in nociception and chronic pain including the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 and the voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. We found that blocking Slc7a5 with intrathecal administration of the drug JPH203 alleviated allodynia in the spared nerve injury (SNI) rodent model of neuropathic pain. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies revealed an increase in Slc7a5 protein levels in the spinal cord and DRGs of SNI mice compared to control mice. Using whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology, we observed that JPH203 treatment reduced excitability of small-diameter (&lt; 30 µm) DRG neurons from SNI mice, in agreement with its behavioral effects. Voltage-clamp recordings from JPH203-treated naïve rat DRGs identified an effect on tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium currents. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Slc7a5 is dysregulated in chronic neuropathic pain and can be targeted to provide relief of hypersensitivity.","Administration;Allodynia;Amino Acid Transport Systems, Neutral;Animals;Blot, Western;Cells;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Electrophysiology;Ganglia, Spinal;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Immunohistochemistry;Inflammation;Injuries;Ion Channels;Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1;Maintenance;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological Processes;Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Rodentia;Sodium;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Tetrodotoxin;Therapeutics;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels",Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injuries;Neuralgia,Pflugers Arch,Cross-Cutting Projects;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Optimizing Non-Addictive Therapies to Treat Pain
36007855,2022,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist ELB00824 suppresses oxaliplatin-induced pain, neuronal hypersensitivity, and oxidative stress.","Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP) is a debilitating and difficult-to-treat side effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. CINP is marked with oxidative stress and neuronal hypersensitivities. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. We hypothesize that PPARγ agonists are protective against CIPN by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting neuronal hypersensitivities. To test our hypothesis, acute or chronic CIPN was introduced by short or long-term treatment of oxaliplatin in BALB/c mice. CIPN mice were treated with either a novel blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrable PPARγ agonist ELB00824, or a BBB non-penetrable PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, or vehicle. Cold allodynia, mechanical allodynia, motor coordination, sedation and addiction were measured with dry ice, von Frey filaments, beam-walking tests, and conditioned place preference, respectively. Oxidative stress was accessed by measuring byproducts of protein oxidation (carbonyl and 3-Nitrotyrosine) and lipid peroxidation [Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)], as wells as gene expression of Cat, Sod2, Ppargc1a. The effects of ELB00824 on nociceptor excitability were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology of isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons. Preemptive ELB00824, but not pioglitazone, reduced oxaliplatin-induced cold and mechanical allodynia and oxidative stress. ELB0824 suppressed oxaliplatin-induced firing in IB4- neurons. ELB00824 did not cause motor discoordination or sedation/addiction or reduce the antineoplastic activity of oxaliplatin (measured with an MTS-based cell proliferation assay) in a human colon cancer cell line (HCT116) and a human oral cancer cell line (HSC-3). Our results demonstrated that ELB00824 prevents oxaliplatin-induced pain, likely via inhibiting neuronal hypersensitivities and oxidative stress.","Allodynia;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Blood-Brain Barrier;Cancer of Colon;Cancer of Mouth;Cats;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Cold Temperature;Drug Therapy;Dry Ice;Electrophysiology;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Genes;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Lipid Peroxidation;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociceptors;Oxaliplatin;Oxidative Stress;PPAR gamma;Pain;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pioglitazone;Proteins;Therapeutics;Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances;Transcription Factors;Walking",Allodynia;Cancer of Colon;Cancer of Mouth;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain,Neuropharmacology,Cross-Cutting Projects;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Optimizing Non-Addictive Therapies to Treat Pain
33355345,2021,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guideline on Neuroablative Procedures for Patients With Cancer Pain.,"Managing cancer pain once it is refractory to conventional treatment continues to challenge caregivers committed to serving those who are suffering from a malignancy. Although neuromodulation has a role in the treatment of cancer pain for some patients, these therapies may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, neuroablative procedures, which were once a mainstay in treating intractable cancer pain, are again on the rise. This guideline serves as a systematic review of the literature of the outcomes following neuroablative procedures. To establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain. A systematic review of neuroablative procedures used to treat patients with cancer pain from 1980 to April 2019 was performed using the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. After inclusion criteria were established, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by 2 members of the task force and the quality of the evidence was graded. In total, 14 646 relevant abstracts were identified by the literature search, from which 189 met initial screening criteria. After full text review, 58 of the 189 articles were included and subdivided into 4 different clinical scenarios. These include unilateral somatic nociceptive/neuropathic body cancer pain, craniofacial cancer pain, midline subdiaphragmatic visceral cancer pain, and disseminated cancer pain. Class II and III evidence was available for these 4 clinical scenarios. Level III recommendations were developed for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain. Neuroablative procedures may be an option for treating patients with refractory cancer pain. Serious adverse events were reported in some studies, but were relatively uncommon. Improved imaging, refinements in technique and the availability of new lesioning modalities may minimize the risks of neuroablation even further.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/guidelines-on-neuroablative-procedures-patients-wi.","Abstracts;Advisory Committees;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Caregivers;Central Nervous System;Clinical Practice Guideline;Congress;Congresses as Topic;Cordotomy;Database;Evidence-Based Medicine;Guideline;Humans;Literature;National Library of Medicine (U.S.);Neurosurgeons;News;Pain, Intractable;Patients;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Procedures;PubMed;Radiofrequency Ablation;Review;Risk;Role;Screening;Systematic Review;Therapeutics","Cancer;Cancer Pain;Pain, Intractable",Neurosurgery,Cross-Cutting Projects;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment

To compare our general and neuromodulation cohorts based on referrals, diagnosis, and therapy and describe our neuromodulation patients. A multidisciplinary team was established at our center. The intake coordinator assessed demographics and facilitated care of enrolled patients. Outcomes were compared using minimal clinical important difference of current Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) between patients with neuropathic pain who received neuromodulation and those who did not. The neuromodulation cohort completed outcome metrics at baseline and recent follow-up, including NRS score (best, worst, and current), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Beck Depression Inventory, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Over 7 yr, 233 patients were referred to our consortium and 153 were enrolled. A total of 55 patients had neuropathic pain and 44 of those were managed medically. Eleven underwent neuromodulation. A total of 45.5% patients of the neuromodulation cohort were classified as responders by minimal clinically important difference compared to 26.6% responders in the control cohort at most recent follow-up (median 25 and 33 mo, respectively). Outcome measures revealed improvement in NRS at worst (P = .007) and best (P = .025), ODI (P = .014), and Pain Catastrophizing Scale Rumination (P = .043). Eleven percent of patients were offered neuromodulation. There were more responders in the neuromodulation cohort than the conservatively managed neuropathic pain cohort. Neuromodulation patients showed significant improvement at 29 mo in NRS best and worst pain, disability, and rumination.

33862596,2021,Development of a common peroneal nerve injury model in domestic swine for the study of translational neuropathic pain treatments.,"To date, muscular and bone pain have been studied in domestic swine models, but the only neuropathic pain model described in swine is a mixed neuritis model. Common peroneal nerve injury (CPNI) neuropathic pain models have been utilized in both mice and rats. The authors developed a swine surgical CPNI model of neuropathic pain. Behavioral outcomes were validated with von Frey filament testing, thermal sensitivity assessments, and social and motor scoring. Demyelination of the nerve was confirmed through standard histological assessment. The contralateral nerve served as the control. CPNI induced mechanical and thermal allodynia (p &lt; 0.001 [n = 10] and p &lt; 0.05 [n = 4], respectively) and increased pain behavior, i.e., guarding of the painful leg (n = 12). Myelin protein zero (P0) staining revealed demyelination of the ligated nerve upstream of the ligation site. In a neuropathic pain model in domestic swine, the authors demonstrated that CPNI induces demyelination of the common peroneal nerve, which the authors hypothesize is responsible for the resulting allodynic pain behavior. As the anatomical features of domestic swine resemble those of humans more closely than previously used rat and mouse models, utilizing this swine model, which is to the authors' knowledge the first of its kind, will aid in the translation of experimental treatments to clinical trials.","Behavior;Bones;Clinical Trial;Dates;Demyelination;Humans;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injuries;Knowledge;Leg;Ligation;Mice;Myelin P0 Protein;Neuralgia;Neuritis;Pain;Peripheral Nerves;Peroneal Nerve;Rats;Sensitivity;Staining;Standards;Swine;Therapeutics;Translations","Demyelination;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Injuries;Neuralgia;Neuritis;Pain",J Neurosurg,Cross-Cutting Projects;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce Diversity;Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment

We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result. A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit.

34159545,2021,Integrating Harm Reduction into Outpatient Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Settings : Harm Reduction in Outpatient Addiction Treatment.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasingly recognized as a chronic, relapsing brain disease whose treatment should be integrated into primary care settings alongside other chronic conditions. However, abstinence from all non-prescribed substance use continues to be prioritized as the only desired goal in many outpatient, primary care-based treatment programs. This presents a barrier to engagement for patients who continue to use substances and who may be at high risk for complications of ongoing substance use such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), superficial and deep tissue infections, and overdose. Harm reduction aims to reduce the negative consequences of substance use and offers an alternative to abstinence as a singular goal. Incorporating harm reduction principles into primary care treatment settings can support programs in engaging patients with ongoing substance use and facilitate the delivery of evidence-based screening and prevention services. The objective of this narrative review is to describe strategies for the integration of evidence-based harm reduction principles and interventions into outpatient, primary care-based OUD treatment settings. We will offer specific tools for providers and programs including strategies to support safer injection practices, assess the risks and benefits of continuing medications for opioid use disorder in the setting of ongoing substance use, promote a non-stigmatizing program culture, and address the needs of special populations with ongoing substance use including adolescents, parents, and families.","Address;Adolescent;Behavior, Addictive;Brain Diseases;Culture;Drug Overdose;Family;Goals;HIV;Harm Reduction;Hepatitis C virus;Humans;Infections;Injections;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Outpatients;Parents;Patients;Population;Primary Health Care;Program;Review;Risk;Risks and Benefits;Screening;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Tissues",Brain Diseases;Drug Overdose;Hepatitis C;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce DiversityHEALing Communities
34297070,2021,Methadone Access for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Within the United States and Canada.,"Methadone access may be uniquely vulnerable to disruption during COVID-19, and even short delays in access are associated with decreased medication initiation and increased illicit opioid use and overdose death. Relative to Canada, US methadone provision is more restricted and limited to specialized opioid treatment programs. To compare timely access to methadone initiation in the US and Canada during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2020. Participating clinics provided methadone for opioid use disorder in 14 US states and territories and 3 Canadian provinces with the highest opioid overdose death rates. Statistical analysis was performed from July 2020 to January 2021. Nation and type of health insurance (US Medicaid and US self-pay vs Canadian provincial). Proportion of clinics accepting new patients and days to first appointment. Among 268 of 298 US clinics contacted as a patient with Medicaid (90%), 271 of 301 US clinics contacted as a self-pay patient (90%), and 237 of 288 Canadian clinics contacted as a patient with provincial insurance (82%), new patients were accepted for methadone at 231 clinics (86%) during US Medicaid contacts, 230 clinics (85%) during US self-pay contacts, and at 210 clinics (89%) during Canadian contacts. Among clinics not accepting new patients, at least 44% of 27 clinics reported that the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason. The mean wait for first appointment was greater among US Medicaid contacts (3.5 days [95% CI, 2.9-4.2 days]) and US self-pay contacts (4.1 days [95% CI, 3.4-4.8 days]) than Canadian contacts (1.9 days [95% CI, 1.7-2.1 days]) (P &lt; .001). Open-access model (walk-in hours for new patients without an appointment) utilization was reported by 57 Medicaid (30%), 57 self-pay (30%), and 115 Canadian (59%) contacts offering an appointment. In this cross-sectional study of 2 nations, more than 1 in 10 methadone clinics were not accepting new patients. Canadian clinics offered more timely methadone access than US opioid treatment programs. These results suggest that the methadone access shortage was exacerbated by COVID-19 and that changes to the US opioid treatment program model are needed to improve the timeliness of access. Increased open-access model adoption may increase timely access.","Adoption;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Analgesics, Opioid;Appointments;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Canada;Cross-Sectional Studies;Death;Death Rate;Financing, Personal;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Insurance;Insurance, Health;Medicaid;Methadone;News;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Patients;Program;Relatives;Self;Therapeutics;United States;Waiting Lists",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce DiversityHEALing Communities
35224768,2022,Broadband internet subscription rates and opioid prescribing via telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US DEA allowed controlled substance prescriptions to be issued following a telemedicine encounter. This study evaluated changes in opioid prescribing in Kentucky counties with low and high rates of broadband subscription before, during, and after a series of statewide emergency declarations that may have affected health care access. The study used the prescription drug monitoring program to analyze records of opioid analgesic prescriptions dispensed to opioid-naïve individuals in high (N = 26) and low (N = 94) broadband access counties during 3 periods: before a state of emergency (SOE) and executive order (EO) limiting nonemergent health care services (January 2019-February 2020), while the EO was active (March-April 2020), and after health care services began reopening (May-December 2020). Marginal generalized estimating equations-type negative binomial models were fit to compare prescription counts by broadband access over the 3 periods. Rates of opioid dispensing to opioid-naïve individuals decreased significantly during the EO, but increased nearly to pre-SOE levels after health care services began reopening. Dispensing rates in low broadband counties were higher than those in high broadband counties during all time periods, although these differences were negligible after adjusting for potential confounders. During the EO, prescriptions were written for longer days' supply in both county types. The overall dramatic reduction in opioid prescribing rates should be considered when evaluating annual opioid prescribing trends. However, broadband subscription rate did not appear to influence opioid prescriptions dispensed in Kentucky during the EO.","Analgesics, Opioid;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Controlled Substances;Emergencies;Health Care;Humans;Internet;Kentucky;Models, Binomial;Opioids;Overall;Pandemics;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Records;Supplies;Telemedicine;Time",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic,J Rural Health,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Admin Supplement: Workforce DiversityHEALing Communities
36398540,2022,Impacts of the New York State COVID-19 disaster emergency orders on prescription dispensing for opioids and medication for opioid use disorder.,"The aim of this study is to examine whether the March 2020 New York State (NYS) SARS-CoV-2 emergency orders were associated with an initial surge in opioid dispensing and a longer-term reduction in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Time-series analyses of the dispensing of non-MOUD opioid and MOUD prescriptions using IQVIA's longitudinal prescription claims database (n = 16 087 429) in NYS by week, from 1 January 2018 to 31 July 2020. IQVIA is a multi-national company that provides biopharmaceutical development and commercial outsourcing services. NYS Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) codes (n = 1218) in which prescriptions were dispensed. For each ZIP code, for each week, the following dispensing measures were calculated: total weekly morphine milligram equivalents/day (MME/day), total weekly MME/day dispensed via prescriptions for ≤ 7 days and the count of MOUD prescriptions dispensed. Differences in dispensing metrics, comparing each week in 2020 with corresponding weeks in 2019, were calculated for each ZIP code. During the study period, weekly MME/day per ZIP code of dispensed non-MOUD opioids steadily declined. Compared with the difference in dispensing between 2019 and 2020 during the first week in 2020, there was a significantly larger drop in dispensed weekly total MME/day beginning 21 March 2020, and lasting until the week of 17 April (P &lt; 0.05 for each week).

There was not a discernable drop in MOUD dispensing associated with the period of the emergency orders. New York State emergency orders in March 2020 to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preserve hospital capacity appeared to be associated with a decline in dispensing of opioids not used as MOUD.

26076079,2019,Improving Adherence to Practice Guidelines for Anticoagulation in Patients Receiving Neuraxial Anesthesia Using an Electronic Order Entry Alert System.,"Epidural analgesia is frequently used to alleviate postoperative pain. Though rare, epidural hematoma continues to be a feared complication of neuraxial analgesia. The risk of epidural hematoma is likely increased when certain regimens are used for prophylaxis/treatment of venous thromboembolism. To help decrease the risk, we developed an alert in our electronic medical record to assist providers with adherence to published guidelines addressing neuraxial analgesia and anticoagulation. Patient data were collected retrospectively 3 months before and 3 months after the initiation of the computerized alert to assess the effectiveness of the alert. Patients were included if they had a procedure code associated with epidural analgesia. Pregnant patients and children were excluded. Type and frequency of antithrombotic medications were recorded for comparison to published practice guidelines. Using Poisson regression to describe the data, patients with epidurals after the best practice alert observed a 61% decrease in the expected number of days of exposure to inappropriate doses of anticoagulation versus patients treated before implementation of the alert. Unapproved antithrombotic administration was significantly reduced after initiation of the alert system. This simple electronic alert was found to have a protective effect for patients receiving both anticoagulation and epidural analgesia.","Administration;Analgesia;Analgesia, Epidural;Anesthesia;Anticoagulants;Best Practices;Child;Cohort Studies;Electronic Health Records;Electronic Prescribing;Electronics;Female;Guideline;Hematoma;Humans;Male;Medical Order Entry Systems;Medication Adherence;Middle Aged;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Practice Guideline;Procedures;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Therapeutics;Venous Thromboembolism","Hematoma;Pain, Postoperative;Venous Thromboembolism",J Patient Saf,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
28612178,2018,Treatment for Depression and Health-Related Quality of Life among Adults with Arthritis.,"Depression treatment has been proven to relieve depressive symptoms and pain and may therefore improve the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among adults with arthritis. The objective of the current study was to examine the HRQoL associated with depression treatment among adults with arthritis and depression. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study design using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2009-2012) was adopted. The study sample consisted of adults (≥ 21 years) with co-existing arthritis and depression (N = 1692). Depression treatment was categorized into: antidepressants only, psychotherapy with or without antidepressants, and neither antidepressants nor psychotherapy. Multivariable Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regressions, which controlled for observed selection bias with inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW) were built to examine the association between depression treatment categories and the HRQoL scores. The OLS regression controlled for factors in the biological, psychological and social domains that may affect HRQoL. A majority of individuals reported taking antidepressants only (52%), 24.4% reported receiving psychotherapy with or without antidepressants and 23% did not receive either antidepressants or psychotherapy. In multivariable OLS regression with IPTWs, adults using only antidepressants had marginally higher physical component summary scores (beta = 0.96, p value = 0.096) compared to no depression treatment. There were no significant associations between depression categories and mental component summary scores. HRQoL was not affected by depression treatment in adults with coexisting arthritis and depression. Improvement in HRQoL may require a collaborative care approach and such intense care may not be replicated in real-world practice settings.",Adult;Affect;Aged;Antidepressive Agents;Arthritis;Association;Biopharmaceuticals;Cohort Studies;Combined Modality Therapy;Comorbidity;Depression;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Symptoms;Expenditures;Female;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Pain;Probability;Psychotherapy;Quality of Life;Retrospective Studies;Selection Bias;Surveys;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States;Weights;Young Adult,Arthritis;Depressive Disorder;Pain,Psychiatr Q,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29161614,2018,Changes of lumbar posture and tissue loading during static trunk bending.,"Static trunk bending is an occupational risk factor for lower back pain (LBP). When assessing relative short duration trunk bending tasks, existing studies mostly assumed unchanged spine biomechanical responses during task performance. The purpose of the current study was to assess the biomechanical changes of lumbar spine during the performance of relatively short duration, sustained trunk bending tasks. Fifteen participants performed 40-s static trunk bending tasks in two different trunk angles (30° or 60°) with two different hand load levels (0 or 6.8 kg). Results of the current study revealed significantly increased lumbar flexion and lumbar passive moment during the 40 s of trunk bending. Significantly reduced lumbar and abdominal muscle activities were also observed in most conditions. These findings suggest that, during the performance of short duration, static trunk bending tasks, a shift of loading from lumbar active tissues to passive tissues occurs naturally. This mechanism is beneficial in reducing the accumulation of lumbar muscle fatigue; however, lumbar passive tissue creep could be introduced due to prolonged or repetitive exposure.","Abdominal Muscles;Adult;Biomechanical Phenomena;Body Size;Body Weight;Electromyography;Fatigue;Female;Hand;Humans;Low Back Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Lumbosacral Region;Male;Muscle Contraction;Muscle Fatigue;Muscle, Skeletal;Posture;Range of Motion, Articular;Relatives;Risk Factors;Spine;Task Performance;Tissues;Torso;Young Adult",Fatigue;Low Back Pain,Hum Mov Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29192128,2018,Zinc Inhibits TRPV1 to Alleviate Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain.,"Zinc is a transition metal that has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory agent. It also soothes pain sensations in a number of animal models. However, the effects and mechanisms of zinc on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. Here we show that locally injected zinc markedly reduces neuropathic pain in male and female mice induced by paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in a TRPV1-dependent manner. Extracellularly applied zinc also inhibits the function of TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells and mouse DRG neurons, which requires the presence of zinc-permeable TRPA1 to mediate entry of zinc into the cytoplasm. Moreover, TRPA1 is required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-mediated acute nociception. Unexpectedly, zinc transporters, but not TRPA1, are required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-dependent chronic neuropathic pain produced by paclitaxel. Together, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of zinc on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain that relies on the function of TRPV1.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major limiting factor affecting the chemotherapy patients. There is no effective treatment available currently. We demonstrate that zinc prevents paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity via inhibiting the TRPV1 channel, which is involved in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors in chemotherapy. Zinc transporters in DRG neurons are required for the entry of zinc into the intracellular side, where it inhibits TRPV1. Our study provides insight into the mechanism underlying the pain-soothing effect of zinc and suggests that zinc could be developed to therapeutics for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.","Analgesics;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Cytoplasm;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drug Therapy;Female;HEK293 Cells;History;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Male;Metals;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Models, Animal;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Sensation;TRPV Cation Channels;Therapeutics;Zinc;Zinc Acetate",Hypersensitivity;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

29305105,2018,Assessing the feasibility of implementing low-cost virtual reality therapy during routine burn care.,"Burn care often involves procedures that result in significant pain experiences for patients which, in turn, can lead to poorer physical and psychological health outcomes. Distraction and virtual reality (VR) are an effective adjunct to pharmacological interventions in reducing pain. Much of the research that has demonstrated efficacy for VR in burn care has involved expensive and extensive technology. Thus, identifying cost-effective, feasible, acceptable, and effective approaches to apply distraction within routine burn care is important. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate key stakeholder (i.e., patients, providers) perceptions of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness for the use of low-cost VR technology during routine burn care with adult patients. Ten adult patients used VR during burn care dressing changes in an outpatient clinic setting, after which they completed a satisfaction survey and individual qualitative interview. Providers also completed a satisfaction/perception survey after each participant's care. Quantitative and qualitative results from both patient and provider perspectives consistently supported the feasibility and utility of applying low-cost VR technology in this outpatient burn clinic setting. Special considerations (e.g., aspects to consider when choosing an apparatus or application) stemming from stakeholder feedback are discussed.","Adult;Aged;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Bandages;Burns;Cost;Debridement;Dressings;Feasibility Studies;Feedback;Female;Health;Humans;Interview;Lead;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Outpatients;Pain;Pain Management;Pain Measurement;Pain, Procedural;Patients;Perception;Procedures;Research;Satisfaction;Surveys;Technology;Virtual Reality;Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","Burns;Pain;Pain, Procedural",Burns,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29307578,2018,Cell-Cycle-Specific Function of p53 in Fanconi Anemia Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Proliferation.,"Overactive p53 has been proposed as an important pathophysiological factor for bone marrow failure syndromes, including Fanconi anemia (FA). Here, we report a p53-dependent effect on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation in mice deficient for the FA gene Fanca. Deletion of p53 in Fanca-/- mice leads to replicative exhaustion of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in transplant recipients. Using Fanca-/- HSCs expressing the separation-of-function mutant p53515C transgene, which selectively impairs the p53 function in apoptosis but keeps its cell-cycle checkpoint activities intact, we show that the p53 cell-cycle function is specifically required for the regulation of Fanca-/- HSC proliferation. Our results demonstrate that p53 plays a compensatory role in preventing FA HSCs from replicative exhaustion and suggest a cautious approach to manipulating p53 signaling as a therapeutic utility in FA.","Anemia, Aplastic;Animals;Apoptosis;Bone Marrow Diseases;Bone Marrow Failure;Bone Marrow Failure Disorders;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Checkpoints;Cell Proliferation;Fanconi Anemia;Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein;Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental;Genes;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic Stem Cells;Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal;Humans;Lead;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission;Play;Regulation;Report;Role;Separation;Signal Transduction;Stem Cells;Therapeutics;Transgenes;Transplant Recipients;Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Anemia, Aplastic;Bone Marrow Diseases;Bone Marrow Failure;Bone Marrow Failure Disorders;Fanconi Anemia;Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal;Neoplasms",Stem Cell Reports,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29324076,2018,"Brain Functional Changes before, during, and after Clinical Pain.","This study used an emerging brain imaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to investigate functional brain activation and connectivity that modulates sometimes traumatic pain experience in a clinical setting. Hemodynamic responses were recorded at bilateral somatosensory (S1) and prefrontal cortices (PFCs) from 12 patients with dentin hypersensitivity in a dental chair before, during, and after clinical pain. Clinical dental pain was triggered with 20 consecutive descending cold stimulations (32° to 0°C) to the affected teeth. We used a partial least squares path modeling framework to link patients' clinical pain experience with recorded hemodynamic responses at sequential stages and baseline resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Hemodynamic responses at PFC/S1 were sequentially elicited by expectation, cold detection, and pain perception at a high-level coefficient (coefficients: 0.92, 0.98, and 0.99, P &lt; 0.05). We found that the pain ratings were positively affected only at a moderate level of coefficients by such sequence of functional activation (coefficient: 0.52, P &lt; 0.05) and the baseline PFC-S1 RSFC (coefficient: 0.59, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, when the dental pain had finally subsided, the PFC increased its functional connection with the affected S1 orofacial region contralateral to the pain stimulus and, in contrast, decreased with the ipsilateral homuncular S1 regions ( P &lt; 0.05). Our study indicated for the first time that patients' clinical pain experience in the dental chair can be predicted concomitantly by their baseline functional connectivity between S1 and PFC, as well as their sequence of ongoing hemodynamic responses. In addition, this linked cascade of events had immediate after-effects on the patients' brain connectivity, even when clinical pain had already ceased. Our findings offer a better understating of the ongoing impact of affective and sensory experience in the brain before, during, and after clinical dental pain.","Adult;Brain;Brain Imaging;Cold Temperature;Dentin Sensitivity;Expectations;Female;Functional Neuroimaging;Hemodynamics;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Male;Neurovascular Coupling;Pain;Pain Perception;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Somatosensory Cortex;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Time;Tooth;Young Adult",Dentin Sensitivity;Pain,J Dent Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29333880,2018,Pharmacogenetic analysis of opioid dependence treatment dose and dropout rate.,"Currently, no pharmacogenetic tests for selecting an opioid-dependence pharmacotherapy have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Determine the effects of variants in 11 genes on dropout rate and dose in patients receiving methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00315341). Variants in six pharmacokinetic genes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and five pharmacodynamic genes (HTR2A, OPRM1, ADRA2A, COMT, SLC6A4) were genotyped in samples from a 24-week, randomized, open-label trial of methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of opioid dependence (n = 764; 68.7% male). Genotypes were then used to determine the metabolism phenotype for each pharmacokinetic gene. Phenotypes or genotypes for each gene were analyzed for association with dropout rate and mean dose. Genotype for 5-HTTLPR in the SLC6A4 gene was nominally associated with dropout rate when the methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone groups were combined. When the most significant variants associated with dropout rate were analyzed using pairwise analyses, SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) and COMT (Val158Met; rs4860) had nominally significant associations with dropout rate in methadone patients. None of the genes analyzed in the study was associated with mean dose of methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. This study suggests that functional polymorphisms related to synaptic dopamine or serotonin levels may predict dropout rates during methadone treatment. Patients with the S/S genotype at 5-HTTLPR in SLC6A4 or the Val/Val genotype at Val158Met in COMT may require additional treatment to improve their chances of completing addiction treatment. Replication in other methadone patient populations will be necessary to ensure the validity of these findings.","Adult;Association;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4;Dopamine;Drug Therapy;Female;Genes;Genotype;Humans;Male;Metabolism;Methadone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Dropouts;Patients;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Analysis;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Pharmacokinetics;Phenotype;Population;Serotonin;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States Food and Drug Administration;Vals",Opioid-Related Disorders,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29431216,2018,Mast cell-neural interactions contribute to pain and itch.,"Mast cells are best recognized for their role in allergy and anaphylaxis, but increasing evidence supports their role in neurogenic inflammation leading to pain and itch. Mast cells act as a ""power house"" by releasing algogenic and pruritogenic mediators, which initiate a reciprocal communication with specific nociceptors on sensory nerve fibers. Consequently, nerve fibers release inflammatory and vasoactive neuropeptides, which in turn activate mast cells in a feedback mechanism, thus promoting a vicious cycle of mast cell and nociceptor activation leading to neurogenic inflammation and pain/pruritus. Mechanisms underlying mast cell differentiation, activation, and intercellular interactions with inflammatory, vascular, and neural systems are deeply influenced by their microenvironment, imparting enormous heterogeneity and complexity in understanding their contribution to pain and pruritus. Neurogenic inflammation is central to both pain and pruritus, but specific mediators released by mast cells to promote this process may vary depending upon their location, stimuli, underlying pathology, gender, and species. Therefore, in this review, we present the contribution of mast cells in pathological conditions, including distressing pruritus exacerbated by psychologic stress and experienced by the majority of patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis and in different pain syndromes due to mastocytosis, sickle cell disease, and cancer.","Anaphylaxis;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Cancer;Cell Communication;Cellular Microenvironment;Communication;Comprehension;Dermatitis, Atopic;Feedback;Gender;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Mast Cells;Mastocytosis;Nerve Fibers;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neuropeptides;Nociceptors;Pain;Pathology;Patients;Power, Psychological;Pruritus;Psoriasis;Review;Role;Stress, Psychological;Syndrome","Anaphylaxis;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cancer;Dermatitis, Atopic;Hypersensitivity;Mastocytosis;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain;Pruritus;Psoriasis;Syndrome",Immunol Rev,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29458047,2018,Effects of cytochrome P450 single nucleotide polymorphisms on methadone metabolism and pharmacodynamics.,"Methadone is a synthetic, long-acting opioid with a single chiral center forming two enantiomers, (R)-methadone and (S)-methadone, each having specific pharmacological actions. Concentrations of (R)- and (S)-methadone above therapeutic levels have the ability to cause serious, life-threatening, and fatal side effects. This toxicity can be due in part to the pharmacogenetics of an individual, which influences the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug. Methadone is primarily metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, predominately by CYP2B6, followed by CYP3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C18, 3A7, 2C8, 2C9, 3A5, and 1A2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within CYPs have the potential to play an important role in altering methadone metabolism and pharmacodynamics. Several SNPs in the CYP2B6, 3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A5 genes result in increases in methadone plasma concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance. In particular, carriers of CYP2B6*6/*6 may have a greater risk for detrimental adverse effects, as methadone metabolism and clearance are diminished in these individuals. CYP2B6*4, on the other hand, has been observed to decrease plasma concentrations of methadone due to increased methadone clearance. The involvement, contribution, and understanding the role of SNPs in CYP2B6, and other CYP genes, in methadone metabolism can improve the therapeutic uses of methadone in patient outcome and the development of personalized medicine.","Ability;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Comprehension;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Demethylation;Enzymes;Genes;Genetics;Hand;Humans;Life;Liver;Metabolism;Methadone;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacokinetics;Plasma;Play;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Precision Medicine;Risk;Role;Therapeutic Uses;Therapeutics",Opioid-Related Disorders,Biochem Pharmacol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29467623,2018,eIF4E Phosphorylation Influences Bdnf mRNA Translation in Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons.,"Plasticity in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that promotes pain requires activity-dependent mRNA translation. Protein synthesis inhibitors block the ability of many pain-promoting molecules to enhance excitability in DRG neurons and attenuate behavioral signs of pain plasticity. In line with this, we have recently shown that phosphorylation of the 5' cap-binding protein, eIF4E, plays a pivotal role in plasticity of DRG nociceptors in models of hyperalgesic priming. However, mRNA targets of eIF4E phosphorylation have not been elucidated in the DRG. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling from nociceptors in the DRG to spinal dorsal horn neurons is an important mediator of hyperalgesic priming. Regulatory mechanisms that promote pain plasticity via controlling BDNF expression that is involved in promoting pain plasticity have not been identified. We show that phosphorylation of eIF4E is paramount for Bdnf mRNA translation in the DRG. Bdnf mRNA translation is reduced in mice lacking eIF4E phosphorylation (eIF4ES209A ) and pro-nociceptive factors fail to increase BDNF protein levels in the DRGs of these mice despite robust upregulation of Bdnf-201 mRNA levels. Importantly, bypassing the DRG by giving intrathecal injection of BDNF in eIF4ES209A mice creates a strong hyperalgesic priming response that is normally absent or reduced in these mice. We conclude that eIF4E phosphorylation-mediated translational control of BDNF expression is a key mechanism for nociceptor plasticity leading to hyperalgesic priming.","Ability;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Ganglia, Spinal;Injections, Intrathecal;Mice;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Phosphorylation;Play;Posterior Horn Cells;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Synthesis Inhibitors;Proteins;RNA Cap-Binding Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Role;Up-Regulation",Ganglion Cysts;Pain,Front Cell Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29497363,2018,Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptide Elicits Peripheral TRPV1-dependent Mechanical Hypersensitivity.,"Bone metastasis in breast, prostate and lung cancers often leads to chronic pain, which is poorly managed by existing analgesics. The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie chronic pain associated with bone-metastasized cancers are not well understood, but sensitization of peripheral nociceptors by tumor microenvironment factors has been demonstrated to be important. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is highly expressed in bone-metastasized breast and prostate cancers, and is critical to growth and proliferation of these tumors in the bone tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have suggested that PTHrP could sensitize nociceptive sensory neurons, resulting in peripheral pain hypersensitivity. In this study, we found that PTHrP induces both heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, that are dependent on the pain-transducing transient receptor potential channel family vanilloid, member-1 (TRPV1), but not the mechano-transducing TRPV4 and TRPA1 ion channels. Functional ratiometric Ca2+ imaging and voltage-clamp electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse DRG neurons show significant potentiation of TRPV1, but not TRPA1 or TRPV4 channel activation by PTHrP. Interestingly, PTHrP exposure led to the slow and sustained activation of TRPV1, in the absence of any exogenous channel agonist, and is dependent on the expression of the type-1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1), as well as on downstream phosphorylation of the channel by protein kinase C (PKC). Accordingly, local administration of specific small-molecule antagonists of TRPV1 to mouse hindpaws after the development of PTHrP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity led to its significant attenuation. Collectively, our findings suggest that PTHrP/PTH1-mediated flow activation of TRPV1 channel contributes at least in part to the development and maintenance of peripheral mechanical pain hypersensitivity, and could therefore constitute a mechanism for nociceptor sensitization in the context of metastatic bone cancer pain.","Administration;Analgesics;Bone Cancer;Bones;Breast;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Family;Growth;Heat;Hypersensitivity;Ion Channels;Lead;Lung Cancer;Maintenance;Mice;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasms;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein;Phosphorylation;Prostate;Prostate Cancer;Protein Kinase C;Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1;Sensory Receptor Cells;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Tumor Microenvironment",Bone Cancer;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Hypersensitivity;Lung Cancer;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasms;Pain;Prostate Cancer,Front Cell Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29561359,2018,Comparative transcriptome profiling of the human and mouse dorsal root ganglia: an RNA-seq-based resource for pain and sensory neuroscience research.,"Molecular neurobiological insight into human nervous tissues is needed to generate next-generation therapeutics for neurological disorders such as chronic pain. We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (∼140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We present our work as an online, searchable repository (https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), creating a valuable resource for the community. Our analyses provide insight into DRG biology for guiding development of novel therapeutics and a blueprint for cross-species transcriptomic analyses.","Adult;Animals;Axonal Transport;Axons;Base Sequence;Biology;Chronic Pain;Coding;Community;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Family;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genes;Humans;Ion Channels;Mice;Nerve Tissue;Nervous System Diseases;Neurosciences;Organ Donors;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;RNA-Seq;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Research;Resources;Rodentia;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Therapeutics;Tibial Nerve;Tissues;Transcription Factors;Transcriptome;Work",Chronic Pain;Nervous System Diseases;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29642237,2018,Association Between the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria and Multisite Pain Sensitivity in Knee Osteoarthritis.,"The present study evaluated the relationship between the 2011 American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia (FM) survey criteria and quantitative sensory testing (QST). Patients with knee osteoarthritis scheduled to undergo knee arthroplasty completed the FM survey criteria and self-report measures assessing clinical symptoms. Patients also underwent a battery of QST procedures at the surgical knee and remote body sites, including pressure algometry, conditioned pain modulation, and temporal summation. All assessments were completed before surgery. FM survey criteria were used to calculate a continuous FM score indicating FM severity. A total of 129 patients were analyzed. Of these, 52.7% were female, 93.8% were Caucasian, and 3.8% met the FM survey criteria for FM classification. Mean age for females (63.6 y) and males (64.7 y) was similar. Females and males differed significantly in nearly every outcome, including FM severity, clinical pain, anxiety, depression, and pressure pain sensitivity. In females, FM scores significantly correlated with pressure pain sensitivity, but not conditioned pain modulation or temporal summation, such that increased sensitivity was associated with greater FM severity at all body sites examined. In addition, as FM scores increased, the association between pain sensitivity at the surgical knee and pain sensitivity at remote body sites also increased. No relationship between FM score and QST was observed in males. We demonstrated an association between diffuse hyperalgesia as measured by QST and FM severity in females with knee osteoarthritis. These results suggest that the FM survey criteria may represent a marker of pain centralization in females with potential utility in clinical decision making.","Adult;Aged;Anxiety;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Association;Classification;Clinical Decision-Making;Cohort Studies;Depression;Female;Fibromyalgia;General Surgery;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Knee;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain Threshold;Patients;Pressure;Procedures;Rheumatology;Self Report;Sensitivity;Sex Characteristics;Surveys","Fibromyalgia;Hyperalgesia;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain",Clin J Pain,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29692877,2018,Predictors of Transitioning to Incident Chronic Opioid Therapy Among Working-Age Adults in the United States.,"Opioids have been prescribed and used for chronic noncancer pain at prolific rates in the United States during the past 2 decades. Patients who transition to incident chronic opioid therapy are at increased risk for significant negative health consequences, including cardiovascular risk, endocrine disorders, opioid use disorder, and death. To identify the leading predictors associated with transitioning to incident chronic opioid therapy among working-age adults without cancer. This retrospective observational cohort study is based on medical and pharmacy claims of a nationally representative sample of adults enrolled in commercial health insurance plans. Standard parametric (logistic regressions) and nonparametric methods based on a decision tree were used for prediction. To facilitate comparison with the available published literature, we also present adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 10% random sample of 491,442 patients included in the study who were working-age adults (age, 28-63 years) were insured in a commercial health plan, did not have cancer, and initiated opioid therapy between January 2007 and May 2015. Transition to incident chronic opioid therapy was defined as having claims for at least a 90-day supply of opioids within 120 days after the index date (ie, initiation of opioid therapy). Predictive models used for the analysis comprised a comprehensive list of factors available in the claims data, including opioid regimen characteristics, pain conditions, physical and mental health conditions, concomitant medications use (ie, benzodiazepine, stimulants, nonopioid analgesics, and polypharmacy), patient characteristics, and health insurance type. In our sample, the transition to incident chronic opioid therapy was 1.3% and pain-specific diagnoses were documented for only one-third (31.7%) of patients. The 4 leading predictors of chronic opioid therapy were opioid duration of action (AOR, 12.28; 95% CI, 8.06-18.72), the parent opioid compound (eg, tramadol vs codeine; AOR, 7.26; 95% CI, 5.20-10.13), the presence of conditions that are very likely to cause chronic pain (AOR, 5.47; 95% CI, 3.89-7.68), and drug use disorders (AOR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.53-6.40). The initial opioid regimen's characteristics are powerful predictors of chronic opioid therapy. Predictive algorithms created from readily available claims data can be used to develop real-time predictions of the future risk for a patient's transition to chronic opioid use.","Adult;Algorithms;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Benzodiazepine;Cancer;Cardiovascular Risk;Chronic Pain;Codeine;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Database;Dates;Death;Decision Trees;Diagnosis;Drug Use Disorders;Future;Health;Index;Insurance, Health;Literature;Logistic Regression;Mental Health;Methods;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pain;Parents;Patient Transition;Patients;Pharmacoepidemiology;Pharmacy;Polypharmacy;Risk;Standards;Supplies;Therapeutics;Time;Tramadol;United States",Cancer;Chronic Pain;Death;Drug Use Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Pain,Am Health Drug Benefits,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29724954,2018,Piezo2 channel-Merkel cell signaling modulates the conversion of touch to itch.,"The somatosensory system relays many signals ranging from light touch to pain and itch. Touch is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic sensations such as mechanical itch (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the touch receptors in the skin. Targeted genetic deletion of Merkel cells and associated mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels in the skin was sufficient to produce alloknesis. Chemogenetic activation of Merkel cells protected against alloknesis in dry skin. This study reveals a previously unknown function of the cutaneous touch receptors and may provide insight into the development of alloknesis.","Aging;Animals;Awareness;Communication;Disease;Gene Deletion;Genetics;Ion Channels;Light;Mechanotransduction, Cellular;Merkel Cells;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Mutant Strains;Pain;Pruritus;Sensation;Skin;Touch",Pain;Pruritus,Science,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29774442,2018,Integrated Models of Care for Individuals with Opioid Use Disorder: How Do We Prevent HIV and HCV?,"To describe models of integrated and co-located care for opioid use disorder (OUD), hepatitis C (HCV), and HIV. The design and scale-up of multidisciplinary care models that engage, retain, and treat individuals with HIV, HCV, and OUD are critical to preventing continued spread of HIV and HCV. We identified 17 models within primary care (N = 3), HIV specialty care (N = 5), opioid treatment programs (N = 6), transitional clinics (N = 2), and community-based harm reduction programs (N = 1), as well as two emerging models. Key components of such models are the provision of (1) medication-assisted treatment for OUD, (2) HIV and HCV treatment, (3) HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, and (4) behavioral health services. Research is needed to understand differences in effectiveness between co-located and fully integrated care, combat the deleterious racial and ethnic legacies of the ""War on Drugs,"" and inform the delivery of psychiatric care.

29778769,2018,Mandatory review of a prescription drug monitoring program and impact on opioid and benzodiazepine dispensing.,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether Ohio House Bill 341, which mandated the use of Ohio's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), was an effective regulatory strategy to reduce opioid and benzodiazepine dispensing. Secondary analysis of Ohio's PDMP data on prescription opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed from November 2014 to March 2017. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to determine if there was a significant change in the quantity of opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed. After HB341 became effective in April 2015, there was a statistically significant decrease in the monthly quantity (number of pills) opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed in Ohio. There was a modest increase in the mean days' supply of opioids and no change in the mean morphine equivalent dose. Legislation in Ohio requiring prescribers to check the PDMP was effective in reducing the quantity of opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed.","Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Drug Utilization Review;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Legislation;Morphine;Ohio;Opioids;Policy;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Review;Supplies",,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29784053,2018,A small molecule p53 activator attenuates Fanconi anemia leukemic stem cell proliferation.,"Although p53 mutations are common in solid tumors, such mutations are found at a lower frequency in hematologic malignancies. In the genetic disorder Fanconi anemia (FA), p53 has been proposed as an important pathophysiological factor for two important hematologic hallmarks of the disease: bone marrow failure and leukemogenesis. Here we show that low levels of the p53 protein enhance the capacity of leukemic stem cells from FA patients to repopulate immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, boosting p53 protein levels with the use of the small molecule Nutlin-3 reduced leukemia burden in recipient mice. These results demonstrate that the level of p53 protein plays a crucial role in FA leukemogenesis.",Bone Marrow Diseases;Cell Proliferation;Fanconi Anemia;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hereditary Diseases;Humans;Leukemia;Mice;Mutation;Neoplasms;Patients;Play;Proteins;Role;Stem Cells;Tumor Suppressor Protein p53,Bone Marrow Diseases;Fanconi Anemia;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hereditary Diseases;Leukemia;Neoplasms,Stem Cell Res Ther,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29784589,2018,Tolerability and blinding of 4x1 high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) at two and three milliamps.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an in-demand form of neuromodulation generally regarded as safe and well tolerated. However, few studies have examined the safety, tolerability, or blinding of High Definition (HD-) tDCS, especially in older adults and at stimulation intensities of 2 milliamps (mA) or greater. We examined the rates of serious adverse events and common side effects to establish safety and tolerability, respectively, in HD-tDCS. Blinding was evaluated using participants' accuracy in correctly stating their condition (i.e., active or sham). The sample included 101 older adults (Mage = 69.69, SD = 8.33; Meduc = 16.27, SD = 2.42) who participated in our double blind randomized controlled studies or in case studies that used HD-tDCS for 20-30 min at 2 mA (n = 66, 31 active) or 3 mA (n = 35, 20 active). Participants completed a standardized side effect questionnaire and were asked whether they received active or sham stimulation at the end of each session. There were no serious adverse events and no participants withdrew, suggesting that HD-tDCS meets basic safety parameters. Tolerability was comparable between active and sham HD-tDCS regardless of intensity (2 mA and 3 mA) in first session (allp &gt; .09). Tingling was the most commonly endorsed item (59% active; 56% sham) followed by burning sensation (51% active; 50% sham), the majority of which were mild in nature. ""Severe"" ratings were reported in fewer than 4% of sessions. Blinding appeared adequate since there were no significant group differences between individuals correctly stating their stimulation condition (χ2 = 0.689, p = .679). The above tolerability and blinding findings generally persisted when multiple session data (i.e., 186 total sessions) were considered. HD-tDCS appears well-tolerated and safe with effective sham-control in older adults, even at 3 mA. These data support the use of HD-tDCS in randomized controlled trials and clinical translation efforts.","Adult;Aged;Aphasia, Primary Progressive;Case Study;Cognitive Dysfunction;Double-Blind Method;Female;Form;Headache;Humans;Leukoencephalopathies;Male;Middle Aged;Nature;Pain;Questionnaires;Randomized Controlled Trial;Safety;Sensation;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Surveys and Questionnaires;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation;Translations","Aphasia, Primary Progressive;Cognitive Dysfunction;Headache;Leukoencephalopathies;Pain;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Brain Stimul,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29913243,2018,"Spinal Inhibition of P2XR or p38 Signaling Disrupts Hyperalgesic Priming in Male, but not Female, Mice.","Recent studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphisms in the mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic pain. Here we tested the hypothesis that microglia might preferentially regulate hyperalgesic priming in male mice. We based this hypothesis on evidence that microglia preferentially contribute to neuropathic pain in male mice via ionotropic purinergic receptor (P2XR) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) signaling. Mice given a single-priming injection of the soluble human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) and then a second injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which unmasks hyperalgesic priming, shows a significant increase in levels of activated microglia at 3 h following the PGE2 injection in both male and female mice. There was no change in microglia following PGE2. Intrathecal injection of the P2X3/4 inhibitor TNP-ATP blocked the initial response to IL-6r in both males and females, but only blocked hyperalgesic priming in male mice. Intrathecally applied p38 inhibitor, skepinone, had no effect on the initial response to IL-6r but attenuated hyperalgesic priming in males only. Neither TNP-ATP nor skepinone could reverse priming once it had already been established in male mice suggesting that these pathways must be inhibited early in the development of hyperalgesic priming to have an effect. Our work is consistent with previous findings that P2XR and p38 inhibition can lead to male-specific effects on pain behaviors in mice. However, given that we did not observe microglial activation at time points where these drugs were effective, our work also questions whether these effects can be completely attributed to microglia.","Adenosine Triphosphate;Animals;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Dinoprostone;Female;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Injections;Injections, Intrathecal;Interleukin-6;Lead;Male;Mice;Microglia;Motor Activity;Neuralgia;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Receptors, Interleukin-6;Receptors, Purinergic;Receptors, Purinergic P2Y;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Signal Transduction;Time;Work;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Neuralgia;Pain,Neuroscience,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

Participants completed self-report surveys and QST within the month before breast surgery. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured bilaterally at each trapezius with a manual QST algometer. PPT values were split, yielding low, moderate, and high pain sensitivity subgroups. Subgroup self-reported characteristics were compared using Spearman's correlation, chi-square, and one-way analysis of variance. Lower PPT (higher sensitivity) was associated with higher levels of pain interference and maladaptive pain cognitions. The high-sensitivity group reported higher pain severities, interference, and catastrophizing and lower belief in internal locus of pain control than the low-sensitivity group.

The study design was a cross-sectional survey of emergency department (ED) medical directors, or appropriate person identified by the hospital, perception of the impact of the Ohio ED Opioid Prescribing Guidelines on their departments practice. All hospitals with an ED in Ohio were contacted throughout October and November 2016. Distribution followed Dillman's Tailored Design Method, augmented with telephone recruitment. Hospital chief executive officers were contacted when necessary to encourage ED participation. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the impact of opioid prescribing policies on prescribing practices. A 92% response rate was obtained (150/163 EDs). In total, 112 (75%) of the respondents stated that their ED has an opioid prescribing policy, is adopting one or is implementing prescribing guidelines without a specific policy. Of these 112 EDs, 81 (72%) based their policy on the Ohio ED Opioid Prescribing Guidelines. The majority of respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the prescribing guidelines have increased the use of the prescription drug monitoring programme (86%) and have reduced inappropriate opioid prescribing (71%). This study showed that the Ohio ED Opioid Prescribing Guidelines have been widely disseminated and that the majority of EDs in Ohio are using them to develop local policies. The majority of respondents believed that the Ohio opioid prescribing guidelines reduced inappropriate opioid prescribing. However, prescribing practices still varied greatly between EDs.","Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Chief Executive Officers, Hospital;Controlled Substances;Cross-Sectional Studies;Emergencies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Guideline;Guideline Adherence;Health Care;Health Policy;Hospitals;Humans;Inappropriate Prescribing;Methods;Ohio;Opioids;Perception;Persons;Physician Executives;Policy;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Respondents;Self Report;Statistics;Telephone",,BMJ Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
29971163,2018,Burden of Depression among Working-Age Adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"This study estimated the excess clinical, humanistic, and economic burden associated with depression among working-age adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among working-age (18 to 64 years) RA patients with depression (N = 647) and without depression (N = 2,015) using data from the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for the years 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. Overall, 25.8% had depression. In adjusted analyses, adults with RA and depression compared to those without depression were significantly more likely to have pain interference with normal work (severe pain: AOR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.55, 3.18), functional limitations (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.61, 2.94), and lower mental health HRQoL scores. Adults with RA and depression had significantly higher annual healthcare expenditures ($14,752 versus 10,541, p &lt; .001) and out-of-pocket spending burden. Adults with RA and depression were more likely to be unemployed and among employed adults, those with depression had a significantly higher number of missed work days annually and higher lost annual wages due to missed work days. This study highlights the importance of effectively managing depression in routine clinical practice of RA patients to reduce pain and functional limitations, improve quality of life, and lower direct and indirect healthcare costs.","Adult;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression;Economics;Expenditures;Expenditures, Out-of-Pocket;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Mental Health;Overall;Pain;Patients;Quality of Life;Surveys;Wages;Work","Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Pain",Arthritis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30215622,2018,Executive (dys)function after stroke: special considerations for behavioral pharmacology.,"Stroke is a worldwide leading cause of death and long-term disability with concurrent secondary consequences that are largely comprised of mood dysfunction, as well as sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. This review focuses on the cognitive deficits associated with stroke specific to executive dysfunction (including decision making, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) in humans, nonhuman primates, and additional animal models. Further, we review some of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the individual components of executive dysfunction and their neuroanatomical substrates after stroke, with an emphasis on the changes that occur during biogenic monoamine neurotransmission. We concentrate primarily on changes in the catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and serotonergic systems at the levels of neurotransmitter synthesis, distribution, reuptake, and degradation. We also discuss potential secondary stroke-related behavioral deficits (specifically, poststroke depression as well as drug-abuse potential and addiction) and their relationship with stroke-induced deficits in executive function, an especially important consideration given that the average age of the human stroke population is decreasing. In the final sections, we address pharmacological considerations for the treatment of ischemia and the subsequent functional impairment, as well as current limitations in the field of stroke and executive function research.","Address;Animals;Biogenic Monoamines;Cause of Death;Cognition Disorders;Decision Making;Depression;Drug Abuse;Executive Function;Humans;Ischemia;Memory, Short-Term;Models, Animal;Mood;Neurotransmitters;Pharmacology;Pliability;Population;Primates;Psychopharmacology;Research;Review;Stroke;Synaptic Transmission;Therapeutics",Cognition Disorders;Death;Drug Abuse;Ischemia;Stroke,Behav Pharmacol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30245732,2018,"Effects of Mantra Meditation versus Music Listening on Knee Pain, Function, and Related Outcomes in Older Adults with Knee Osteoarthritis: An Exploratory Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT).","Disease-modifying treatments for OA remain elusive, and commonly used medications can have serious side effects. Although meditation and music listening (ML) have been shown to improve outcomes in certain chronic pain populations, research in OA is sparse. In this pilot RCT, we explore the effects of two mind-body practices, mantra meditation (MM) and ML, on knee pain, function, and related outcomes in adults with knee OA. Twenty-two older ambulatory adults diagnosed with knee OA were randomized to a MM (N=11) or ML program (N=11) and asked to practice 15-20 minutes, twice daily for 8 weeks. Core outcomes included knee pain (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS] and Numeric Rating Scale), knee function (KOOS), and perceived OA severity (Patient Global Assessment). Additional outcomes included perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and health-related quality of life (QOL, SF-36). Participants were assessed at baseline and following completion of the program. Twenty participants (91%) completed the study (9 MM, 11 ML). Compliance was excellent; participants completed an average of 12.1±0.83 sessions/week. Relative to baseline, participants in both groups demonstrated improvement post-intervention in all core outcomes, including knee pain, function, and perceived OA severity, as well as improvement in mood, perceived stress, and QOL (Physical Health) (p's≤0.05). Relative to ML, the MM group showed greater improvements in overall mood and sleep (p's≤0.04), QOL-Mental Health (p&lt;0.07), kinesiophobia (p=0.09), and two domains of the KOOS (p's&lt;0.09). Findings of this exploratory RCT suggest that a simple MM and, possibly, ML program may be effective in reducing knee pain and dysfunction, decreasing stress, and improving mood, sleep, and QOL in adults with knee OA.","Adult;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Compliance;Disease;Health;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Index;Knee;Knee Injuries;Meditation;Mental Health;Mood;Music;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Overall;Pain;Patients;Pilots;Population;Program;Relatives;Research;Scales;Sleep;Therapeutics","Chronic Pain;Knee Injuries;Osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis, Knee;Pain",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30265442,2018,Mouse Models of Pain in Sickle Cell Disease.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that impacts millions of individuals worldwide. SCD is characterized by debilitating pain that can begin during infancy and may continue to increase throughout life. This pain can be both acute and chronic. A characteristic feature specific to acute pain in SCD occurs during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) due to the blockade of capillaries with sickle red blood cells. The acute pain of VOC is intense, unpredictable, and requires hospitalization. Chronic pain occurs in a significant population with SCD. Treatment options for sickle pain are limited and primarily involve the use of opioids. However, long-term opioid use is associated with numerous side effects. Thus, pain management in SCD remains a major challenge. Humanized transgenic mice expressing exclusively human sickle hemoglobin show features of pain and pathobiology similar to that in patients with SCD. Therefore, these mice offer the potential for investigating the mechanisms of pain in SCD and allow for development of novel targeted analgesic therapies. © 2018 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","Acute Pain;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Blood;Capillaries;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Electrophoresis, Cellulose Acetate;Erythrocytes;Genetics;Hemoglobin, Sickle;Hospitalization;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypoxia;Isoelectric Focusing;Life;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Population;Sons;Therapeutics","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hypoxia;Pain",Curr Protoc Neurosci,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30271039,2018,A Short Weight Loss Intervention in a Neurosurgical Subspecialist Clinical Setting.,"The relationship between back pain and obesity is well characterized; therefore, the neurosurgical consultant visit for back pain may be a key interventional opportunity for weight loss. The aim of this project was to evaluate efficacy of an educational intervention for back pain. A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate effectiveness of an educational intervention (Show patient's own MRI, Explain degenerative disc disease, Relate to weight issues, Reference other weight-related comorbidities, and Encourage a plan of action for weight loss [SERRE]). This has been performed since 2014 for patients presenting to the first author's neurosurgical spine clinic with nonsurgical back pain and body mass index (BMI) over 35. The average BMI was 50.7. Fifty-five percent of patients had additional weight-related comorbidities. After SERRE intervention, 82% of patients were open to weight loss interventions. However, only 22% of patients went on to follow-up with a formal weight management program and only 9% of patients went on to have a documented weight loss. The lack of success was largely attributed to social issues and severe medical comorbidities within the specific population. Incorporation of patient education regarding the relationship of weight loss to back pain and other weight-related comorbidities is well received in a rural specialist consultation setting. Improved communication with primary care physicians regarding this message and further supportive actions may improve follow-through, and therefore success of ultimate weight loss interventions.","Back Pain;Body Mass Index;Communication;Comorbidity;Consultants;Consultation;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Obesity;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Physicians, Primary Care;Population;Program;Retrospective Studies;Specialists;Spine;Weight Loss;Weights",Back Pain;Intervertebral Disc Degeneration;Obesity;Weight Loss,J Neurosci Rural Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30342861,2019,Emergency Physicians' Perception of Barriers and Facilitators for Adopting an Opioid Prescribing Guideline in Ohio: A Qualitative Interview Study.,"Ohio has the fifth highest rate of prescription opioid overdose deaths in the United States. One strategy implemented to address this concern is a state-wide opioid prescribing guideline in the emergency department (ED). Our aim was to explore emergency physicians' perceptions on barriers and strategies for the Ohio ED opioid prescribing guideline. Semi-structured interviews with emergency physicians in Ohio were conducted from October to December 2016. Emergency physicians were recruited through the American College of Emergency Physicians Ohio State Chapter. The interview guide explored issues related to the implementation of the guidelines. Interview data were transcribed and thematically analyzed and coded using a scheme of inductively determined labels. In total, we conducted 20 interviews. Of these, 11 were also the ED medical director at their institution. Main themes we identified were: 1) increased organizational responsibility, 2) improved prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) integration, 3) concerns regarding patient satisfaction scores, and 4) increased patient involvement. In addition, some physicians wanted the guidelines to contain more clinical information and be worded more strongly against opioid prescribing. Emergency physicians felt patient satisfaction scores were perceived to negatively impact opioid prescribing guidelines, as they may encourage physicians to prescribe opioids. Furthermore, some participants reported that this is compounded if the emergency physicians' income was linked to their patient satisfaction score. Emergency physicians interviewed generally supported the state-wide opioid prescribing guideline but felt hospitals needed to take additional organizational responsibility for addressing inappropriate opioid prescribing.","Address;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Death;Drug Prescriptions;Emergencies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Guideline;Guideline Adherence;Guidelines as Topic;Hospitals;Humans;Income;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Male;Middle Aged;Ohio;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patient Participation;Patient Satisfaction;Perception;Physician Executives;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Qualitative Research;United States",Death;Opiate Overdose,J Emerg Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

30459229,2019,Nociceptor Translational Profiling Reveals the Ragulator-Rag GTPase Complex as a Critical Generator of Neuropathic Pain.,"Nociceptors, sensory neurons in the DRG that detect damaging or potentially damaging stimuli, are key drivers of neuropathic pain. Injury to these neurons causes activation of translation regulation signaling, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK) eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E pathways. This is a mechanism driving changes in excitability of nociceptors that is critical for the generation of chronic pain states; however, the mRNAs that are translated to lead to this plasticity have not been elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, we used translating ribosome affinity purification in male and female mice to comprehensively characterize mRNA translation in Scn10a-positive nociceptors in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN) caused by paclitaxel treatment. This unbiased method creates a new resource for the field, confirms many findings in the CIPN literature and also find extensive evidence for new target mechanisms that may cause CIPN. We provide evidence that an underlying mechanism of CIPN is sustained mTORC1 activation driven by MNK1-eIF4E signaling. RagA, a GTPase controlling mTORC1 activity, is identified as a novel target of MNK1-eIF4E signaling. This demonstrates a novel translation regulation signaling circuit wherein MNK1-eIF4E activity drives mTORC1 via control of RagA translation. CIPN and RagA translation are strongly attenuated by genetic ablation of eIF4E phosphorylation, MNK1 elimination or treatment with the MNK inhibitor eFT508. We identify a novel translational circuit for the genesis of neuropathic pain caused by chemotherapy with important implications for therapeutics.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuropathic pain affects up to 10% of the population, but its underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, leading to poor treatment outcomes. We used translating ribosome affinity purification technology to create a comprehensive translational profile of DRG nociceptors in naive mice and at the peak of neuropathic pain induced by paclitaxel treatment. We reveal new insight into how mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 is activated in neuropathic pain pointing to a key role of MNK1-eIF4E-mediated translation of a complex of mRNAs that control mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling at the surface of the lysosome. We validate this finding using genetic and pharmacological techniques. Our work strongly suggests that MNK1-eIF4E signaling drives CIPN and that a drug in human clinical trials, eFT508, may be a new therapeutic for neuropathic pain.","Address;Affect;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Drive;Drug Therapy;Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E;Eukaryotic Initiation Factors;Female;GTP Phosphohydrolases;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetics;Humans;Injuries;Knowledge;Lead;Literature;Lysosomes;Male;Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1;Methods;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Mice, Transgenic;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;NAV1.8 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Neuralgia;Neurons;News;Nociceptors;Paclitaxel;Pain Measurement;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Population;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;RNA, Messenger;Regulation;Resources;Ribosomes;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Technology;Therapeutics;Translating;Translations;Treatment Outcome;Work",Chronic Pain;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30477398,2019,Phenome-wide association study identifies dsDNA as a driver of major organ involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dsDNA antibodies are associated with renal disease. Less is known about comorbidities in patients without dsDNA or other autoantibodies. Using an electronic health record (EHR) SLE cohort, we employed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) that scans across billing codes to compare comorbidities in SLE patients with and without autoantibodies. We used our validated algorithm to identify SLE subjects. Autoantibody status was defined as ever positive for dsDNA, RNP, Smith, SSA and SSB. PheWAS was performed in antibody positive vs. negative SLE patients adjusting for age and race and using a false discovery rate of 0.05. We identified 1097 SLE subjects. In the PheWAS of dsDNA positive vs. negative subjects, dsDNA positive subjects were more likely to have nephritis ( p = 2.33 × 10-9) and renal failure ( p = 1.85 × 10-5). After adjusting for sex, race, age and other autoantibodies, dsDNA was independently associated with nephritis and chronic kidney disease. Those patients negative for dsDNA, RNP, SSA and SSB negative subjects were all more likely to have billing codes for sleep, pain and mood disorders.

30477765,2019,Graph theory analysis reveals how sickle cell disease impacts neural networks of patients with more severe disease.,Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder associated with many life-threatening comorbidities including cerebral stroke and chronic pain. The long-term effects of this disease may therefore affect the global brain network which is not clearly understood. We performed graph theory analysis of functional networks using non-invasive fMRI and high resolution EEG on thirty-one SCD patients and sixteen healthy controls. Resting state data were analyzed to determine differences between controls and patients with less severe and more severe sickle cell related pain. fMRI results showed that patients with higher pain severity had lower clustering coefficients and local efficiency. The neural network of the more severe patient group behaved like a random network when performing a targeted attack network analysis. EEG results showed the beta1 band had similar results to fMRI resting state data. Our data show that SCD affects the brain on a global level and that graph theory analysis can differentiate between patients with different levels of pain severity.,"Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Blood;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cells;Chronic Pain;Cluster Analysis;Comorbidity;Disease;Efficiency;Electroencephalography;Female;Functional Neuroimaging;Humans;Life;Longterm Effects;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Nerve Net;Neural Pathways;Pain;Patients;Rest;Stroke;Young Adult;fMRI","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Pain;Stroke",Neuroimage Clin,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30543904,2019,Exploring the potential role of mesocorticolimbic circuitry in motivation for and adherence to chronic pain self-management interventions.,"Adherence to pain self-management strategies is associated with favorable psychobehavioral outcomes among individuals with chronic pain. Substantive adherence to treatments teaching these adaptive skills often proves challenging, resulting in poor individual and societal outcomes. Evidence demonstrates motivation for behavior change as a key predictor of treatment adherence. Despite behavioral techniques that target motivation, however, nonadherence persists as a barrier to positive clinical outcomes in chronic pain. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying treatment motivation might highlight novel avenues for augmentative therapies. The purpose of this review is to present theory and evidence that the mesocorticolimbic system (i.e., brain circuitry associated with reward processing and motivation) contributes to treatment motivation among chronic pain patients, ultimately influencing adherence. We review evidence for motivation as a key adherence determinant, detail neuroimaging findings relating mesocorticolimbic circuitry and motivation, and discuss data supporting mesocorticolimbic dysfunction among chronic pain patients. We propose a neurobehavioral model for adherence to pain self-management interventions, listing testable hypotheses. Finally, we discuss potential research and intervention implications from the proposed model.",Animals;Behavior;Brain;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Health Behavior;Humans;Motivation;Neuroimaging;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Research;Review;Reward;Role;Self-Management;Teaching;Therapeutics;Treatment Adherence,Chronic Pain;Pain,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30556731,2019,Cognitive dysfunction in individuals with cocaine use disorder: Potential moderating factors and pharmacological treatments.,"It is well-documented in the literature that individuals repeatedly exposed to cocaine exhibit cognitive impairment and that cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes in those with cocaine use disorder (CUD). Specific deficits related to attention, episodic memory, working memory, and executive functioning are the most common deficits noted in this population. Given that cognitive impairment is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes in those with CUD, identifying possible moderating factors contributing to and/or exacerbating cocaine-related cognitive deficits is of great importance. Some of these factors may include premorbid intellectual functioning, cocaine use patterns, polysubstance use, comorbid emotional symptoms, and sleep dysfunction. It is plausible that by identifying moderating factors impacting cognition, behavioral interventions can then be modified accordingly and/or treatment regimens can be augmented with pharmacological interventions (e.g., cognitive enhancing agents), leading to a reduction in treatment attrition and improved treatment outcomes. The currently available treatments for CUD are mainly behavioral with variable efficacy, and even though there have been great preclinical and clinical research efforts focused on medication development for CUD, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for CUD. A description of some of the several potential moderating factors, along with some pharmacological treatments which have been shown to ameliorate, at least to some extent, cognitive dysfunction in those with CUD are discussed.

30560199,2018,Opioid use and the presence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among elderly Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with chronic pain conditions.,"There is scant literature on the use of opioids among community-dwelling elderly with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We adopted a retrospective, cross-sectional study design using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data from 2006 to 2013. The study sample included elderly community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who were diagnosed with chronic pain conditions and had Medicare fee-for-service plans for the entire year. We conducted bivariate χ2 test and multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between opioid use and ADRD status. The study sample included 19,347 Medicare beneficiaries; 7.7% of them had ADRD. We found no statistically significant difference in opioid use by ADRD status in the unadjusted analysis; however, controlling for various factors, those with ADRD had lower odds of opioid use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.71, 0.93) than those without ADRD.

30598866,2018,Death Ambivalence and Treatment Seeking: Suicidality in Opiate Addiction.,"Rates of suicide and opiate overdose have recently skyrocketed in the United States. In light of impulsivity and impaired motivation common in people with substance use disorders, suicidality is common in addiction. Chart review surveys indicate two primary suicidal populations that are important to distinguish for clinical practice and healthcare policy. One group is heavily composed of people with SUDs, in whom chronic compulsive use fosters a numb ambivalence about death (low death intentionality). Many of these individuals with opiate use disorder (OUD) exaggerate suicidality to get prompt psychiatric care to treat the OUD. The second group is composed of those who have co-morbid psychiatric disorders and/or chronic pain who have a higher intent to die consistent with traditionally understood suicide risk factors. We contend that easier access to outpatient opiate agonist treatment would avoid unnecessary hospitalizations for death-ambivalent OUD patients, and for OUD patients in either group. First line treatment with an opioid agonist has high potential to effectively treat suicidal ideation as a secondary benefit.",Chart;Chronic Pain;Death;Health Policy;Hospitalization;Impulsive Behavior;Light;Mental Disorders;Motivation;Opiate Alkaloids;Opiate Dependence;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Persons;Population;Review;Risk Factors;Substance Use Disorders;Suicidal Ideation;Suicide;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States,Chronic Pain;Death;Mental Disorders;Opiate Dependence;Opiate Overdose;Substance Use Disorders,Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30610108,2019,"Cortactin Phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 2 Regulates Actin-Related Protein 2/3 Complex Activity, Invadopodia Function, and Tumor Cell Invasion.","Malregulation of the actin cytoskeleton enhances tumor cell motility and invasion. The actin-binding protein cortactin facilitates branched actin network formation through activation of the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex. Increased cortactin expression due to gene amplification is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers, corresponding with elevated tumor progression and poor patient outcome. Arp2/3 complex activation is responsible for driving increased migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by governing invadopodia formation and activity. Although cortactin-mediated activation of Arp2/3 complex and invadopodia regulation has been well established, signaling pathways responsible for governing cortactin binding to Arp2/3 are unknown and potentially present a new avenue for anti-invasive therapeutic targeting. Here we identify casein kinase (CK) 2α phosphorylation of cortactin as a negative regulator of Arp2/3 binding. CK2α directly phosphorylates cortactin at a conserved threonine (T24) adjacent to the canonical Arp2/3 binding motif. Phosphorylation of cortactin T24 by CK2α impairs the ability of cortactin to bind Arp2/3 and activate actin nucleation. Decreased invadopodia activity is observed in HNSCC cells with expression of CK2α phosphorylation-null cortactin mutants, shRNA-mediated CK2α knockdown, and with the CK2α inhibitor Silmitasertib. Silmitasertib inhibits HNSCC collective invasion in tumor spheroids and orthotopic tongue tumors in mice. Collectively these data suggest that CK2α-mediated cortactin phosphorylation at T24 is critical in regulating cortactin binding to Arp2/3 complex and pro-invasive activity, identifying a potential targetable mechanism for impairing HNSCC invasion. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies a new signaling pathway that contributes to enhancing cancer cell invasion.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/17/4/987/F1.large.jpg.","Ability;Actin Cytoskeleton;Actin-Binding Proteins;Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex;Actins;Animals;Cancer;Casein Kinase II;Casein Kinases;Cell Line, Tumor;Cells;Cortactin;Extracellular Matrix;Gene Amplification;HEK293 Cells;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Heterografts;Humans;Locomotion, Cell;Mice;Mice, Inbred NOD;Mice, SCID;Neoplasm Invasiveness;Neoplasms;News;Patients;Phosphorylation;Podosomes;Proteins;Regulation;Short Hairpin RNA;Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck;Therapeutics;Threonine;Tongue",Cancer;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Neoplasm Invasiveness;Neoplasms;Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck,Mol Cancer Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30738871,2019,Immune cell neural interactions and their contributions to sickle cell disease.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolysis, inflammation, and pain. Mechanisms of pain manifestation are complex, and there is a major gap in knowledge of how the nervous and immune systems interact to contribute to pain and other comorbidities in SCD. Sterile inflammation in the periphery and central nervous system contributes to vascular and neural activation. Cellular and soluble mediators create an inflammatory and neuroinflammatory microenvironment contributing to neurogenic inflammation and acute and chronic pain. In this review we highlight relevant neuro-immune interactions that contribute to the pathobiology of SCD.","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cells;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Hemolysis;Humans;Immune System;Inflammation;Knowledge;Mast Cells;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neuroimmunomodulation;Pain;Review;Serpins","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hemolysis;Inflammation;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain",Neurosci Lett,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
30859050,2019,Associations between Orofacial Clefting and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.,"Orofacial clefting (OFC) is the most common developmental craniofacial malformation, and causal etiologies largely remain unknown. The opioid crisis has led to a large proportion of infants recovering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to in-utero narcotics exposure. We sought to characterize the prevalence of OFC in infants with NAS. This cohort study analyzed live births at our institution from 2013 to 2017 to identify any association between OFC and NAS. Prevalence of OFC was 6.79 and 1.63 (per 1,000 live births) in the NAS and general population, respectively. Odds ratios for NAS patients having developed OFC, isolated cleft palate, isolated cleft lip, and combined cleft lip and palate compared with the general population were found to be 4.18 (P = 0.001), 5.92 (P = 0.001), 3.79 (P = 0.05), and 2.94 (P = 0.35), respectively. Analyses performed comparing the NAS and general populations to control for potential confounding variables influencing the NAS population yielded no significant differences with exception of in-utero exposure to physician prescribed opioids. Prevalence of OFC in infants with NAS was higher than the general live birth population. Isolated cleft palate and isolated cleft lip, specifically, were significantly more prevalent in NAS patients compared with the general population and were associated with in-utero opioid exposure.","Association;Cleft Lip;Cleft Palate;Cleft Palate, Isolated;Cohort Studies;Confounding Variables;Infant;Live Birth;Narcotics;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Odds Ratio;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Palate;Patients;Physicians;Population;Prevalence","Cleft Lip;Cleft Palate;Cleft Palate, Isolated;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

30890918,2019,"Transcriptome Analysis of the Human Tibial Nerve Identifies Sexually Dimorphic Expression of Genes Involved in Pain, Inflammation, and Neuro-Immunity.","Sex differences in gene expression are important contributors to normal physiology and mechanisms of disease. This is increasingly apparent in understanding and potentially treating chronic pain where molecular mechanisms driving sex differences in neuronal plasticity are giving new insight into why certain chronic pain disorders preferentially affect women vs. men. Large transcriptomic resources are now available and can be used to mine for sex differences to gather insight from molecular profiles using donor cohorts. We performed in-depth analysis of 248 human tibial nerve (hTN) transcriptomes from the GTEx Consortium project to gain insight into sex-dependent gene expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). We discover 149 genes with sex differential gene expression. Many of the more abundant genes in men are associated with inflammation and appear to be primarily expressed by glia or immune cells, with some genes downstream of Notch signaling. In women, we find the differentially expressed transcription factor SP4 that is known to drive a regulatory program, and may impact sex differences in PNS physiology. Many of these 149 differentially expressed (DE) genes have some previous association with chronic pain but few of them have been explored thoroughly. Additionally, using clinical data in the GTEx database, we identify a subset of DE, sexually dimorphic genes in diseases associated with chronic pain: arthritis and Type II diabetes.

30944099,2019,Morphine promotes neovascularizing retinopathy in sickle transgeneic mice.,"Neovascularizing retinopathy is a significant complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), occurring more frequently in HbSC than HbSS disease. This risk difference is concordant with a divergence of angiogenesis risk, as identified by levels of pro- vs anti-angiogenic factors in the sickle patient's blood. Because our prior studies documented that morphine promotes angiogenesis in both malignancy and wound healing, we tested whether chronic opioid treatment would promote retinopathy in NY1DD sickle transgenic mice. After 10 to 15 months of treatment, sickle mice treated with morphine developed neovascularizing retinopathy to a far greater extent than either of the controls (sickle mice treated with saline and wild-type mice treated identically with morphine). Our dissection of the mechanistic linkage between morphine and retinopathy revealed a complex interplay among morphine engagement with its μ opioid receptor (MOR) on retinal endothelial cells (RECs); morphine-induced production of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 (IL-6), causing increased expression of both MOR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on RECs; morphine/MOR engagement transactivating VEGFR2; and convergence of MOR, VEGFR2, and IL-6 activation on JAK/STAT3-dependent REC proliferation and angiogenesis. In the NY1DD mice, the result was increased angiogenesis, seen as neovascularizing retinopathy, similar to the retinal pathology occurring in humans with SCD. Therefore, we conclude that chronic opioid exposure, superimposed on the already angiogenic sickle milieu, might enhance risk for retinopathy. These results provide an additional reason for development and application of opioid alternatives for pain control in SCD.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Angiogenesis Factor;Animals;Blood;Cancer;Disease;Dissection;Endothelial Cells;Humans;Interleukin-6;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Morphine;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Opioids;Pain;Pathology;Patients;Production;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Retina;Retinaldehyde;Risk;Therapeutics;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2;Wound Healing","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cancer;Necrosis;Neoplasms;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Pain;Wounds",Blood Adv,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the absence of hip precautions improved early recovery after total hip arthroplasty via the posterolateral approach. Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty via the posterolateral approach at 3 centers were enrolled. Patients meeting the selection criteria were randomized to standard hip precautions (SHP) or no hip precautions (NHP) for 6 weeks following surgery. HOOS Jr, Health State visual analog score, and rate of pain scores were recorded preoperatively and in subsequent postoperative visits; dislocation episodes were also noted. Standard statistical analysis was performed. From 2016 to 2017, 159 patients were randomized to SHP and 154 patients were randomized to NHP. Controlling for the center at which the surgery was performed, the only difference in outcome scores between the 2 groups was at 2 weeks; the NHP group had a lower HOOS Jr score when compared to the SHP group (P = .03). There was no difference in outcome scores at any other time points when compared to preoperative assessments. In the SHP group, there were 2 recorded dislocations (1.3%) and 1 in the NHP group (0.7%; P = .62). In this multicenter, randomized, controlled study, the absence of hip precautions in the postoperative period did not improve subjective outcomes which may be explained by the self-limiting behavior of NHP patients. Furthermore, with the numbers available for the study, there was no difference in the rate of dislocation between the 2 groups.","Aged;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip;Behavior;Female;General Surgery;Health;Hip;Hip Dislocation;Hip Replacement, Total;Humans;Infection Control;Joint Dislocations;Male;Middle Aged;Pain;Pain Measurement;Patient Selection;Patients;Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;Research Design;Selection Criteria;Self;Standards;Time;Treatment Outcome;Visual Analog Scale",Hip Dislocation;Infections;Joint Dislocations;Pain;Postoperative Complications,J Arthroplasty,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

31141817,2019,Role of RGS12 in the differential regulation of kappa opioid receptor-dependent signaling and behavior.,"Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists show promise in ameliorating disorders, such as addiction and chronic pain, but are limited by dysphoric and aversive side effects. Clinically beneficial effects of KOR agonists (e.g., analgesia) are predominantly mediated by heterotrimeric G protein signaling, whereas β-arrestin signaling is considered central to their detrimental side effects (e.g., dysphoria/aversion). Here we show that Regulator of G protein Signaling-12 (RGS12), via independent signaling mechanisms, simultaneously attenuates G protein signaling and augments β-arrestin signaling downstream of KOR, exhibiting considerable selectivity in its actions for KOR over other opioid receptors. We previously reported that RGS12-null mice exhibit increased dopamine transporter-mediated dopamine (DA) uptake in the ventral (vSTR), but not dorsal striatum (dSTR), as well as reduced psychostimulant-induced hyperlocomotion; in the current study, we found that these phenotypes are reversed following KOR antagonism. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry studies of dopamine (DA) release and reuptake suggest that striatal disruptions to KOR-dependent DAergic neurotransmission in RGS12-null mice are restricted to the nucleus accumbens. In both ventral striatal tissue and transfected cells, RGS12 and KOR are seen to interact within a protein complex. Ventral striatal-specific increases in KOR levels and KOR-induced G protein activation are seen in RGS12-null mice, as well as enhanced sensitivity to KOR agonist-induced hypolocomotion and analgesia-G protein signaling-dependent behaviors; a ventral striatal-specific increase in KOR levels was also observed in β-arrestin-2-deficient mice, highlighting the importance of β-arrestin signaling to establishing steady-state KOR levels in this particular brain region. Conversely, RGS12-null mice exhibited attenuated KOR-induced conditioned place aversion (considered a β-arrestin signaling-dependent behavior), consistent with the augmented KOR-mediated β-arrestin signaling seen upon RGS12 over-expression. Collectively, our findings highlight a role for RGS12 as a novel, differential regulator of both G protein-dependent and -independent signaling downstream of KOR activation.","3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-(-)-Isomer;Analgesia;Animals;Avoidance Learning;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Brain;Cells;Chronic Pain;Dopamine;Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Enkephalin, Leucine-2-Alanine;Exhibition;Female;GTP-Binding Proteins;Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Locomotion;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Nucleus Accumbens;Phenotype;Proteins;RGS Proteins;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Regulation;Role;Sensitivity;Signal Transduction;Synaptic Transmission;Tissues;Ventral Striatum;beta-Arrestin 2;beta-Arrestins",Chronic Pain,Neuropsychopharmacology,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

The aim of this study was to determine if states with high opioid-induced deaths and overall drug-induced deaths were more likely to have continuing education (CE) requirements related to opioid use/pain management than states with fewer opioid-induced deaths. Almost 200 state dental and medical law boards' websites were examined for CE requirements, license renewal periods, and CE requirements for opioid use/pain management in December 2018 and January 2019. Drug-induced death data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention online database. States were categorized into quartiles of opioid-induced deaths per 100,000 population. A similar categorization was created for all drug-induced deaths. The results showed that states in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of opioid-induced deaths were more likely to have dental boards requiring opioid use/pain management CE than states in the first quartile in dentistry. This pattern was not the case with the medical boards' requirements. Dentists and physicians in states with higher all drug-induced deaths per 100,000 population were as likely to be required to attend opioid use/pain management CE as dentists and physicians in states with lower opioid-induced deaths.

31200005,2019,Association of osteoarthritis and pain with Alzheimer's Diseases and Related Dementias among older adults in the United States.,"Emerging evidence suggests that Pain Interference (PI) and certain chronic pain conditions, including Osteoarthritis (OA) may be associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). However, research exploring the relation of OA and PI to ADRD remains sparse. To assess the association of OA and PI to ADRD using cross-sectional data from a representative sample of USA adults aged ≥65 years. Retrospective cross-sectional. Older adults (age ≥ 65 years) drawn from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS, 2009-2015). OA was identified using both medical conditions files and participant responses to arthritis-specific queries. ADRD was ascertained using the medical conditions files. PI was defined as reported frequent PI with normal activities (PIA). OA and PIA were categorized as a composite variable: 1) OA with PIA; 2) OA without PIA; 3) No OA with PIA; and 4) No OA and no PIA (reference group). Adjusted associations of OA and PIA to ADRD were assessed using logistic regression and adjusted for biological, demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and health conditions. Overall, 27.1% had OA, of whom 47.6 % reported PIA vs 31.1% of those without OA; 2.8% had diagnosed ADRD.

31221884,2019,Use of prescription opioids among patients with rheumatic diseases compared to patients with hypertension in the USA: a retrospective cohort study.,"Long-term opioid prescribing has increased amid concerns over effectiveness and safety of its use. We examined long-term prescription opioid use among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), compared with patients with hypertension (HTN). We used Truven MarketScan, a US commercial claims database (2003-2014) and identified RA, SLE, PsA and AS cohorts, each matched by age and sex to patients with HTN. We compared long-term opioid prescription use during 1 year of follow-up and used multivariable Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risk (RR) of receiving opioid prescriptions based on underlying disease cohort. We identified 181 710 RA (mean age 55.3±13.1, 77% female), 45 834 SLE (47.1±13.1, 91% female), 30 307 PsA (49.7±11.5, 51% female), 7686 AS (44.6±12.0, 39% female) and parallel numbers of age-matched and sex-matched patients with HTN. The proportion of patients receiving long-term opioid prescriptions, and other measures of opioid prescriptions were higher among rheumatic disease cohorts and highest in patients with AS. AS was associated with the highest RR of receiving long-term opioid prescriptions (RR 2.73, 95% CI 2.60 to 2.87) versus HTN, while RRs were 2.21 (2.16 to 2.25) for RA, 1.94 (1.87 to 2.00) for PsA and 1.82 (1.77 to 1.88) for SLE. Patients with rheumatic disease have higher rates of long-term opioid prescriptions, and patients with AS have the highest risk of receiving opioid prescriptions versus patients with HTN. Further studies investigating the effectiveness of disease-targeted treatments on decreasing opioid use in these four rheumatic diseases may provide strategies for reducing prescription opioids.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Arthritis, Psoriatic;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Cohort Studies;Database;Disease;Drug Prescriptions;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Hypertension;Incidence;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prescriptions;Prognosis;Relative Risk;Retrospective Studies;Rheumatic Diseases;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Sex;Spondylitis, Ankylosing;Therapeutics;Time Factors;United States","Arthritis, Psoriatic;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Hypertension;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Rheumatic Diseases;Spondylitis, Ankylosing",BMJ Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31249631,2019,Whole exome sequencing of patients who resolved Crohn's disease and complex regional pain syndrome following treatment for paratuberculosis.,"A whole exome sequencing study was performed on an extended family including a patient with Crohn's disease (CD) and a patient with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The patient with CD and the patient with CRPS have experienced resolution of their disease following treatment for paratuberculosis. The study was performed in order to determine if there is an unusual mutation in this extended family that would explain the susceptibility to mycobacterial infection among many of the members. We identified sets of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were shared among affected family members, including variants in two genes, IL15RA and CASP10, which have established roles in the immune response. In addition, the CD and CRPS patients were found to have heterozygous mutations in MBL2 and DDX58, mutations that have been associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis. The IL15RA and CASP10 variants may contribute to the disease symptoms exhibited in this family. The finding of SNPs associated with immune function supports a complementary role of infection and genetics in these diseases.","Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Crohn Disease;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene;Disease;Extended Family;Family;Family Members;Genes;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetics;Immunity;Infections;Interleukin-15;Mutation;Mycobacterium avium;Paratuberculosis;Patients;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Role;Therapeutics;Tuberculosis;Whole Exome Sequencing","Complex Regional Pain Syndromes;Crohn Disease;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Infections;Paratuberculosis;Tuberculosis",Gut Pathog,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31253755,2019,Differences between Dorsal Root and Trigeminal Ganglion Nociceptors in Mice Revealed by Translational Profiling.,"Nociceptors located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and DRG are the primary sensors of damaging or potentially damaging stimuli for the head and body, respectively, and are key drivers of chronic pain states. While nociceptors in these two tissues show a high degree of functional similarity, there are important differences in their development lineages, their functional connections to the CNS, and recent genome-wide analyses of gene expression suggest that they possess some unique genomic signatures. Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification to comprehensively characterize and compare mRNA translation in Scn10a-positive nociceptors in the TG and DRG of male and female mice. This unbiased method independently confirms several findings of differences between TG and DRG nociceptors described in the literature but also suggests preferential utilization of key signaling pathways. Most prominently, we provide evidence that translational efficiency in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related genes is higher in the TG compared with DRG, whereas several genes associated with the negative regulator of mTOR, AMP-activated protein kinase, have higher translational efficiency in DRG nociceptors. Using capsaicin as a sensitizing stimulus, we show that behavioral responses are greater in the TG region and this effect is completely reversible with mTOR inhibition. These findings have implications for the relative capacity of these nociceptors to be sensitized upon injury. Together, our data provide a comprehensive, comparative view of transcriptome and translatome activity in TG and DRG nociceptors that enhances our understanding of nociceptor biology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The DRG and trigeminal ganglion (TG) provide sensory information from the body and head, respectively. Nociceptors in these tissues are critical first neurons in the pain pathway. Injury to peripheral neurons in these tissues can cause chronic pain. Interestingly, clinical and preclinical findings support the conclusion that injury to TG neurons is more likely to cause chronic pain and chronic pain in the TG area is more intense and more difficult to treat. We used translating ribosome affinity purification technology to gain new insight into potential differences in the translatomes of DRG and TG neurons. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized differences between TG and DRG nociceptors that provide new insight into how injury may differentially drive plasticity states in nociceptors in these two tissues.","AMP-Activated Protein Kinases;Animals;Biology;Capsaicin;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Dorsal Roots;Drive;Efficiency;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Head;Injuries;Literature;Male;Methods;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;News;Nociceptors;Pain;Protein Biosynthesis;Relatives;Ribosomes;Signal Transduction;Sirolimus;Technology;Tissues;Transcriptome;Translating;Trigeminal Ganglion",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31342518,2020,Maternal hair cortisol levels as a novel predictor of neonatal abstinence syndrome severity: A pilot feasibility study.,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) after in-utero opioid exposure remains a poorly understood condition with multiple factors contributing to severity. Exposure to maternal stress may be one contributing factor. Hair cortisol measurement represents a novel technique for assessing prenatal stress. In this pilot study, the association between maternal hair cortisol levels and NAS severity was examined in 70 postpartum women with opioid use disorder within 72 hr of delivery. Infants were monitored for NAS and treated according to institutional protocol. Forty-four (63%) of the infants were pharmacologically treated for NAS, with a mean length of hospital stay (LOS) for all infants of 14.2 (SD 9.0) days. The mean cortisol level in the mothers was 131.8 pg/mg (SD 124.7). In bivariate analysis, higher maternal hair cortisol levels were associated with shorter infant LOS (R = -.26, p = .03) and fewer infant opioid treatment days (R = -.28, p = .02). Results were no longer statistically significant in regression models after adjusting for maternal opioid and smoking. In conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility of hair cortisol assaying within the first few days after delivery in mothers with opioid use disorder as a novel marker for NAS. The findings suggest that maternal stress may impact the severity of infant opioid withdrawal.","Adult;Association;Feasibility Studies;Female;Hair;Hospital Stay;Humans;Hydrocortisone;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Mothers;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Severity of Illness Index;Smoking;Stress, Psychological;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Dev Psychobiol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31384558,2019,Salmonella neck abscess in a diabetic.,"Salmonella is known to cause invasive illness. However, head and neck abscesses are an unusual presentation of extra-intestinal infection with this organism. We describe a case of Salmonella neck abscess in a diabetic patient. An 18 year old diabetic male was admitted with increasing left sided neck pain and swelling approximately four weeks after gastrointestinal illness. Imaging revealed a left sided neck abscess. Surgical drainage was undertaken. Cultures grew non-typhoid Salmonella species. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and did well clinically. Salmonella infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with immunocompromising conditions presenting with neck abscess of unclear etiology.","Abscess;Antibiotics;Culture;Diagnosis, Differential;Drainage;Head;Infections;Male;Neck;Neck Pain;Patients;Salmonella;Salmonella Infections;Typhoid Fever",Abscess;Infections;Neck Pain;Salmonella Infections;Typhoid Fever,IDCases,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31405719,2019,Identifying high-risk areas for nonfatal opioid overdose: a spatial case-control study using EMS run data.,"The objective of our study was to incorporate stricter probable nonfatal opioid overdose case criteria, and advanced epidemiologic approaches to more reliably detect local clustering in nonfatal opioid overdose activity in EMS runs data. Data were obtained using emsCharts for our study area in southwestern Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2018. Cases were identified as emergency medical service (EMS) responses where naloxone was administered, and improvement was noted in patient records between initial and final Glasgow Coma Score. A subsample of all-cause EMS responses sites were used as controls and exact matched to cases on sex and 10-year-age category. Clustering was assessed using difference in Ripley's K function for cases and controls and Kulldorff scan statistics. Difference in K functions indicated no significant difference in probable nonfatal overdose EMS runs across the study area compared to all-cause EMS runs. However, scan statistics did identify significant local clustering of probable nonfatal overdose EMS runs (maximum likelihood = 16.40, P = 0.0003). Results highlight relevance of EMS data to detect community-level overdose activity and promote reliable use through stricter case definition criteria and advanced methodological approaches. Techniques examined have the potential to improve targeted delivery of neighborhood-level public health response activities using a near real-time data source.","Analgesics, Opioid;Case-Control Studies;Chart;Cluster Analysis;Coma;Community;Data Sources;Drug Overdose;Emergency Medical Services;Geographic Information Systems;Humans;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Neighborhood;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pennsylvania;Public Health;Records;Risk;Sex;Spatial Analysis;Statistics;Time",Coma;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Ann Epidemiol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31428515,2019,DNA released from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) activates pancreatic stellate cells and enhances pancreatic tumor growth.,"Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation results in the expulsion of granulocyte proteins and DNA into the extracellular space. This process is mediated by the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) and translocation of elastase to the nucleus. NET formation, marked by increased levels of extracellular DNA, promotes pancreatic cancer proliferation and metastasis. Mice deficient in Padi4 demonstrate decreased pancreatic tumor growth, associated with a reduction in circulating extracellular DNA levels, diminished pancreatic stromal activation and improved survival in murine orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Transplantation of Padi4-/- bone marrow into genetically engineered mice with Kras driven pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Pdx1-Cre:KrasG12D/+, KC mice) limits the frequency of invasive cancers when compared with syngeneic controls. DNA from neutrophils activates pancreatic stellate cells that form dense, fibrous stroma which can promote and enable tumor proliferation. DNase treatment diminishes murine tumor growth and stromal activation to reverse the effect of NETs within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, deletion of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in pancreatic stellate cells abrogates the effects of DNA in promoting stellate cell proliferation and decreases tumor growth. Circulating neutrophil-derived DNA correlates with the stage in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, confirming the role of NETs in human pancreatic cancer. These findings support further investigation into targeting of NETs, PADI4 and extracellular DNA as a potential treatment strategy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

31433685,2019,"The association of pain interference and opioid use with healthcare utilization and costs, and wage loss among adults with osteoarthritis in the United States.","Aim: To examine associations of opioid use and pain interference with activities (PIA), healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs, and wage loss in noninstitutionalized adults with osteoarthritis in the United States (US). Methods: Adults with osteoarthritis identified from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2011/2013/2015 were stratified by no-opioid use with no/mild PIA, no-opioid use with moderate/severe PIA, opioid use with no/mild PIA, and opioid use with moderate/severe PIA. Outcomes included annualized total HRU, direct healthcare costs, and wage loss. Multivariable regression analyses were used for comparisons versus no-opioid use with no/mild PIA (referent). The counterfactual recycled prediction method estimated incremental costs. Results reflect weighted nationally representative data. Results: Of 4,921 participants (weighted n = 20,785,007), 46.5% had no-opioid use with no/mild PIA; 23.2% had no-opioid use with moderate/severe PIA; 9.6% had opioid use with no/mild PIA; and 20.7% had opioid use with moderate/severe PIA. Moderate/severe PIA and/or opioid use were associated with significantly higher HRU and associated costs, and wage loss. Relative to adults with no/mild PIA, opioid users with moderate/severe PIA were more likely to have hospitalizations, specialist visits, and emergency room visits (all p &lt; .001). Relative to the referent, opioid use with no/mild PIA had higher per-patient incremental annual total healthcare costs ($11,672, 95% confidence interval [CI] = $11,435-$11,909) and wage loss ($1,395, 95% CI = $1,376-$1,414) as did opioid use with moderate/severe PIA ($13,595, 95% CI = $13,319-$13,871; and $2,331, 95% CI = $2,298-$2,363) (all p &lt; .001). Compared with the referent, estimated excess national total healthcare costs/lost wages were $23.3 billion/$1.3 billion for opioid use with no/mild PIA, and $58.5 billion/$2.2 billion for opioid use with moderate/severe PIA. Limitations: Unobservable/unmeasured factors that could not be accounted for. Conclusions: Opioid use with moderate/severe PIA had significantly higher HRU, costs, and wage loss; opioid use was more relevant than PIA to the economic burden. These results suggest unmet needs for alternative pain management strategies.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Confidence Intervals;Cost;Cost of Illness;Cross-Sectional Studies;Economics;Economics, Medical;Emergency Service, Hospital;Expenditures;Female;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Health Expenditures;Health Resources;Hospitalization;Humans;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Needs;Opioids;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Regression Analysis;Relatives;Resources;Retrospective Studies;Salaries and Fringe Benefits;Severity of Illness Index;Specialists;Surveys;United States;Wages;Young Adult",Osteoarthritis;Pain,J Med Econ,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31492823,2019,Preclinical Testing of Nalfurafine as an Opioid-sparing Adjuvant that Potentiates Analgesia by the Mu Opioid Receptor-targeting Agonist Morphine.,"Mu opioid receptor (MOR)-targeting analgesics are efficacious pain treatments, but notorious for their abuse potential. In preclinical animal models, coadministration of traditional kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-targeting agonists with MOR-targeting analgesics can decrease reward and potentiate analgesia. However, traditional KOR-targeting agonists are well known for inducing antitherapeutic side effects (psychotomimesis, depression, anxiety, dysphoria). Recent data suggest that some functionally selective, or biased, KOR-targeting agonists might retain the therapeutic effects of KOR activation without inducing undesirable side effects. Nalfurafine, used safely in Japan since 2009 for uremic pruritus, is one such functionally selective KOR-targeting agonist. Here, we quantify the bias of nalfurafine and several other KOR agonists relative to an unbiased reference standard (U50,488) and show that nalfurafine and EOM-salvinorin-B demonstrate marked G protein-signaling bias. While nalfurafine (0.015 mg/kg) and EOM-salvinorin-B (1 mg/kg) produced spinal antinociception equivalent to 5 mg/kg U50,488, only nalfurafine significantly enhanced the supraspinal analgesic effect of 5 mg/kg morphine. In addition, 0.015 mg/kg nalfurafine did not produce significant conditioned place aversion, yet retained the ability to reduce morphine-induced conditioned place preference in C57BL/6J mice. Nalfurafine and EOM-salvinorin-B each produced robust inhibition of both spontaneous and morphine-stimulated locomotor behavior, suggesting a persistence of sedative effects when coadministered with morphine. Taken together, these findings suggest that nalfurafine produces analgesic augmentation, while also reducing opioid-induced reward with less risk of dysphoria. Thus, adjuvant administration of G protein-biased KOR agonists like nalfurafine may be beneficial in enhancing the therapeutic potential of MOR-targeting analgesics, such as morphine.","Ability;Administration;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Anxiety;Behavior;Bias;Depression;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Drug Synergism;Female;GTP-Binding Proteins;Japan;Locomotion;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Models, Animal;Morphinans;Morphine;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pruritus;Random Allocation;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Reference Standards;Relatives;Reward;Risk;Sedative Effect;Spiro Compounds;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics",Pain;Pruritus,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31624329,2019,Endoplasmic reticulum stress differentially modulates the IL-6 family of cytokines in murine astrocytes and macrophages.,"In many diseases, misfolded proteins accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to ER stress. In response, the cell initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to reestablish homeostasis. Additionally, in response to ER stress, various cell types mount an inflammatory response involving interleukin (IL)-6. While IL-6 has been widely studied, the impact of ER stress on other members of the IL-6 cytokine family, including oncostatin (OSM), IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) remains to be elucidated. Here, we have examined the expression of the IL-6 family cytokines in response to pharmacologically-induced ER stress in astrocytes and macrophages, which express IL-6 in response to ER stress through different mechanisms. Our findings indicate that, in astrocytes, ER stress regulates mRNA expression of the IL-6 family of cytokines that is, in part, mediated by PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Additionally, in astrocytes, CNTF expression was suppressed through a PERK-dependent mechanism. Macrophages display a different profile of expression of the IL-6 family that is largely independent of PERK. However, IL-6 expression in macrophages was dependent on JAK signaling. Overall, this study demonstrates the cell-specific and differential mechanisms controlling expression of the IL-6 family of cytokines in response to ER stress.","Animals;Astrocytes;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor;Cytokines;Disease;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Family;Homeostasis;Interleukin-11;Interleukin-6;Interleukins;Janus Kinase 1;Janus Kinases;Leukemia;Macrophages;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Overall;Phosphotransferases;Primary Cell Culture;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Signal Transduction;Thapsigargin;Tunicamycin;Unfolded Protein Response;eIF-2 Kinase",Leukemia,Sci Rep,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31647279,2020,A case report illustrating the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cue-induced craving in an individual with opioid and cocaine use disorder.,"Nationally, it was estimated that 11.4 million people misused opioids in 2017 with more than 47,000 opioid-related deaths. Although medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has been effective in enhancing treatment retention and decreasing frequency of opioid use, relapse rates for opioids and other substances remain high, emphasizing the importance of investigating novel interventions to augment MAT. One potential treatment approach is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)-a noninvasive, electrophysiological method of neuromodulation. Recently published studies of rTMS in individuals with alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine use disorder have suggested that this treatment shows promise in reducing cravings and substance use. The literature specific to rTMS and opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited to a single published study in heroin users, which showed that a single session of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduced cue-induced craving, with a further reduction following 5 consecutive days of rTMS. The following case report involved a 25-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with OUD and cocaine use disorder. This subject continued to demonstrate ongoing substance use despite participating in comprehensive MAT with buprenorphine/naloxone in combination with psychosocial interventions. He was administered 7 separate sessions of rTMS targeting the left DLPFC. Substance-related cues were presented prior to, during, and following these rTMS administration sessions and the subject rated his substance cravings via a 100-point Visual Analog Scale. When compared with his cue-induced craving ratings, there was a mean reduction in craving for heroin and cocaine by ∼60% to 82% following the 7 administration sessions. Although this is a single case, further investigation of rTMS as an augmentation strategy for OUD and polysubstance use is warranted.

31663968,2021,The Impact of Complications and Pain on Patient Satisfaction.,"To measure the association between patient-reported satisfaction and regret and clinical outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes are becoming an increasingly important marker of the quality of patient care. It is unclear however, how well patient-reported outcomes adequately reflect care quality and clinical outcomes in surgical patients. Retrospective, population-based analysis of adults ages 18 and older undergoing surgery across 38 hospitals in Michigan between January 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018. In this study, 9953 patients (mean age 56 years; 5634 women (57%)) underwent 1 of 16 procedures. 9550 (96%) patients experienced no complication, whereas 240 (2%) and 163 (2%) patients experienced Grade 1 and Grade 2-3 complications, respectively. Postoperative pain scores were: none (908 (9%) patients), mild (3863 (40%) patients), moderate (3893 (40%) patients), and severe (1075 (11%) patients). Overall, 7881 (79%) patients were highly satisfied and 8911 (91%) had absolutely no regret after surgery. Patients were less likely to be highly satisfied if they experienced a Grade 1 complication [odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.66], Grade 2-3 complication (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31-0.62), minimal pain (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99, moderate pain (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.32-0.49), or severe pain (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.29). Patients were less likely to have no regret if they experienced a Grade 1 complication (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.70), Grade 2-3 complication (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.60), moderate pain (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.76), or severe pain (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.16-0.31). The predicted probability of being highly satisfied was 79% for patients who had no complications and 88% for patients who had no pain. Patients who experienced postoperative complications and pain were less likely to be highly satisfied or have no regret. Notably, postoperative pain had a more significant effect on satisfaction and regret after surgery, suggesting focused postsurgical pain management is an opportunity to substantially improve patient experiences. More research and patient education are needed for managing expectations of postoperative pain, and use of adjuncts and regional anesthesia.","Adult;Aged;Anesthesia, Conduction;Association;Confidence Intervals;Emotions;Expectations;Female;General Surgery;Hospitals;Humans;Male;Measures;Michigan;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Overall;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Care;Patient Education as Topic;Patient Reported Outcome Measures;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Population;Postoperative Complications;Probability;Procedures;Quality of Health Care;Regret;Research;Retrospective Studies;Satisfaction;Women","Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Complications",Ann Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31683186,2020,Concurrent Alcohol and Opioid Use Among Harm Reduction Clients.,"Harm reduction services infrequently address alcohol use among clients using opioids, despite the evaluated risk of overdose or medical consequences for clients with viral infections. The purpose of this study is to assess concurrent alcohol and opioid use among syringe services and overdose prevention program participants predominately in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky. This is a cross-sectional study using self-report data (n = 1,142) pooled across regional overdose prevention programs and a mobile syringe services program. The outcome variable was concurrent use categorized as no concurrent alcohol, prescription opioid or heroin use; alcohol and heroin or prescription opioid use; and alcohol, prescription opioid and heroin use in the past three months. The sample was predominantly white (95%), 56% were male and the mean age was 33 years old. Forty-seven percent of the clients had no concurrent use of alcohol and opioids; 20.1% reported concurrent use of alcohol and either heroin or prescription opioids; and 33.4% reported concurrent use of alcohol, heroin and prescription opioids in the past 3 months. Lifetime suicidal ideation and non-opioid drug use were associated with concurrent alcohol and opioid use in the multivariable model.

31820218,2020,Association of Opioid Overdose Risk Factors and Naloxone Prescribing in US Adults.,"Prescribing naloxone to patients is a key strategy to prevent opioid overdoses, but little is known about the reach of naloxone prescribing. Determine patient factors associated with receiving naloxone and trends over time in patients with key overdose risk factors. Retrospective observational study. Using the Clinformatics DataMart, a US-wide health insurance claims dataset, we compared adults who received opioids and naloxone (opioid+naloxone) from January 2014 to June 2017 with adults who received opioids without naloxone (opioids only), matched on gender, age ± 5 years, month/year of opioid fill, and number of opioid claims. Key patient-level opioid overdose risk factors included receipt of high-dosage opioids, concurrent benzodiazepines, history of opioid and other substance use disorders, and history of opioid overdose. We included 3963 opioid+naloxone and 19,815 opioid only patients. Key factors associated with naloxone fills included high opioid daily dosage (50 to &lt; 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME): AOR = 2.43, 95% CI 2.15-2.76 and ≥ 90 MME: AOR = 3.94, 95% CI 3.47-4.46; reference: &lt; 50 MME), receiving concurrent benzodiazepines (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.16-1.38), and having a diagnosis of opioid use disorder (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.40-1.73). History of opioid overdose was not associated with naloxone (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.74-1.15). The percent of patients receiving naloxone increased, yet less than 2% of patients in any of the key overdose risk factor groups received naloxone by the last 6 months of the study period. Naloxone prescribing has increased and was more likely to be co-prescribed to patients with some risk factors for overdose. However, overall prescribing remains minimal.

Given this multidisciplinary ontology, prior attempts have been made to establish a framework for understanding the role of biological, psychological, and socio-environmental constructs in disease development, maintenance, and treatment. Other models, however, do not explain how factors may interact and develop over time. The aim here was to apply and adapt the 3P model, originally developed and used in the treatment of insomnia, to couch the biopsychosocial model in a way that explains how diseases develop, are maintained, and can be treated. This paper outlines the role of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors in disease states and conditions (the 3Ps) and provides examples of how this model may be adapted and applied to a number of health-related diseases or disorders including chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, oral disease, and heart disease. The 3P framework can aid in facilitating a multidisciplinary, theoretical approach and way of conceptualizing the study and treatment of diseases in the future.","Behavioral Medicine;Biopharmaceuticals;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Dentistry;Disease;Future;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Health;Health Psychology;Heart Diseases;Maintenance;Models, Biopsychosocial;Outline;Pain;Paper;Physiology;Policy Makers;Psychologic Processes;Psychology;Public Health;Research Personnel;Role;Sleeplessness;Therapeutics;Time",Chronic Pain;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Heart Diseases;Pain;Sleeplessness,Front Psychol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31831729,2019,TRPV1 activity and substance P release are required for corneal cold nociception.,"As a protective mechanism, the cornea is sensitive to noxious stimuli. Here, we show that in mice, a high proportion of corneal TRPM8+ cold-sensing fibers express the heat-sensitive TRPV1 channel. Despite its insensitivity to cold, TRPV1 enhances membrane potential changes and electrical firing of TRPM8+ neurons in response to cold stimulation. This elevated neuronal excitability leads to augmented ocular cold nociception in mice. In a model of dry eye disease, the expression of TRPV1 in TRPM8+ cold-sensing fibers is increased, and results in severe cold allodynia. Overexpression of TRPV1 in TRPM8+ sensory neurons leads to cold allodynia in both corneal and non-corneal tissues without affecting their thermal sensitivity. TRPV1-dependent neuronal sensitization facilitates the release of the neuropeptide substance P from TRPM8+ cold-sensing neurons to signal nociception in response to cold. Our study identifies a mechanism underlying corneal cold nociception and suggests a potential target for the treatment of ocular pain.","Allodynia;Animals;Cold Temperature;Cornea;Dry Eye Syndromes;Gene Expression Regulation;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Lead;Male;Membrane Potentials;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Nociception;Pain;Sensitivity;Sensory Receptor Cells;Substance P;TRPV Cation Channels;Tamoxifen;Therapeutics;Thermosensing;Tissues",Allodynia;Dry Eye Syndromes;Hyperalgesia;Pain,Nat Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31850745,2020,Structure-Based Design of Novel Biphenyl Amide Antagonists of Human Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 8 Channels with Potential Implications in the Treatment of Sensory Neuropathies.,"Structure-activity relationship studies of a reported menthol-based transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 channel (TRPM8) antagonist, guided by computational simulations and structure-based design, uncovers a novel series of TRPM8 antagonists with &gt;10-fold selectivity versus related TRP subtypes. Spiro[4.5]decan-8-yl analogue 14 inhibits icilin-evoked Ca2+ entry in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human TRPM8 (hTRPM8) with an IC50 of 2.4 ± 1.0 nM, while in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings this analogue inhibits menthol-evoked currents with a hTRPM8 IC50 of 64 ± 2 nM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of compound 14 in our homology model of hTRPM8 suggest that this antagonist forms extensive hydrophobic contacts within the orthosteric site. In the wet dog shakes (WDS) assay, compound 14 dose-dependently blocks icilin-triggered shaking behaviors in mice. Upon local administration, compound 14 dose dependently inhibits cold allodynia evoked by the chemotherapy oxaliplatin in a murine model of peripheral neuropathy at microgram doses. Our findings suggest that 14 and other biphenyl amide analogues within our series can find utility as potent antagonist chemical probes derived from (-)-menthol as well as small molecule therapeutic scaffolds for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and other sensory neuropathies.",Administration;Allodynia;Amides;Behavior;Biphenyl Compounds;Calcium;Cells;Cold Temperature;Dogs;Drug Therapy;Form;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Inhibitory Concentration 50;Menthol;Mice;Molecular Dynamics;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Oxaliplatin;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Structure-Activity Relationship;TRPM Cation Channels;Therapeutics;Transient Receptor Potential Channels,Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,ACS Chem Neurosci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31875300,2020,A Longitudinal Study of the Association of Opioid Use with Change in Pain Interference and Functional Limitations in a Nationally Representative Cohort of Adults with Osteoarthritis in the United States.,"Real-world data are sparse on longitudinal associations of opioid use with pain interference with activities (PIA) and daily function with osteoarthritis (OA) in the USA. Data from the 2010-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were analyzed for community-dwelling adults with OA. Opioid use patterns were defined as persistent, intermittent, and no use. Evaluated outcomes were a change in PIA and functional limitations (activities of daily living [ADL], instrumental ADL [IADL], social and work activities, and cognitive function). Multivariable regression analyses explored the association of persistent/intermittent versus no opioid use with PIA and functional limitations. Results were weighted for the US population. Among 4172 patients (66.2% female, 80.8% white, mean age 61.7 years), 62.1% reported no PIA change at follow-up, 17.9% worsened, and 20.0% improved. Although 51.0-93.1% of patients reported no functional limitations, 3.8-13.1% worsened (1.1-11.3% improved). Relative to no opioid use, persistent users had higher odds of severe/extreme PIA (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95-4.32; P &lt; 0.001) and moderate PIA (AOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.31-3.20; P &lt; 0.01) at follow-up. For patients with baseline functional limitations, persistent opioid users were more likely to report physical and work limitations at follow-up (both P &lt; 0.05). For patients without baseline functional limitations, persistent opioid users had higher odds than those without use of reporting IADL, physical, social, and cognitive limitations at follow-up (all P &lt; 0.05); intermittent users were more likely to report physical and social limitations (both P &lt; 0.05). Persistent opioid use for pain in patients with OA appeared to be associated with poorer PIA and functional outcomes, regardless of baseline functional status. These findings highlight the importance of patient-reported outcomes for opioid benefit-risk assessment and suggest the need for alternative analgesic approaches.","Activities of Daily Living;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Benefit-Risk Assessment;Cognition;Cohort Studies;Community Dwelling;Confidence Intervals;Expenditures;Female;Functional Status;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Needs;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patients;Population;Regression Analysis;Relatives;Report;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;Whites;Work;Young Adult",Opioid-Related Disorders;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Adv Ther,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31882029,2019,Effect of FDA Warning on Codeine and Alternate Opioid Prescribing After Pediatric Dental Procedures in Ohio.,"Purpose: Evaluate changes in codeine and alternate opioid prescription filling after pediatric dental procedures associated with the FDA's codeine black box warning for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy. Methods: Patients aged 0-17 years who underwent any tooth extraction or restorative procedure during August 2011-August 2016 were identified in Ohio Medicaid claims. Interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the FDA's warning on the rates of codeine or alternative opioid prescription fills within 14 days postprocedure. Results: In August 2011, codeine and alternative opioid prescription fills rates after a dental procedure were 2.3 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. These rates decreased monthly by 0.02 and 0.01 percent, respectively during the study period (P&lt;0.0001). The FDA warning was associated with an immediate drop in codeine prescription filling of 0.4 percent (P&lt;0.001), but there was no such association with alternative opioid prescription filling. The codeine decrease was only significant among extractions with/without concurrent restorative procedures involving males, 12- to 17-year-olds, Caucasians, and small metropolitan area residents. Conclusions: Opioid prescription filling after pediatric dental procedures decreased between 2011 and 2016 among Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, there was a significant immediate reduction in codeine prescription filling after the FDA's codeine black box warning for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy.","Adenoidectomy;Adolescent;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Black Box Warning;Child;Child, Preschool;Codeine;Drug Prescriptions;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Male;Medicaid;Methods;Ohio;Opioids;Patients;Pediatrics;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Procedures;Tonsillectomy;Tooth Extraction;United States",,Pediatr Dent,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31926361,2020,Implications of Drug Use Disorders on Spine Surgery.,"The opioid crisis has been declared a ""public health emergency."" Spine surgeons are treating more patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). To investigate the outcomes of patients with SUD who undergo spine surgery. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with SUD who underwent nonelective spine surgery by orthopedic or neurosurgical staff from 2012 to 2017 at a level 1 trauma center and spine referral center. Three elective cases were excluded. A total of 49 patients undergoing 72 surgeries were reviewed. The most common substances of abuse were opioids (44/49 patients; 90%). Of 31 patients using multisubstances (63%), 29 misused opioids. The most common indications for surgery were infection (26/49, 53%), trauma (13/49, 27%), and myelopathy (7/49, 14%). Fusions (35/49, 71%) and irrigation and debridement surgeries (12/49, 24%) predominated. Twenty-nine percent (14/49) of patients had complications, the most common being hardware failure (7/49, 14%). Twenty percent (10/49) of patients left against medical advice and 22% (11/49) did not follow up after hospital discharge. The average length of hospital stay was 22 days. Forty-five percent (22/49) of patients were known to be in a drug program preoperatively versus 39% (19/49) postoperatively. Sixty-five percent (32/49) were prescribed opioids in the immediate postoperative period and 47% (23/49) continued to abuse drugs postoperatively. Patients with SUD are at increased risk of complications and inadequate follow-up. Additional studies are warranted to determine whether additional perioperative education, psychiatry consultations, or prescription of opioid addiction treatment regimens will improve drug use cessation and outcomes.",Adult;Chart;Consultation;Debridement;Drug Abuse;Drug Use Disorders;Education;Emergencies;Female;General Surgery;Hospital Stay;Hospitals;Humans;Infections;Male;Middle Aged;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Orthopedic Procedures;Orthopedics;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;Prescriptions;Program;Psychiatry;Public Health;Referral;Retrospective Studies;Review;Risk;Spinal Cord Diseases;Spinal Diseases;Spine;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surgeons;Therapeutics;Trauma Centers;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult,Drug Abuse;Drug Use Disorders;Infections;Opioid-Related Disorders;Postoperative Complications;Spinal Cord Diseases;Spinal Diseases;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries,World Neurosurg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31939768,2020,Intergroup anxiety in pain care: impact on treatment recommendations made by white providers for black patients.,"Race disparities in pain care are well-documented. Given that most black patients are treated by white providers, patient-provider racial discordance is one hypothesized contributor to these disparities. Research and theory suggest that providers' trait-level intergroup anxiety impacts their state-level comfort while treating patients, which, in turn, impacts their pain treatment decisions. To test these hypothesized relationships, we conducted a planned secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a perspective-taking intervention to reduce pain treatment disparities. Mediation analyses were conducted on treatment decision data from white providers for black virtual patients with chronic pain. Results indicated that white providers with higher trait-level intergroup anxiety reported lower state-level comfort treating black patients and were thereby more likely to recommend opioid (indirect effect = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-1.51) and pain specialty (indirect effect = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.26-1.78) treatments and less likely to recommend nonopioid analgesics (indirect effect = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.94 to -0.12). Neither trait-level intergroup anxiety nor state-level comfort significantly influenced provider decisions for physical therapy. This study provides important new information about intrapersonal and interpersonal contributors to race disparities in chronic pain care. These findings suggest that intergroup anxiety and the resulting situational discomfort encroach on the clinical decision-making process by influencing white providers' decisions about which pain treatments to recommend to black patients. Should these findings be replicated in future studies, they would support interventions to help providers become more aware of their trait-level intergroup anxiety and manage their state-level reactions to patients who are racially/ethnically different from themselves.","African Americans;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Anxiety;Blacks;Chronic Pain;Clinical Decision-Making;Confidence Intervals;Future;Humans;Mediation Analysis;News;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Physical Therapy;Racial Stocks;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Therapeutics;Whites",Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
31991879,2020,Regulation of Synaptic Development by Astrocyte Signaling Factors and Their Emerging Roles in Substance Abuse.,"Astrocytes have critical functions throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and have emerged as regulators of synaptic development and function. With their highly complex morphologies, they are able to interact with thousands of synapses via peripheral astrocytic processes (PAPs), ensheathing neuronal axons and dendrites to form the tripartite synapse. In this way, astrocytes engage in crosstalk with neurons to mediate a variety of CNS processes including the regulation of extracellular matrix protein signaling, formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), axon growth and guidance, homeostasis of the synaptic microenvironment, synaptogenesis, and the promotion of synaptic diversity. In this review, we discuss several key astrocyte signaling factors (thrombospondins, netrins, apolipoproteins, neuregulins, bone morphogenetic proteins, and neuroligins) in the maintenance and regulation of synapse formation. We also explore how these astrocyte signaling factors are impacted by and contribute to substance abuse, particularly alcohol and cocaine use.","Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Alcohols;Apolipoproteins;Astrocytes;Axons;Blood-Brain Barrier;Bone Morphogenetic Proteins;Central Nervous System;Cocaine;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Dendrites;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Form;Growth;Homeostasis;Humans;Maintenance;Netrins;Neuregulins;Neurons;Receptors, Presynaptic;Regulation;Review;Role;Signal Transduction;Substance Abuse;Synapses;Thrombospondins",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,Cells,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32123930,2020,Temporal Trends and Geographic Variations in Mortality Rates from Prescription Opioids: Lessons from Florida and West Virginia.,"To explore temporal trends and geographic variations in mortality from prescription opioids from 1999 to 2016. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Multiple Cause of Death files were used to calculate age-adjusted rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and create spatial cluster maps. From 1999 to 2016, counties in West Virginia experienced the highest overall mortality rates in the United States from prescription opioids. Specifically, from 1999 to 2004, the highest rate in West Virginia of 24.87/100,000 (95% CI 17.84-33.73) was the fourth highest in the United States. From 2005 to 2009, West Virginia experienced the highest rate in the United States, 60.72/100,000 (95% CI 47.33-76.71). From 2010 to 2016, West Virginia also experienced the highest rate in the United States, which was 90.24/100,000 (95% CI 73.11-107.36). As such, overall, West Virginia experienced the highest rates in the United States and the largest increases overall of ~3.6-fold between 1999 and 2004 and 2010 and 2016. From 1999 to 2004, Florida had no ""hot spots,"" but from 2006 to 2010 they did appear, and from 2011 to 2016, they disappeared. These data show markedly divergent temporal trends and geographic variations in mortality rates from prescription opioids, especially in the southern United States. Specifically, although initial rates were high and continued to increase alarmingly in West Virginia, they increased but then decreased in Florida. These descriptive data generate hypotheses requiring testing in analytic epidemiological studies. Understanding the divergent patterns of prescription opioid-related deaths, especially in West Virginia and Florida, may have important clinical and policy implications.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Cause of Death;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Comprehension;Confidence Intervals;Death;Death Rate;Epidemiologic Studies;Florida;Geographic Mapping;Humans;Map;Mortality;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Policy;Prescriptions;Research;Time Factors;United States;West Virginia",Death;Opioid-Related Disorders,South Med J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32142138,2020,Opioid Prescription Filling Trends Among Children with Sickle Cell Disease After the Release of State-Issued Guidelines on Pain Management.,"To assess the impact of Ohio's 2012, 2013, and 2016 opioid prescribing guidelines on opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescription filling and health care utilization for pain among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study. Ohio Medicaid claims data from August 2011 to August 2016. Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 years with SCD. Interrupted time series analyses comparing population-level rates of opioids and NSAID prescriptions filled, standardized amounts of opioids dispensed, and acute health care utilization for pain before and after release of each guideline. In our cohort of 1,505 children with SCD, there was a temporary but significant decrease in the opioid filling rate (-2.96 prescriptions per 100 children, P = 0.01) and in the amount of opioids dispensed (-31.39 milligram morphine equivalents per filled prescription, P &lt; 0.001) after the 2013 guideline but a temporary but significant increase in the opioid filling rate (7.44 prescriptions per 100 children, P &lt; 0.001) and in the amount of opioids dispensed (72.73 mg morphine equivalents per filled prescription, P &lt; 0.001) after the 2016 guideline. The NSAID filling rate did not significantly change after any of the guidelines. Acute health care utilization rates for pain after the 2016 guideline were similar to those before the 2013 guideline (rate ratio = 1.04, P = 0.63). Our results suggest that Ohio's 2013 and 2016 guidelines were associated with significant but nonsustained changes in opioid prescription filling among children with SCD. Additional studies are needed to confirm that opioid guidelines have a sustained impact on excessive opioid prescribing, filling, and misuse.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal;Child;Cohort Studies;Drug Prescriptions;Guideline;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Medicaid;Morphine;Ohio;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;United States;Young Adult","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Pain",Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32201267,2020,Dim Light at Night Exposure Induces Cold Hyperalgesia and Mechanical Allodynia in Male Mice.,"The growing presence of artificial lighting across the globe presents a number of challenges to human and ecological health despite its societal benefits. Exposure to artificial light at night, a seemingly innocuous aspect of modern life, disrupts behavior and physiological functions. Specifically, light at night induces neuroinflammation, which is implicated in neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, including hyperalgesia and allodynia. Because of its influence on neuroinflammation, we investigated the effects of dim light at night exposure on pain responsiveness in male mice. In this study, mice exposed to four days of dim (5 lux) light at night exhibited cold hyperalgesia. Further, after 28 days of exposure, mice exhibited both cold hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. No heat/hot hyperalgesia was observed in this experiment. Altered nociception in mice exposed to dim light at night was concurrent with upregulated interleukin-6 and nerve growth factor mRNA expression in the medulla and elevated μ-opioid receptor mRNA expression in the periaqueductal gray region of the brain. The current results support the relationship between disrupted circadian rhythms and altered pain sensitivity. In summary, we observed that dim light at night induces cold hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, potentially through elevated neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system.","Allodynia;Animals;Behavior;Brain;Circadian Rhythm;Cold Temperature;Health;Heat;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Interleukin-6;Life;Light;Lighting;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Nerve Growth Factors;Nociception;Nociceptive Pain;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain Threshold;Periaqueductal Gray;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Sensitivity",Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Mechanical Allodynia;Nociceptive Pain;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Neuroscience,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32217114,2020,New persistent opioid use after acute opioid prescribing in pregnancy: a nationwide analysis.,"To evaluate the association between opioid prescribing during pregnancy and new persistent opioid use in the year following delivery. This nationwide retrospective cohort study included patients aged 12-55 years in Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database who were undergoing vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery from 2008 to 2016, with continuous enrollment from 2 years before birth to 1 year postdischarge. Women were included if they were opioid naive in pregnancy (ie, did not fill an opioid prescription 2 years to 9 months before delivery) and did not undergo a procedure within the year after discharge. The exposure was filling an opioid prescription in pregnancy. The primary outcome was new persistent opioid use, defined as a pharmacy claim for ≥1 opioid prescription between 4 and 90 days postdischarge and ≥1 prescription between 91 and 365 days postdischarge. Clinical and demographic covariates were included. Analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for clinical and demographic covariates. Of 158,425 childbirths identified, 101,013 (63.8%) were by vaginal delivery and 57,412 (36.2%) cesarean delivery. Among all patients, 6.0% (9429) filled an opioid prescription during pregnancy. The factors associated with filling an opioid in pregnancy were having a nondelivery procedure in pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 9.60; 95% confidence interval, 8.81-10.47) and having an emergency room visit during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.37-2.59). Of women who received an opioid in pregnancy, 4% (379) developed new persistent opioid use. The factors most associated with new persistent opioid use were receiving an opioid prescription during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 3.04-3.92) and filling a peripartum opioid prescription (1 week prior to 3 days postdischarge) adjusted odds ratio, 2.28, 95% confidence interval (2.02-2.57). Though having a procedure during pregnancy was associated with increased receipt of an opioid prescription, it was also associated with reduced new persistent opioid use (adjusted odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.99). Women who receive an opioid prescription during pregnancy are more likely to experience new persistent opioid use. Maternity care providers must balance pain management in pregnancy with potential risks of opioids.","Abdominal Pain;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Back Pain;Cesarean Section;Childbirth;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Data Mart;Database;Delivery, Obstetric;Demography;Emergency Service, Hospital;Ethnic Groups;Female;Hospitalization;Humans;Income;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Mental Disorders;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Parturition;Patients;Peripartum Period;Pharmacy;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Prescriptions;Procedures;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Statistics;Urinary Tract Infections;Women;Young Adult",Abdominal Pain;Back Pain;Mental Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pregnancy Complications;Urinary Tract Infections,Am J Obstet Gynecol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32229609,2021,Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS): A Transgenerational Echo of the Opioid Crisis.,"The incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) has increased substantially in the setting of the opioid epidemic, a major public health problem in the United States. At present, NOWS has commonly used assessment and treatment protocols, but new protocols have questioned old practices. However, because of limited access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and socioeconomic factors, many pregnant (and postpartum) women with OUD do not receive treatment. The pathophysiology of NOWS is not completely understood, although limited research studies have been conducted in humans and animals to better understand its etiology. Moreover, there is evidence that epigenetic and genetic factors play a role in the development of NOWS, but further study is needed. Animal models have suggested that there are deleterious effects of in utero opioid exposure later in life. Clinical research has revealed the harmful long-term sequelae of NOWS, with respect to cognitive function and childhood development. Many psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence, so as infants born with NOWS approach adolescence, additional clinical and molecular studies are warranted to identify biologic and psychosocial risk factors and long-term effects of NOWS. Additionally, access to specialized OUD treatment for pregnant women must be more readily available in the United States, especially in rural areas.","Adolescence;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Biopharmaceuticals;Cognition;Epigenetics;Female;Genetics;Humans;Incidence;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Life;Longterm Effects;Mental Disorders;Models, Animal;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Play;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Public Health;Research;Respect;Risk Factors;Role;Socioeconomic Factors;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Treatment Protocols;United States",Mental Disorders;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Syndrome,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32276749,2020,Medication Treatment and Health Care Use Among Adolescents With Opioid Use Disorder in Ohio.,"The opioid epidemic impacts both adolescents and adults, and overdose deaths continue to rise. Two medication treatments (buprenorphine and naltrexone) are effective for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) in office-based settings but are seldom prescribed to adolescents. The present study describes medication treatment for OUD and other care received by adolescents with OUD in a state at the center of the opioid epidemic. This retrospective cohort study included adolescents (aged 12-18 years) enrolled in Ohio Medicaid with an index OUD diagnosis (August 1, 2012, to May 31, 2016). Analyses describe the proportion of adolescents who received medication for OUD, health care (general medical outpatient, behavioral health, hospitalization, and emergency department), and other medications (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and opioid analgesics) within 3 months after OUD diagnosis. The results are compared by age group (12-15 and 16-18 years). Among 626,508 adolescents enrolled in Medicaid, 2,097 met inclusion criteria. Overall, 4.6% received medication for OUD, whereas 9.8% received an opioid analgesic, within 3 months after OUD diagnosis. The proportion of older adolescents receiving medication for OUD was significantly higher than younger adolescents (5.9% vs. 1.2%; p &lt; .001), whereas a higher proportion of younger adolescents received attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Low proportions of adolescents in both age groups received benzodiazepines (2.4% and 3.6%). During the 3 months after OUD diagnosis, 48.5% of adolescents had general medical outpatient visits, and 29% received outpatient behavioral health services. Although a large proportion of adolescents with OUD have subsequent visits in outpatient settings, few receive medications to treat OUD.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Antidepressive Agents;Antipsychotic Agents;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Benzodiazepine;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Death;Delivery of Health Care;Diagnosis;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Health Care;Health Services;Hospitalization;Humans;Index;Medicaid;Naltrexone;Ohio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Outpatients;Overall;Retrospective Studies;Therapeutics;United States",Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Adolesc Health,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32322780,2019,Recent advances toward understanding the mysteries of the acute to chronic pain transition.,"Chronic pain affects up to a third of the population. Ongoing epidemiology studies suggest that the impact of chronic pain on the population is accelerating [1]. While advances have been made in understanding how chronic pain develops, there are still many important mysteries about how acute pain transitions to a chronic state. In this review, I summarize recent developments in the field with a focus on several areas of emerging research that are likely to have an important impact on the field. These include mechanisms of cellular plasticity that drive chronic pain, evidence of pervasive sex differential mechanisms in chronic pain and the profound impact that next generation sequencing technologies are having on this area of research.",Acute Pain;Affect;Cell Plasticity;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Drive;Epidemiology;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Population;Research;Review;Sex;Technology,Acute Pain;Chronic Pain,Curr Opin Physiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32330472,2020,Minimally Invasive Repair of Adult Slipped Rib Syndrome Without Costal Cartilage Excision.,"Slipped rib syndrome (SRS) is a painful disorder caused when 1 or more of the 8th-10th false ribs become abnormally mobile. Established treatment modalities include analgesia, intercostal nerve injection, and costal cartilage excision. No definitive surgical correction of SRS without cartilage excision has been previously described. We aimed to determine whether a nonexcisional repair technique in affected adults could demonstrate significant relief from SRS using standardized outcome measures. We performed a retrospective review of cases of SRS treated at our institution in 2019. We obtained data by survey before and after sutured 10th rib fixation, using a self-reported rating scale from 0-10 at defined intervals. Surveyed outcome measures were compared pre- and postoperatively using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. The use of neural modulating, narcotic, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug medications was also compared pre- and postoperatively using McNemar's test where applicable. SRS was diagnosed using clinical examination alone in 42 adults and repaired in 29 patients. Median postoperative improvement in pain at 1 and 6 months was 75% (P &lt; .001) and 80% (P &lt; .001), respectively. Improvements in other outcome measures were similar. In patients who took pain medications preoperatively, narcotics were discontinued at 1 month by 100%, neural modulators by 86%, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs by 92% (all P values &lt; .001). Pain medication use remained minimal at 6 months in 23 (79%) of patients completing follow-up. Minimally invasive slipped rib repair in adults provides significant relief of SRS, offering a useful alternative to costal cartilage excision. It is well tolerated and effective.",Adult;Analgesia;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Cartilage;Costal Cartilage;Female;Humans;Injections;Intercostal Nerves;Male;Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures;Narcotics;Orthopedic Procedures;Outcome Measures;Pain;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rank-Sum Tests;Review;Ribs;Scales;Self;Surveys;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Tietze's Syndrome;Treatment Outcome,Pain;Syndrome;Tietze's Syndrome,Ann Thorac Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32333589,2020,The Association of Osteoarthritis and Related Pain Burden to Incident Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A Retrospective Cohort Study of U.S. Medicare Beneficiaries.,"Emerging evidence suggests osteoarthritis (OA) and related symptom burden may increase risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, longitudinal studies are sparse, and none have examined the potential mediating effects of mood or sleep disorders. To determine the association of OA and related pain to incident ADRD in U.S. elders. In this retrospective cohort study, we used baseline and two-year follow-up data from linked Medicare claims and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey files (11 pooled cohorts, 2001-2013). The study sample comprised 16,934 community-dwelling adults≥65 years, ADRD-free at baseline and enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of OA and related pain (back, neck, joint, neuropathic) to incident ADRD, explore the mediating inlfuence of mood and insomnia-related sleep disorders, and (sensitivity analyses) account for potential survival bias. Overall, 25.5% of beneficiaries had OA at baseline (21.0% with OA and pain); 1149 elders (5.7%) were subsequently diagnosed with ADRD. Compared to beneficiaries without OA, those with OA were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of incident ADRD after adjustment for sociodemographics, lifestyle characteristics, comorbidities, and medications (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 1.42). Elders with OA and pain at baseline were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with incident ADRD than were those without OA or pain (AOR = 1.31, CI 1.08, 1.58). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings. Inclusion of depression/anxiety, but not sleep disorders, substantially attenuated these associations. Findings of this study suggest that: OA is associated with elevated ADRD risk, this association is particularly pronounced in those with OA and pain, and mood disorders may partially mediate this relationship.","Adjustment;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease;Anxiety;Arthritis;Association;Back Pain;Bias;Cognition;Cohort Studies;Community Dwelling;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Dementia;Depression;Diagnosis;Fee-for-Service Plans;Female;Humans;Incidence;Joints;Life Style;Logistic Regression;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Mediating;Medicare;Middle Aged;Mood;Mood Disorders;Neck;Odds Ratio;Osteoarthritis;Overall;Pain;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Sensitivity;Sleep;Sleep Disorders;Sleeplessness;Surveys;Survival;United States",Alzheimer Disease;Arthritis;Back Pain;Dementia;Mood Disorders;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Sleep Disorders;Sleeplessness,J Alzheimers Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32421193,2021,Ethnic Differences in Experimental Pain Responses Following a Paired Verbal Suggestion With Saline Infusion: A Quasiexperimental Study.,"Ethnic differences in placebo and nocebo responses are an important, yet underresearched, patient factor that might contribute to treatment disparities. The purpose of this study was to examine ethnic differences in pain trajectories following a verbal suggestion paired with a masked, inert substance (i.e., saline). Using a quasiexperimental design, we examined differences between 21 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) participants and 20 non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants in capsaicin-related pain rating trajectories following a nondirectional verbal suggestion + saline infusion. All participants were told that the substance would ""either increase pain sensation, decrease it, or leave it unchanged."" A spline mixed model was used to quantify the interaction of ethnicity and time on ratings. There was a significant Ethnicity × Time interaction effect (β = -0.28, p = .002); NHB individuals reported significantly greater increases in pain following, but not before, the verbal suggestion + saline infusion. Sensitivity analyses showed no change in primary results based on differences in education level, general pain sensitivity, or condition order. The present results showed ethnic differences in pain response trajectories following a verbal suggestion + saline infusion and suggest that future research rigorously examining possible ethnic differences in placebo/nocebo responses is warranted.",Adult;Blacks;Capsaicin;Education;Ethnic Groups;Female;Future;Hispanics;Humans;Male;Nocebo Effect;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain Perception;Patients;Placebo Effect;Placebos;Research;Saline Solution;Sensation;Sensitivity;Suggestion;Therapeutics;Time;Whites,Pain,Ann Behav Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32423718,2020,Sexual Assault in Adolescents.,"Child sexual abuse is a severely underreported crime in the United States. The consequences of child sexual abuse extend beyond physical injury, including an increased likelihood to develop chronic physical and mental diseases/disorders, including substance abuse and suicide. Care involves trauma-informed screening, assessment, and documentation, education of, and access to sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis and emergency contraception, safety interventions, and access to community resources. Medical providers should know the response process their facility, community, and state practices for victims of sexual abuse.

32487365,2020,Inappropriate Preoperative Gabapentinoid Use Among Patients With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"Gabapentinoids are commonly prescribed for the treatment of neuropathic pain but are not recommended for the primary treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). We sought (1) to investigate the preoperative use of gabapentinoids for the treatment of CTS and (2) to determine whether preoperative exposure is associated with persistent gabapentinoid and opioid use after carpal tunnel release. We performed a retrospective cohort study using IBM MarketScan Research Databases (2010-2017) of patients who did not fill a gabapentinoid or opioid prescription within 3 months of a new CTS diagnosis undergoing surgical release. Our primary outcomes included preoperative gabapentinoid prescription fills associated with CTS and persistent prescription fills of gabapentinoids and opioids at 91 to 180 days after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between patient-level factors and persistent gabapentinoid and opioid use. Of the 56,593 patients without a previous gabapentinoid or opioid prescription prior to diagnosis of CTS, 3,474 patients (6%) filled a gabapentinoid prescription before carpal tunnel release. Overall, 835 patients (24% of the preoperative users) continued to fill gabapentinoid prescriptions at 91 to 180 days after surgery. Of the preoperative gabapentinoid users, 20% (702 patients) continued to fill opioid prescriptions at 91 to 80 days after release. After adjusting for patient characteristics, preoperative gabapentinoid use was associated with increased odds of persistent postoperative gabapentinoid use (preoperative gabapentinoid, 22% adjusted probability; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 20.3%-23.0%, no preoperative gabapentinoid use, 1%; 95% CI, 1.2%-1.4%) and persistent postoperative opioid use (preoperative gabapentinoid, 18% adjusted probability; 95% CI, 17%-20%), no preoperative gabapentinoid, 9%; 95% CI, 8.6%-9.1%). Despite a lack of evidence to support the use of gabapentinoids for CTS, 6% of patients are prescribed a gabapentinoid prior to surgery, and prolonged use is common. Given the effectiveness of surgical release and the risks associated with gabapentinoids, greater attention is needed to ensure that gabapentinoids are prescribed appropriately, avoided when possible, and stopped after surgery.

32507420,2020,Integrative approaches to treating pain in sickle cell disease: Pre-clinical and clinical evidence.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by hemolysis, end-organ damage, inflammation, and pain. Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises are a unique feature of SCD. Many patients also develop lifelong chronic pain. Opioids are the primary method of pain treatment in SCD; however, continued use is associated with several adverse effects. Integrative approaches to treating pain in SCD are increasingly being explored to prevent the side effects associated with opioids. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of pain in SCD and describe mechanism-based integrative approaches for treating pain.","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Chronic Pain;Hemolysis;Hereditary Diseases;Humans;Inflammation;Methods;Mice;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Review;Therapeutics","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hemolysis;Hereditary Diseases;Inflammation;Pain",Complement Ther Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32540284,2020,Retrospective Assessment of the Use of Liposomal Bupivacaine in Lumbar Fusions in Immediate Postoperative Hospital Care.,"Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for administration into surgical sites for postsurgical analgesia. The liposomal formulation allows for sustained effects up to 72 hours. A retrospective study assessed patients undergoing lumbar interbody surgery. Visual analog scale pain scores and amount of opioids consumed were recorded at 12-hour intervals for 72 hours postoperatively, as were patterns of discharge and hospital length of stay (LOS). A total of 122 patients (97 LB vs. 25 control group) were reviewed. Median LOS was shorter in the LB cohort compared with controls (1.94 vs. 3.08 days, respectively; P = 0.0043). When assessing the percentage of discharges between groups at 12-hour intervals, there were significantly more discharges in the LB cohort at 36-48 hours (P = 0.0226), and no differences elsewhere. There was a decrease in intravenous opioids consumed at 48-60 hours in the LB cohort compared with controls (P = 0.0494), a difference not detected at other time points or with oral or total opioids. Mean visual analog scale scores were significantly higher in the LB cohort compared with controls at 0-12 hours (5.2 vs. 3.9, respectively; P = 0.0079), but insignificantly different subsequently up to 72 hours. The LB cohort and controls were not significantly different in total amount of opioids consumed, overall pain scores, or regarding how the opioid amount consumed or pain scores changed over time. The use of LB in lumbar interbody fusion decreases patients' LOS but has little effect on reducing overall pain scores or opioid use in the 72-hour postoperative hospital period.","Administration;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesia;Anesthetics, Local;Bupivacaine;Control Groups;Female;General Surgery;Hospitals;Humans;Length of Stay;Liposomes;Lumbosacral Region;Male;Middle Aged;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Retrospective Studies;Spinal Diseases;Spinal Fusion;Spine;Time;United States Food and Drug Administration;Visual Analog Scale;Young Adult","Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Spinal Diseases",World Neurosurg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32661512,2020,The Association of Beta-Blocker Use to Cognitive Impairment among Adults with Hypertension or Cardiovascular Diseases in the United States.,"Some studies have shown that beta-blocker use is associated with better cognitive impairment. However, these studies did not control for pain. The relationship between pain and cognitive impairment has been exhaustively investigated. The association of beta blockers to cognitive impairment in the presence of chronic pain is still unknown. To examine the independent association of beta-blocker use to cognitive impairment among adults with hypertension or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). We used a cross-sectional study design. We derived data on 8,279 adults from the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Study participants were adults (age &gt; 21 years), with hypertension or CVDs and without intracranial injury, Parkinson, Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia. Cognitive impairment was measured based on 1) confusion or memory loss; 2) problems making decisions, or 3) supervision for participant's safety. Anti-hypertensive medications were categorized into 1) beta-blockers; 2) other anti-hypertensives; and 3) no antihypertensive medication. We used multivariable survey logistic regressions to examine the association between beta-blockers and cognitive impairment after controlling for biological factors, pain, chronic conditions, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare services, behavioral, socio-cultural and external environmental factors. Overall, 24.2%, 41.9%, and 33.9% reported using beta-blockers, other antihypertensives, and no antihypertensive medications, respectively; 18.1% participants reported cognitive impairment. After controlling for pain, beta-blocker use was not significantly associated with cognitive impairment (AOR= 1.22, 95%CI= 1.00-1.49). In fully adjusted models, the AOR for beta-blockers use was 1.05 (95%CI = 0.84-1.31). In this first large cross-sectional study, we found that the use of beta-blockers was not associated with cognitive impairment.

32705966,2020,Pharmacogenomics of methadone: a narrative review of the literature.,"Background: Methadone, a synthetic opioid with longer duration of action and lower abuse potential compared with morphine, is used to prevent opioid withdrawal, as well as to manage chronic and acute surgical pain. The variability in response to methadone has been widely recognized. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the pharmacogenetic factors underlying this variability. Materials &amp; methods: This is a narrative overview of the literature on the genetic variants affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of methadone, retrieved from searches of databases such as PubMed and google scholar. Discussion: Clinical responses to methadone may be affected by genetic variants in the opioidergic, dopaminergic and neurotrophic pathways. Polymorphisms in genes related to disposition and elimination of methadone alter the pharmacokinetics, and possibly pharmacodynamics of methadone. Cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein variants contribute to the interindividual variability in methadone pharmacokinetics. Evidence for single gene variants affecting methadone response remains weak. Multiple genetic variants must be considered in conjunction to improve predictive ability. Conclusion: Evidence remains scarce at this time, to recommend pharmacogenetic testing before methadone administration. Well-powered clinical studies are needed with population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and multigenetic signature-based predictions to enable tailored use of methadone in clinical practice.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B;Ability;Administration;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Clinical Study;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Database;Genes;Genetic Variation;Genetics;Humans;Literature;Maintenance;Methadone;Methods;Morphine;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Pharmacogenomics;Pharmacokinetics;Population;PubMed;Review;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Pharmacogenomics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32729340,2021,Heme Causes Pain in Sickle Mice via Toll-Like Receptor 4-Mediated Reactive Oxygen Species- and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Glial Activation.,"Aims: Lifelong pain is a hallmark feature of sickle cell disease (SCD). How sickle pathobiology evokes pain remains unknown. We hypothesize that increased cell-free heme due to ongoing hemolysis activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Together, these processes lead to spinal microglial activation and neuroinflammation, culminating in acute and chronic pain. Results: Spinal heme levels, TLR4 transcripts, oxidative stress, and ER stress were significantly higher in sickle mice than controls. In vitro, TLR4 inhibition in spinal cord microglial cells attenuated heme-induced ROS and ER stress. Heme treatment led to a time-dependent increase in the characteristic features of sickle pain (mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia) in both sickle and control mice; this effect was absent in TLR4-knockout sickle and control mice. TLR4 deletion in sickle mice attenuated chronic and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-evoked acute hyperalgesia. Sickle mice treated with the TLR4 inhibitor resatorvid; selective small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 (TAK242) had significantly reduced chronic hyperalgesia and had less severe H/R-evoked acute pain with quicker recovery. Notably, reducing ER stress with salubrinal ameliorated chronic hyperalgesia in sickle mice. Innovation: Our findings demonstrate the causal role of free heme in the genesis of acute and chronic sickle pain and suggest that TLR4 and/or ER stress are novel therapeutic targets for treating pain in SCD. Conclusion: Heme-induced microglial activation via TLR4 in the central nervous system contributes to the initiation and maintenance of sickle pain via ER stress in SCD. Antioxid.

32746739,2021,Standardization and Reduction of Narcotics After Pediatric Tonsillectomy.,"(1) To measure caregiver satisfaction with a nonstandardized postoperative pain regimen after pediatric tonsillectomy. (2) To implement a quality improvement project (QIP) to reduce the number and volume of narcotics prescribed and to describe the effect on caregiver satisfaction. A prospective cohort study at a tertiary children's hospital examined postoperative narcotics prescribed to children following adenotonsillectomy. A QIP was implemented 3 months into the observation, with the goal to standardize nonnarcotic analgesics and reduce the volume of narcotics prescribed. Caregivers were called 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively to assess pain control and caregiver satisfaction. Over an 8-month period, 118 patients were recruited (66 before the QIP, 52 after induction). Prior to the QIP, 47% of patients were prescribed postoperative narcotics, as opposed to 27% after the QIP (P &lt; .05). There was a significant reduction in the volume of narcotics prescribed before (mean ± SD, 300 ± 150 mL) versus after (180 ± 111 mL) the initiative (P &lt; .05). The per-kilogram dose did not change over the study time frame. On a 5-point Likert scale, there was no difference in the caregivers' satisfaction regarding pain control before (4.37 ± 0.85) versus after (4.35 ± 1.0) the project started. A system shift was identified with the establishment of a posttonsillectomy pain control protocol associated with a reduction in prescribed narcotics without a significant change in caregiver satisfaction. Implementing a standardized plan for the use of nonnarcotic medications was associated with reduced frequency and volume of narcotics prescribed. Future work will further standardize our postoperative pain regimen.","Adenoidectomy;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Caregivers;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;Drug Prescriptions;Female;Future;Goals;Hospitals;Humans;Male;Measures;Narcotics;Observation;Otolaryngology;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Pediatrics;Prospective Studies;Quality Improvement;Satisfaction;Scales;Standardization;Time Studies;Tonsillectomy;Work","Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32751107,2020,"Non-Cancer Chronic Pain Conditions and Risk for Incident Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study of United States Medicare Beneficiaries, 2001-2013.","Accumulating evidence suggests that certain chronic pain conditions may increase risk for incident Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Rigorous longitudinal research remains relatively sparse, and the relation of overall chronic pain condition burden to ADRD risk remains little studied, as has the potential mediating role of sleep and mood disorders. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the association of common non-cancer chronic pain conditions (NCPC) at baseline to subsequent risk for incident ADRD, and assessed the potential mediating effects of mood and sleep disorders, using baseline and 2-year follow-up data using 11 pooled cohorts (2001-2013) drawn from the U.S. Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey (MCBS). The study sample comprised 16,934 community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 and ADRD-free at baseline. NCPC included: headache, osteoarthritis, joint pain, back or neck pain, and neuropathic pain, ascertained using claims data; incident ADRD (N = 1149) was identified using claims and survey data. NCPC at baseline remained associated with incident ADRD after adjustment for sociodemographics, lifestyle characteristics, medical history, medications, and other factors (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for any vs. no NCPC = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.40; p = 0.003); the strength and magnitude of this association rose significantly with increasing number of diagnosed NCPCs (AOR for 4+ vs. 0 conditions = 1.91, CI = 1.31-2.80, p-trend &lt; 0.00001). Inclusion of sleep disorders and/or depression/anxiety modestly reduced these risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings.

32773600,2021,Sex-dependent role of microglia in disulfide high mobility group box 1 protein-mediated mechanical hypersensitivity.,"High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is increasingly regarded as an important player in the spinal regulation of chronic pain. Although it has been reported that HMGB1 induces spinal glial activation in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependent fashion, the aspect of sexual dimorphisms has not been thoroughly addressed. Here, we examined whether the action of TLR4-activating, partially reduced disulfide HMGB1 on microglia induces nociceptive behaviors in a sex-dependent manner. We found disulfide HMGB1 to equally increase microglial Iba1 immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal dorsal horn in male and female mice, but evoke higher cytokine and chemokine expression in primary microglial culture derived from males compared to females. Interestingly, TLR4 ablation in myeloid-derived cells, which include microglia, only protected male mice from developing HMGB1-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Spinal administration of the glial inhibitor, minocycline, with disulfide HMGB1 also prevented pain-like behavior in male mice. To further explore sex difference, we examined the global spinal protein expression using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and found several antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory proteins to be upregulated in only male mice subjected to minocycline. One of the proteins elevated, alpha-1-antitrypsin, partially protected males but not females from developing HMGB1-induced pain. Targeting downstream proteins of alpha-1-antitrypsin failed to produce robust sex differences in pain-like behavior, suggesting that several proteins identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are required to modulate the effects. Taken together, the current study highlights the importance of mapping sex dimorphisms in pain mechanisms and point to processes potentially involved in the spinal antinociceptive effect of microglial inhibition in male mice.","Administration;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Behavior;Cells;Chemokines;Chromatography, Liquid;Chronic Pain;Culture;Cytokines;Disulfides;Female;HMGB1 Protein;Hypersensitivity;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Mice;Microglia;Minocycline;Neuroglia;Pain;Proteins;Regulation;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Toll-Like Receptors;alpha 1-Antitrypsin",Chronic Pain;Hypersensitivity;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32885815,2020,Adapting to disruption of research during the COVID-19 pandemic while testing nonpharmacological approaches to pain management.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed research progress, with particularly disruptive effects on investigations of addressing urgent public health challenges, such as chronic pain. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Defense (DoD) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) supports 11 large-scale, multisite, embedded pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in military and veteran health systems. The PMC rapidly developed and enacted a plan to address key issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PMC tracked and collaborated in developing plans for addressing COVID-19 impacts across multiple domains and characterized the impact of COVID-19 on PCT operations, including delays in recruitment and revisions of study protocols. A harmonized participant questionnaire will facilitate later meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons of the impact of COVID-19 across all 11 PCTs. The pandemic has affected intervention delivery, outcomes, regulatory and ethics issues, participant recruitment, and study design. The PMC took concrete steps to ensure scientific rigor while encouraging flexibility in the PCTs, while paying close attention to minimizing the burden on research participants, investigators, and clinical care teams. Sudden changes in the delivery of pain management interventions will probably alter treatment effects measured via PMC PCTs. Through the use of harmonized instruments and surveys, we are capturing these changes and plan to monitor the impact on research practices, as well as on health outcomes. Analyses of patient-reported measures over time will inform potential relationships between chronic pain, mental health, and various socioeconomic stressors common among Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Address;Attention;Betacoronavirus;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Communicable Disease Control;Coronavirus Infections;Ethics;Health;Humans;Measures;Mental Health;Military Personnel;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Pain Management;Pandemics;Patient Selection;Patients;Pliability;Pneumonia, Viral;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Public Health;Questionnaires;Research;Research Personnel;SARS-CoV-2;Scales;Socioeconomic Factors;Surveys;Therapeutics;Time;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health","COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Communicable Diseases;Coronavirus Infections;Pain;Pneumonia, Viral",Transl Behav Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32886123,2020,Assessment of Probable Opioid Use Disorder Using Electronic Health Record Documentation.,"Electronic health records are a potentially valuable source of information for identifying patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). To evaluate whether proxy measures from electronic health record data can be used reliably to identify patients with probable OUD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5) criteria. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed individuals within the Geisinger health system who were prescribed opioids between December 31, 2000, and May 31, 2017, using a mixed-methods approach. The cohort was identified from 16 253 patients enrolled in a contract-based, Geisinger-specific medication monitoring program (GMMP) for opioid use, including patients who maintained or violated contract terms, as well as a demographically matched control group of 16 253 patients who were prescribed opioids but not enrolled in the GMMP. Substance use diagnoses and psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using automated electronic health record summaries. A manual medical record review procedure using DSM-5 criteria for OUD was completed for a subset of patients. The analysis was conducted beginning from June 5, 2017, until May 29, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of OUD as defined by proxy measures for DSM-5 criteria for OUD as well as the prevalence of comorbidities among patients prescribed opioids within an integrated health system. Among the 16 253 patients enrolled in the GMMP (9309 women [57%]; mean [SD] age, 52 [14] years), OUD diagnoses as defined by diagnostic codes were present at a much lower rate than expected (291 [2%]), indicating the necessity for alternative diagnostic strategies. The DSM-5 criteria for OUD can be assessed using manual medical record review; a manual review of 200 patients in the GMMP and 200 control patients identifed a larger percentage of patients with probable moderate to severe OUD (GMMP, 145 of 200 [73%]; and control, 27 of 200 [14%]) compared with the prevalence of OUD assessed using diagnostic codes. These results suggest that patients with OUD may be identified using information available in the electronic health record, even when diagnostic codes do not reflect this diagnosis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the utility of coding for DSM-5 criteria from medical records to generate a quantitative DSM-5 score that is associated with OUD severity.",Adult;Aged;Coding;Comorbidity;Contracts;Control Groups;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diagnosis;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Documentation;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Humans;Male;Measures;Medical Records;Methods;Middle Aged;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prevalence;Procedures;Program;Proxy;Retrospective Studies;Review;Substance Use;Women,Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32889195,2021,Stigmatizing Diagnoses in Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review.,"Stigma is defined as a social process resulting in labeling, stereotyping, and separation that cause status loss, disapproval, rejection, exclusion, and discrimination of the labeled individuals. Stigma can be experienced by individuals or groups, can be real or perceived, and can include a wide array of characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, and health conditions). It is well documented that stigma for health conditions is a barrier to treatment and leads to worse outcomes for vulnerable people. The purpose of this study is to examine the increasingly mature field of stigma theory and research, and how this relates to the practice of neurosurgery. This review provides an overview of stigma and its application in a neurosurgical setting, including diagnoses treated by neurosurgeons as well as diagnoses with impact on neurosurgical outcomes. Examples of stigmatizing diagnoses of relevance to neurosurgical practice include epilepsy, pain, smoking, obesity, and substance use disorder. This information is useful for the practicing neurosurgeon to understand the origins and higher-order effects of societal perceptions surrounding certain diagnoses, and the subsequent effects on health that those perceptions can create on a systemic level.",Attitude;Diagnosis;Epilepsy;Ethnic Groups;Gender;Health;Humans;Lead;Neurosurgeons;Neurosurgery;Neurosurgical Procedures;Obesity;Pain;Perception;Persons;Racial Stocks;Research;Review;Separation;Smoking;Social Stigma;Stereotyping;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics,Epilepsy;Obesity;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,World Neurosurg,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
32915023,2020,Patient race and opioid misuse history influence provider risk perceptions for future opioid-related problems.,"In response to the dual public health crises of chronic pain and opioid use, providers have become more vigilant about assessing patients for risk of opioid-related problems. Little is known about how providers are making these risk assessments. Given previous studies indicating that Black patients are at increased risk for suboptimal pain care, which may be related to stereotypes about drug abuse, the current study examined how patient race and previous opioid misuse behaviors impact providers' risk assessments for future prescription opioid-related problems. Physician residents and fellows (N = 135) viewed videos and read vignettes about 8 virtual patients with chronic pain who varied by race (Black/White) and history of prescription opioid misuse (absent/present). Providers rated patients' risk for future prescription opioid-related adverse events, misuse/abuse, addiction, and diversion, and also completed measures of implicit racial attitudes and explicit beliefs about race differences in pain. Two significant interactions emerged indicating that Black patients were perceived to be at greater risk for future adverse events (when previous misuse was absent) and diversion (when previous misuse was present). Significant main effects indicated that Black patients and patients with previous misuse were perceived to be at greater risk for future misuse/abuse of prescription opioids, and that patients with previous misuse were perceived to be at greater risk of addiction. These findings suggest that racial minorities and patients with a history of prescription opioid misuse are particularly vulnerable to any unintended consequences of efforts to stem the dual public health crises of chronic pain and opioid use.

32920245,2020,Orbitofrontal sulcogyral morphology in patients with cocaine use disorder.,"Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to be involved in appropriate processing of rewarding stimuli, and abnormal OFC structure and function has been found in patients with substance use disorders. Atypical patterns of the H-sulcus in the OFC have been primarily identified with schizophrenia, but also with bipolar disorder, both of which are associated with comorbid substance use. Given the high rates of substance use within Axis I psychiatric disorders, it is reasonable to consider how frequencies of OFC patterns in populations with only substance use compare to controls. This information is crucial to disentangle whether atypical frequencies of H-sulcus sulcogyral patterns within psychopathology are associated with the psychiatric or substance use phenotype. Here, we present the first analysis of H-sulcus sulcogyral patterns in a population of adult black men with (n = 84) and without (n = 24) cocaine use disorder (CUD). We find that OFC sulcogyral patterns are not significantly different from the control group, indicating that OFC sulcogyral patterns are not disrupted in patients with CUD. As exploratory analyses, we describe OFC sulcogyral pattern subtypes in this cohort as well as an additional control group (n = 52), in order to add to the growing body of literature on OFC sulcogyral pattern characterization.",Adult;Bipolar Disorder;Blacks;Cocaine;Control Groups;Humans;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Men;Mental Disorders;Orbitofrontal Cortex;Patients;Phenotype;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Psychopathology;Schizophrenia;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Thought;Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex,Bipolar Disorder;Mental Disorders;Schizophrenia;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33002757,2020,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and other forms of neuromodulation for substance use disorders: Review of modalities and implications for treatment.","Given the high prevalence of individuals diagnosed with substance use disorder, along with the elevated rate of relapse following treatment initiation, investigating novel approaches and new modalities for substance use disorder treatment is of vital importance. One such approach involves neuromodulation which has been used therapeutically for neurological and psychiatric disorders and has demonstrated positive preliminary findings for the treatment of substance use disorder. The following article provides a review of several forms of neuromodulation which warrant consideration as potential treatments for substance use disorder. PubMed, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were used to identify published articles and clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify currently ongoing or planned studies. Search criteria for Brain Stimulation included the following terminology: transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta burst stimulation, deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation, percutaneous nerve field stimulation, auricular nerve stimulation, and low intensity focused ultrasound. Search criteria for Addiction included the following terminology: addiction, substance use disorder, substance-related disorder, cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamine, alcohol, nicotine, tobacco, smoking, marijuana, cannabis, heroin, opiates, opioids, and hallucinogens. Results revealed that there are currently several forms of neuromodulation, both invasive and non-invasive, which are being investigated for the treatment of substance use disorder. Preliminary findings have demonstrated the potential of these various neuromodulation techniques in improving substance treatment outcomes by reducing those risk factors (e.g. substance craving) associated with relapse. Specifically, transcranial magnetic stimulation has shown the most promise with several well-designed studies supporting the potential for reducing substance craving. Deep brain stimulation has also shown promise, though lacks well-controlled clinical trials to support its efficacy. Transcranial direct current stimulation has also demonstrated promising results though consistently designed, randomized trials are also needed. There are several other forms of neuromodulation which have not yet been investigated clinically but warrant further investigation given their mechanisms and potential efficacy based on findings from other studied indications. In summary, given promising findings in reducing substance use and craving, neuromodulation may provide a non-pharmacological option as a potential treatment and/or treatment augmentation for substance use disorder. Further research investigating neuromodulation, both alone and in combination with already established substance use disorder treatment (e.g. medication treatment), warrants consideration.",Alcohols;Amphetamine;Brain;Cannabis;Cocaine;Controlled Clinical Trial;Craving;Deep Brain Stimulation;Form;Hallucinogens;Heroin;Humans;MEDLINE;Mental Disorders;Methamphetamine;News;Nicotine;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Prevalence;PubMed;Relapse;Research;Review;Risk Factors;Science;Substance Dependence;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Terminology;Therapeutics;Tobacco Smoking;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation;Treatment Outcome;Trigeminal Nerve;Vagus Nerve Stimulation,Mental Disorders;Relapse;Substance Dependence;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Neurol Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33011579,2020,Development of emotion regulation across the first two years of college.,"Emotion regulation is thought to develop substantially from late adolescence into early adulthood; further, the rate of development purportedly varies based on personal and contextual characteristics. However, little research has explicitly documented this maturation in young adulthood or identified its determinants. We aimed to (1) characterize how adaptive (positive reappraisal, emotional social support-seeking) and maladaptive (suppression, substance use coping) emotion regulation strategies changed over time and (2) predict change in each strategy based on baseline personal, social, and motivational characteristics. We followed a sample of 1578 students entering university in the northeastern United States across their first two years, assessing them four times. As expected, social support-seeking increased and suppression decreased. However, contrary to expectations, cognitive reappraisal declined over time while substance use coping increased. Women generally used more adaptive emotion regulation strategies than did men; social engagement and connection and eudaimonic well-being were generally predictive of using more adaptive coping over time. Overall, students did not consistently demonstrate maturation to more adaptive emotion regulation and in fact exhibited decrements over the first two years of college. Students' baseline characteristics accounted for substantial degrees of change in emotion regulation. These findings suggest potentially fruitful directions for interventions to assist college students in developing more adaptive emotion regulation skills.","Adaptation, Psychological;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent Development;Adult;Emotional Regulation;Expectations;Female;Humans;Male;Men;New England;Overall;Research;Social Engagement;Social Support;Students;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;Thought;Time;Universities;Women;Young Adult",Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Adolesc,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33036558,2020,Risk factors associated with infection of blood-borne virus among people who used methamphetamine.,"The surge of methamphetamine use has been a complicating factor compounding the steeply increasing number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. Infection from blood-borne viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV, related to methamphetamine use continue to grow. This study aims to examine the risk factors associated with HBV, HCV and HIV among people who used methamphetamine. People who ever used methamphetamine were identified from five National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts, 2007 to 2016. The outcome was either positive or negative for blood-borne viruses as identified from laboratory tests. Weighted statistics for the combined ten years of data were calculated by multiplying the weighted variable for laboratory measurements by 0.2. We examined the association of sexual activities (sexual partners, sexual identity), drug use behaviors (poly-drug use, injection drug use, frequency of drug use, age started using methamphetamine), demographics, and socio-economic status with blood-borne viruses using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models. There were 1132 participants representing approximately 11,996,319 persons who ever used methamphetamine in the U.S. Blood-borne viruses' positive rate was 13.0 per 100,000. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed significant associations of blood-borne infections with age 40-49 years (vs. age 20-29 years, adjusted odds ratio 4.77, 95% CI 1.11-20.55), age 50-59 years (vs. age 20-29 years, 10.25, 2.40-43.82), living within poverty index 1-1.9 (vs. poverty index &gt; = 2, 2.55; 1.19-5.49), living below the poverty threshold (vs. poverty index &gt; = 2, 2.55; 1.11-5.86), having lower than high school education (vs. equal or higher than high school education, 3.13; 1.51-6.46), sexual identity as other than heterosexual (vs. heterosexual, 5.60; 1.72-18.28), using methamphetamine and heroin and cocaine (vs. using methamphetamine alone, 4.24; 1.06-16.92), injection drug use (vs. no injection drug use, 3.15; 1.61-6.16), and started using methamphetamine at age above 25 (vs. started using methamphetamine at age between 10 and 17, 2.09; 1.01-4.35). Among people who use methamphetamine, those who use polysubstance, or who inject substances, are in urgent need for vaccination and interventions to avoid further harm from blood borne infections.","Adult;Association;Behavior;Blood;Blood-Borne Infections;Cocaine;Cohort Studies;Cross-Sectional Studies;Death;Demography;Drug Overdose;Economic Status;Education;Female;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV-1;HIV-2;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis B;Hepatitis B virus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Heroin;Heterosexuals;Humans;Index;Infections;Injections;Laboratories;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;Needs;Nutrition Surveys;Odds Ratio;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poverty;Risk Factors;Risk-Taking;Schools;Serologic Tests;Sexual Behavior;Sexual Partners;Statistics;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Vaccination;Viruses;Young Adult","Blood-Borne Infections;Death;Drug Overdose;HIV Infections;Hepatitis B;Hepatitis C;Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",BMC Infect Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33062697,2020,Coexistence of Substance Abuse among Emergency Department Patients Presenting with Suicidal Ideation.,"Patients who are suicidal commonly seek care in the emergency department (ED). Few studies have examined the coexistence between suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and psychiatric diagnosis. This study sought to determine how often suicidal ED patients have coexisting substance abuse and psychiatric diagnosis in addition to describing the characteristics of target population. In this retrospective cohort study, chart reviews were conducted of patients over 12 with suicidal ideation who presented to an academic ED from October 2016 to March 2017. Data abstracted included gender, age, insurance, prior psychiatric diagnoses, substances abused, presence of a suicide attempt, prior suicidality, number of ED visits in the prior year, and disposition. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. There were 427 patient visits to the ED for suicidality during the study period, of which 54% were male, with a mean age of 34 years. Most patients (92%) had a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly depression (67%). More than one psychiatric diagnosis was reported in 51% of patients, while 8% had no reported underlying psychiatric diagnosis. Substance abuse was reported in 58% of patients, including marijuana (42%) and opioids (41%). Polysubstance abuse was reported in 42%. Approximately half of the patients had three or more ED visits in the previous 12 months. Most patients were insured by Medicaid (51%), while 59% were admitted for inpatient treatment. Substance abuse and psychiatric diagnosis were reported frequently among patients presenting to the ED with suicidal ideation, often involving more than one substance/diagnosis. Future studies should be aimed at evaluating the relationship between these conditions and determining how to better care for this population.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cannabis;Chart;Cohort Studies;Depression;Diagnosis;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Emergency Medical Services;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Future;Gender;Hospitalization;Humans;Inpatients;Insurance;Male;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Opioids;Patients;Population;Retrospective Studies;Review;Statistics;Substance Abuse;Substance-Related Disorders;Suicidal Ideation;Suicide;Target Population;Therapeutics;Young Adult","Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Substance Abuse;Substance-Related Disorders",Biomed Res Int,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33151291,2021,"Incidence of Drug Use-Related Endogenous Endophthalmitis Hospitalizations in the United States, 2003 to 2016.","Complications arising from the nationwide opioid epidemic led to an increase in health care use. Few studies have investigated whether this is reflected in hospital admissions for endogenous endophthalmitis. To report changing trends in epidemiology, risk factors, hospital course, and costs associated with drug use-related endogenous endophthalmitis hospitalizations in the United States from 2003 to 2016. Nationwide, retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Inpatient Sample. A total of 56 839 patients admitted with a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis were included. Data were analyzed between 2003 and 2016. Inpatient admission for endogenous endophthalmitis during the years 2003 to 2016. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried to identify all inpatient admissions with a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis in the United States between the years 2003 and 2016. Analyses were performed to identify national and regional trends in incidence and prevalence of associated infectious and noninfectious comorbidities in patients with or without a history of drug dependence or use. Median and cumulative inflation-adjusted costs for admissions were calculated. Of all patients, 55.6% were White, 13.6% were Black, and 10.6% were Hispanic. There were an estimated 56 839 endogenous endophthalmitis-related hospitalizations; 13.7% of these patients (n = 7783) had a history of drug dependence or use. The drug-using population was significantly younger (49.6 vs 57.5 years; difference, 7.9; 95% CI, 6.93-8.88; P &lt; .001) and more likely to be male (61.8% [n = 35 127] vs 49.0% [n = 21 712]; difference, 12.8%; 95% CI, 11.6%-14.0%; P &lt; .001). The incidence of endogenous endophthalmitis associated with drug dependence or use increased from 0.08 per 100 000 in 2003 to 0.32 per 100 000 population in 2016 across all 4 US geographic regions. A 4-fold increase in drug use-related endogenous endophthalmitis hospitalizations was observed in the United States from 2003 to 2016, resulting in substantial health care use burden. These findings support the hypothesis that clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for endophthalmitis when evaluating patients with intraocular inflammation in the setting of drug dependence or use.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Blacks;Child;Child, Preschool;Comorbidity;Cost;Cross-Sectional Studies;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis;Drug Dependence;Endophthalmitis;Epidemiology;Female;Health Care;Hispanics;History;Hospital Costs;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Incidence;Index;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Inflammation;Inflation, Economic;Inpatients;Male;Middle Aged;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prevalence;Report;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Time Factors;United States;Whites;Young Adult",Drug Dependence;Endophthalmitis;Inflammation;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Ophthalmol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33173710,2020,Assessing State Variation in Plastic Surgeons' Risk of Hepatitis C Exposure: Revisit in Methodology.,"As the national opioid epidemic escalates, rates of the Hepatitis C (HCV) infection have similarly risen. Surgeons exposed intraoperatively secondary to sharp instrument or needle-sticks are affected both socioeconomically and physically. Current treatment strategies involve antiretroviral agents that have not been universally available. This study evaluates the current risk of surgeon exposure to HCV. CDC data regarding state-by-state HCV diagnosis reporting were combined with the plastic surgery workforce data from the ASPS. Proxy variables for exposure risk to HCV were generated for each state and compared. West Virginia plastic surgeons were found to have a significantly elevated risk of exposure (60.0 versus 18.7, P &lt; 0.0001). Their exposure risk is a notable outlier compared with the rest of the country (Risk &gt;3 × IQR + 75th percentile). Similarly, states within the Ohio Valley were found to be at increased risk (34.8 versus 16.0, P = 0.05). States most heavily burdened by the opioid crisis were found to be at an increased risk for HCV exposure (40.8 versus 13.6, P = 0.0003). Plastic surgeons employed in states within the Ohio Valley were found to be at an increased risk of exposure to HCV. Plastic surgeons operating in states severely impacted by the opioid crisis were found to be at an increased risk of exposure. These findings underscore the importance of reducing the risk in the operating room and the need for better data collection to better understand this association and mitigate the risk to the operating surgeon.","Anti-Retroviral Agents;Association;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Data Collection;Diagnosis;Hepatitis C;Infections;Needlestick Injuries;Needs;Ohio;Operating Rooms;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Plastics;Proxy;Rest;Risk;Surgeons;Surgery, Plastic;Therapeutics;West Virginia;Workforce",Hepatitis C;Infections;Needlestick Injuries,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33192975,2020,"Sex, Drugs, and TBI: The Role of Sex in Substance Abuse Related to Traumatic Brain Injuries.","Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a significant public health problem costing billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost productivity while simultaneously reducing the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Substance abuse is closely interconnected with TBI, as intoxicated individuals are at a greater risk of suffering brain injuries, and TBI may serve as a risk factor for the subsequent development of substance use disorders. There are also prominent sex differences in the etiology, epidemiology, and consequences of TBI. For instance, men are more likely to be injured on sporting fields or in auto accidents, while women are disproportionately likely to suffer TBI associated with intimate partner violence. Moreover, while men are much more likely to suffer TBI during late adolescence-young adulthood, sex differences in the incidence of TBI are much less prominent during other developmental epochs. Further, there are prominent sex differences in substance abuse biology; for example, while more men meet diagnostic criteria for substance abuse disorders, women tend to advance from casual use to addiction more quickly. In this paper, we will discuss the emerging clinical and preclinical evidence that these sex differences in TBI and substance abuse interact and may be prominent determinates of long-term outcomes.","Accidents;Adolescence;Adolescent;Biology;Brain Injuries;Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Caregivers;Epidemiology;Health Care Costs;Incidence;Intimate Partner Violence;Men;Paper;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Productivity;Public Health;Quality of Life;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Women","Brain Injuries;Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders",Front Neurol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33208521,2021,Perioperative cannabis use: a longitudinal study of associated clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes.,"Despite increases in cannabis use generally and for pain management, data regarding cannabis use in patients undergoing surgery are lacking. This study examined the prevalence of cannabis use among patients undergoing elective surgery and explored differences in clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes between cannabis users and non-cannabis users. This prospective study included 1335 adults undergoing elective surgery. Participants completed self-report questionnaires preoperative and at 3-month and 6-month postsurgery to assess clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes. Overall, 5.9% (n=79) of patients reported cannabis use (53.2% medical, 19.0% recreational and 25.3% medical and recreational). On the day of surgery, cannabis users reported worse pain, more centralized pain symptoms, greater functional impairment, higher fatigue, greater sleep disturbances and more symptoms of anxiety and depression versus non-cannabis users (all p&lt;0.01). Additionally, a larger proportion of cannabis users reported opioid (27.9%) and benzodiazepine use (19.0%) compared with non-cannabis users (17.5% and 9.2%, respectively). At 3 and 6 months, cannabis users continued to report worse clinical symptoms; however, both groups showed improvement across most domains (p≤0.05). At 6 months, the groups did not differ on surgical outcomes, including surgical site pain (p=0.93) or treatment efficacy (p=0.88). Cannabis use is relatively low in this surgical population, yet cannabis users have higher clinical pain, poorer scores on quality of life indicators, and higher opioid use before and after surgery. Cannabis users reported similar surgical outcomes, suggesting that cannabis use did not impede recovery.",Adult;Anxiety;Benzodiazepine;Cannabis;Depression;Fatigue;General Surgery;Humans;Indicators;Longitudinal Studies;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Population;Prevalence;Prospective Studies;Quality of Life;Questionnaires;Report;Self Report;Sleep;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Outcome,Fatigue;Pain,Reg Anesth Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33215555,2021,Gender differences in the associations of early onset poly tobacco and drug use prior to age 18 with the prevalence of adult bronchitis in the United States.,"We investigated the associations of early onset polysubstance use prior to age 18 with the prevalence of bronchitis among U.S. adults and tested whether the associations differ by gender. A total of 77,950 adults, of them 2,653 with bronchitis in the past year, were from the combined 2013 and 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data. The variable cluster analysis was used to classify nine variables about substance use prior to age 18 (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, ecstasy, and phencyclidine). Weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLR) was used to examine the associations with bronchitis. Nine variables were divided into two clusters: early onset poly tobacco use (three tobacco use variables) and early onset poly drug use (six drug use variables). The overall prevalence of bronchitis was 3.8% (5.1% for females and 2.3% for males). MLR analysis showed that being female, elderly (ages 65 and above), obese, and early onset poly tobacco use were associated with increased odds of bronchitis (p &lt; 0.05). Gender-stratified analyses showed that early-onset poly tobacco use was significantly associated with bronchitis only in males, whereas early onset poly drug use was associated with bronchitis only in females. Moreover, obesity and tobacco use in the past year revealed associations with bronchitis regardless of gender. Obesity, early onset poly tobacco use prior to age 18, and tobacco use in the past year were positively associated with bronchitis; furthermore, the associations of early onset polysubstance use with bronchitis differed by gender, which indicated that gender differences should be considered in developing effective prevention strategies.","Adult;Age of Onset;Aged;Association;Bronchitis;Cannabis;Cigarettes;Cigars;Cluster Analysis;Cocaine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Gender;Health;Health Surveys;Heroin;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Obesity;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phencyclidine;Prevalence;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Smoking;Substance Use;Surveys;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Tobacco, Smokeless;United States",Bronchitis;Obesity;Substance Use,J Addict Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33219158,2021,Review of Palliative 223Ra in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Experience at West Virginia University Cancer Center.,"The ALSYMPCA trial of the α-emitter 223Ra in symptomatic bone-predominant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) reported a median overall survival (OS) of 14.9 mo, versus 11.3 mo for placebo. However, subsequently reported real-world experience with 223Ra in smaller mCRPC patient cohorts has appeared less successful. We performed a retrospective observational study to review our own 223Ra experience at West Virginia University (WVU). Methods: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed in all bone-predominant mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra at WVU from 2014 to 2019. The number of bone metastases per patient at the start of treatment with 223Ra was quantified via nuclear bone scans (12 scans, 5 of which also included SPECT/CT), body CT scans (8 scans), and PET/CT scans (4 scans). Standard descriptive statistics were used to study institutional review board-exempted, deidentified patient data. Median survival in ALSYMPCA and WVU patients was compared using a 2-sided, 1-sample log-rank test based on the exponential distributions. The primary endpoint was patient OS after initiating 223Ra. Results: Twenty-four patients received 98 infusions of 223Ra; 83% of these patients were referred from outside WVU. Before the first infusion, all 24 had received androgen deprivation therapy. In total, 73 sequential combinations of androgen deprivation therapy were used, 68 of which (93%) preceded the first 223Ra infusion. Also, before 223Ra, 19 (79%) patients had received docetaxel and 19 (79%) had received 33 courses of radiation, 24 of which targeted nonprostatic sites. Eleven patients (46%) completed all 6 planned 223Ra infusions; 13 (54%) stopped early because of clinical deterioration. As of August 2020, only 1 patient remained alive after completing 6 cycles of 223Ra. Median OS from the first 223Ra infusion to the last follow-up or death was 8.3 mo (range, 0-44 mo)-nearly 50% less than the ALSYMPCA median survival of 14.9 mo (P = 0.01). Compared with ALSYMPCA, more WVU patients received bisphosphonates and docetaxel, more had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of at least 2, more used opiates for pain, more had a greater bone metastasis burden by imaging, and more had lower hemoglobin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and prostate-specific antigen levels. Conclusion: Although the science supporting the development and clinical use of 223Ra is compelling, optimal clinical benefit will likely require earlier referral for 223Ra, before patients have exhausted most conventional therapies. At WVU, we found that practically all our referred patients had androgen deprivation therapy, radiation, and cytotoxic therapy before starting 223Ra. We continue to offer 223Ra therapy to patients with symptomatic bone-predominant mCRPC but are encouraging earlier patient referral.","Albumins;Alkaline Phosphatase;Androgen Antagonists;Androgens;Bone Neoplasms;Bones;Cancer;Castration;Clinical Deterioration;Death;Demography;Diphosphonates;Docetaxel;Ethics Committees, Research;Hemoglobins;Humans;Laboratories;Male;Methods;Neoplasm Metastasis;Observational Study;Opiate Alkaloids;Overall;Pain;Patients;Placebos;Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography;Prostate Cancer;Prostate-Specific Antigen;Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant;Radiation;Radiotherapy;Radium;Referral;Review;Science;Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography;Standards;Statistics;Survival;Therapeutics;Universities;West Virginia","Bone Neoplasms;Cancer;Clinical Deterioration;Death;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pain;Prostate Cancer;Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant",J Nucl Med Technol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33222180,2021,FANCD2 and HES1 suppress inflammation-induced PPARɣ to prevent haematopoietic stem cell exhaustion.,"The Fanconi anaemia protein FANCD2 suppresses PPARƔ to maintain haematopoietic stem cell's (HSC) function; however, the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that FANCD2 acts in concert with the Notch target HES1 to suppress inflammation-induced PPARƔ in HSC maintenance. Loss of HES1 exacerbates FANCD2-KO HSC defects. However, deletion of HES1 does not cause more severe inflammation-mediated HSC defects in FANCD2-KO mice, indicating that both FANCD2 and HES1 are required for limiting detrimental effects of inflammation on HSCs. Further analysis shows that both FANCD2 and HES1 are required for transcriptional repression of inflammation-activated PPARg promoter. Inflammation orchestrates an overlapping transcriptional programme in HSPCs deficient for FANCD2 and HES1, featuring upregulation of genes in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation. Loss of FANCD2 or HES1 augments both basal and inflammation-primed FAO. Targeted inhibition of PPARƔ or the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) reduces FAO and ameliorates HSC defects in inflammation-primed HSPCs deleted for FANCD2 or HES1 or both. Finally, depletion of PPARg or CPT1 restores quiescence in these mutant HSCs under inflammatory stress. Our results suggest that this novel FANCD2/HES1/PPARƔ axis may constitute a key component of immunometabolic regulation, connecting inflammation, cellular metabolism and HSC function.","Animals;Bone Marrow;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase;Cells, Cultured;Cellular Senescence;Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein;Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins;Fatty Acids;Gene Deletion;Genes;Hematopoietic Stem Cells;Inflammation;Maintenance;Metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission;Oxidative Phosphorylation;PPAR gamma;Program;Regulation;Stem Cells;Transcription Factor HES-1;Transplants;Up-Regulation",Fanconi Anemia;Inflammation,Br J Haematol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33252087,2020,"The Potential Contribution of Chronic Pain and Common Chronic Pain Conditions to Subsequent Cognitive Decline, New Onset Cognitive Impairment, and Incident Dementia: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Model for Future Research.","Growing evidence suggests that chronic pain and certain chronic pain conditions may increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia. In this systematic review, we critically evaluate available evidence regarding the association of chronic pain and specific common chronic pain conditions to subsequent decline in cognitive function, new onset cognitive impairment (CI), and incident Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); outline major gaps in the literature; and provide a preliminary conceptual model illustrating potential pathways linking pain to cognitive change. To identify qualifying studies, we searched seven scientific databases and scanned bibliographies of identified articles and relevant review papers. Sixteen studies met our inclusion criteria (2 matched case-control, 10 retrospective cohort, 2 prospective cohort), including 11 regarding the association of osteoarthritis (N = 4), fibromyalgia (N = 1), or headache/migraine (N = 6) to incident ADRD (N = 10) and/or its subtypes (N = 6), and 5 investigating the relation of chronic pain symptoms to subsequent cognitive decline (N = 2), CI (N = 1), and/or ADRD (N = 3). Studies yielded consistent evidence for a positive association of osteoarthritis and migraines/headaches to incident ADRD; however, findings regarding dementia subtypes were mixed. Emerging evidence also suggests chronic pain symptoms may accelerate cognitive decline and increase risk for memory impairment and ADRD, although findings and measures varied considerably across studies. While existing studies support a link between chronic pain and ADRD risk, conclusions are limited by substantial study heterogeneity, limited investigation of certain pain conditions, and methodological and other concerns characterizing most investigations to date. Additional rigorous, long-term prospective studies are needed to elucidate the effects of chronic pain and specific chronic pain conditions on cognitive decline and conversion to ADRD, and to clarify the influence of potential confounding and mediating factors.",Alzheimer Disease;Association;Bibliography;Chronic Pain;Cognition;Cognitive Decline;Cognitive Dysfunction;Database;Dates;Dementia;Fibromyalgia;Future;Headache;Headache Disorders;Humans;Incidence;Literature;Measures;Mediating Factors;Memory;Migraine Disorders;News;Osteoarthritis;Outline;Pain;Paper;Prospective Studies;Research;Review;Risk;Systematic Review,Alzheimer Disease;Chronic Pain;Cognitive Decline;Cognitive Dysfunction;Dementia;Fibromyalgia;Headache;Headache Disorders;Migraine Disorders;Osteoarthritis;Pain,J Alzheimers Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

Materials &amp; methods: We compared opioid exposure in patients with well-defined severe CDI and non-severe CDI. Results: Following exclusions, 403 records were reviewed. Of this group, 128/403 (31.7%) were determined to have severe CDI by strict criteria, and 275/403 (68.3%) were found to have non-severe CDI. Full multivariate regression and reduced model of potential predictors for severe CDI showed no association with opioids prescribed.

33395597,2021,Causes of death among U.S. Veterans with a prior nonfatal opioid overdose.,"For over a decade, there has been a surge in opioid-related morbidity and mortality among Veterans. To better understand the impact of the growing epidemic, it is important to identify the cause-specific mortality rates among Veterans with a prior nonfatal opioid overdose. We followed 8370 Veterans who received medical care for a nonfatal opioid overdose between 2011 through 2015.Mortality records were linked to clinical records from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We compared the mortality rates among those with a nonfatal opioid overdose to a 5 % stratified random sample of patients accessing services during the same time period. SMRs were calculated using age-adjusted cause-specific mortality rates for the l U.S. population obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). The crude mortality for Veterans with a history of a nonfatal overdose was 370.6 per 10,000 person years. Those with a prior nonfatal overdose had a higher risk of substance-related mortality (aHR [adjusted Hazard Ratio] 5.0), including a higher risk of death from drugs (aHR 6.9) and alcohol (aHR 2.7). Similarly, cause-specific mortalities assessed between Veterans and the U.S. population, SMRs were also highest for deaths associated with substances (114.0). Veterans with a prior nonfatal overdose experienced substantially higher mortality rates compared to other Veterans or the general U.S. Causes of death related to substance use and mental health were significantly higher than other causes of death, highlighting the importance of integrated treatment and substance use services.","Administration;Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Cause of Death;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Death;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Female;History;Humans;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Records;Research;Risk;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33481403,2021,A Novel Perioperative Multidose Methadone-Based Multimodal Analgesic Strategy in Children Achieved Safe and Low Analgesic Blood Methadone Levels Enabling Opioid-Sparing Sustained Analgesia With Minimal Adverse Effects.,"Intraoperative methadone, a long-acting opioid, is increasingly used for postoperative analgesia, although the optimal methadone dosing strategy in children is still unknown. The use of a single large dose of intraoperative methadone is controversial due to inconsistent reductions in total opioid use in children and adverse effects. We recently demonstrated that small, repeated doses of methadone intraoperatively and postoperatively provided sustained analgesia and reduced opioid use without respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to characterize pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of a multiple small-dose methadone strategy. Adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for idiopathic scoliosis or pectus excavatum (PE) repair received methadone intraoperatively (0.1 mg/kg, maximum 5 mg) and postoperatively every 12 hours for 3-5 doses in a multimodal analgesic protocol. Blood samples were collected up to 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed for R-methadone and S-methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP) metabolites, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), the primary methadone-binding protein. Peak and trough concentrations of enantiomers, total methadone, and AAG levels were correlated with clinical outcomes including pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), respiratory depression, and QT interval prolongation. The study population included 38 children (10.8-17.9 years): 25 PSF and 13 PE patients. Median total methadone peak plasma concentration was 24.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 19.2-40.8) ng/mL and the median trough was 4.09 (IQR, 2.74-6.4) ng/mL. AAG concentration almost doubled at 48 hours after surgery (median = 193.9, IQR = 86.3-279.5 µg/mL) from intraoperative levels (median = 87.4, IQR = 70.6-115.8 µg/mL; P &lt; .001), and change of AAG from intraoperative period to 48 hours postoperatively correlated with R-EDDP (P &lt; .001) levels, S-EDDP (P &lt; .001) levels, and pain scores (P = .008). Median opioid usage was minimal, 0.66 (IQR, 0.59-0.75) mg/kg morphine equivalents/d. No respiratory depression (95% Wilson binomial confidence, 0-0.09) or clinically significant QT prolongation (median = 9, IQR = -10 to 28 milliseconds) occurred. PONV occurred in 12 patients and was correlated with morphine equivalent dose (P = .005). Novel multiple small perioperative methadone doses resulted in safe and lower blood methadone levels, &lt;100 ng/mL, a threshold previously associated with respiratory depression. This methadone dosing in a multimodal regimen resulted in lower blood methadone analgesia concentrations than the historically described minimum analgesic concentrations of methadone from an era before multimodal postoperative analgesia without postoperative respiratory depression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc). Larger studies are needed to further study the safety and efficacy of this methadone dosing strategy.","Adolescent;Age Factors;Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Blood;Child;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Monitoring;Female;Funnel Chest;General Surgery;Humans;Indiana;Intraoperative Period;Male;Methadone;Morphine;Opioids;Orosomucoid;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Perioperative Care;Pharmacokinetics;Plasma;Population;Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting;Predictive Value of Tests;Prospective Studies;Protein Binding;Respiratory Depression;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Safety;Scoliosis;Spinal Fusion;Treatment Outcome","Funnel Chest;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting;Respiratory Depression;Scoliosis",Anesth Analg,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33526805,2021,Diet and companionship modulate pain via a serotonergic mechanism.,"Treatment of severe chronic and acute pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) remains challenging due to the interdependence of pain and psychosocial modulation. We examined whether modulation of the descending pain pathway through an enriched diet and companionship could alleviate pain in transgenic sickle mice. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were reduced significantly with enriched diet and/or companionship. Upon withdrawal of both conditions, analgesic effects observed prior to withdrawal were diminished. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) was found to be increased in the spinal cords of mice provided both treatments. Additionally, 5-HT production improved at the rostral ventromedial medulla and 5-HT accumulated at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of sickle mice, suggesting the involvement of the descending pain pathway in the analgesic response. Modulation of 5-HT and its effect on hyperalgesia was also investigated through pharmaceutical approaches. Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, showed a similar anti-nociceptive effect as the combination of diet and companionship. Depletion of 5-HT through p-chlorophenylalanine attenuated the anti-hyperalgesic effect of enriched diet and companionship. More significantly, improved diet and companionship enhanced the efficacy of a sub-optimal dose of morphine for analgesia in sickle mice. These findings offer the potential to reduce opioid use without pharmacological interventions to develop effective pain management strategies.","Acute Pain;Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Chronic Pain;Diet;Disease Models, Animal;Duloxetine;Duloxetine Hydrochloride;Female;Fenclonine;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Interpersonal Relations;Male;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Morphine;Norepinephrine;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Production;Serotonin;Serotonin Antagonists;Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Pain",Sci Rep,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33568652,2021,Anti-inflammatory dopamine- and serotonin-based endocannabinoid epoxides reciprocally regulate cannabinoid receptors and the TRPV1 channel.,"The endocannabinoid system is a promising target to mitigate pain as the endocannabinoids are endogenous ligands of the pain-mediating receptors-cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) and TRPV1. Herein, we report on a class of lipids formed by the epoxidation of N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA) and N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (NA5HT) by epoxygenases. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are dual-functional rheostat modulators of the endocannabinoid-TRPV1 axis. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are stronger modulators of TRPV1 than either NADA or NA5HT, and epoNA5HT displays a significantly stronger inhibition on TRPV1-mediated responses in primary afferent neurons. Moreover, epoNA5HT is a full CB1 agonist. These epoxides reduce the pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and nitrous oxide and raise anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in activated microglial cells. The epoxides are spontaneously generated by activated microglia cells and their formation is potentiated in the presence of anandamide. Detailed kinetics and molecular dynamics simulation studies provide evidence for this potentiation using the epoxygenase human CYP2J2. Taken together, inflammation leads to an increase in the metabolism of NADA, NA5HT and other eCBs by epoxygenases to form the corresponding epoxides. The epoxide metabolites are bioactive lipids that are potent, multi-faceted molecules, capable of influencing the activity of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors.","Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Biomarkers;Cells;Cytokines;Dopamine;Endocannabinoids;Epoxy Compounds;Female;Form;Humans;Inflammation;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-1beta;Interleukin-6;Kinetics;Lead;Ligands;Lipids;Male;Mediating;Metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Neurons, Afferent;Nitrous Oxide;Pain;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2;Receptors, Cannabinoid;Report;Serotonin;TRPV Cation Channels;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Inflammation;Pain,Nat Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

33681743,2021,"Fatal self-injury in the United States, 1999-2018: Unmasking a national mental health crisis.","Suicides by any method, plus 'nonsuicide' fatalities from drug self-intoxication (estimated from selected forensically undetermined and 'accidental' deaths), together represent self-injury mortality (SIM)-fatalities due to mental disorders or distress. SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths. We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999-2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification. For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends; Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence; and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the 'nonsuicide' SIM component. The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.4%; p&lt;0.001) versus 1.8% (95% CI: 1.6%, 2.0%; p&lt;0.001) for the suicide rate. By 2017/2018, all states except Nebraska (19.9) posted a SIM rate of at least 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population-the floor of the rate range for the top 5 ranking states in 1999/2000. The rank-order correlation coefficient for SIM and suicide rates was 0.82 (p&lt;0.001) in 1999/2000 versus 0.34 (p = 0.02) by 2017/2018. Seven states in the West posted a ≥ 5.0% reduction in their standardised mortality ratios of 'nonsuicide' drug fatalities, relative to the national ratio, and 6 states from the other 3 major regions a &gt;6.0% increase (p&lt;0.05). Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis. Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations. Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches. Injury surveillance and prevention, mental health, and societal well-being are poorly served by the continuing segregation of substance use disorders from other mental disorders in clinical medicine and public health practice.

33686881,2021,Using a machine learning approach to investigate factors associated with treatment-resistant depression among adults with chronic non-cancer pain conditions and major depressive disorder.,"Presence of chronic non-cancer pain conditions (CNPC) among adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) may reduce benefits of antidepressant therapy, thereby increasing the possibility of treatment resistance. This study sought to investigate factors associated with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) among adults with MDD and CNPC using machine learning approaches. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using a US claims database which included adults with newly diagnosed MDD and CNPC (January 2007-June 2017). TRD was identified using a clinical staging algorithm for claims data. Random forest (RF), a machine learning method, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with TRD. Initial model development included 42 known and/or probable factors that may be associated with TRD. The final refined model included 20 factors. Included in the sample were 23,645 patients (73% female mean age: 55 years; 78% with ≥2 CNPC, and 91% with joint pain/arthritis). Overall, 11.4% adults (N = 2684) met selected criteria for TRD. The five leading factors associated with TRD were the following: mental health specialist visits, polypharmacy (≥5 medications), psychotherapy use, anxiety, and age. Cross-validated logistic regression model indicated that those with TRD were younger, more likely to have anxiety, mental health specialist visits, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy use with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) ranging from 1.93 to 1.27 (all ps &lt; .001). Machine learning identified several factors that warrant further investigation and may serve as potential targets for clinical intervention to improve treatment outcomes in patients with TRD and CNPC.","Adult;Algorithms;Analgesics, Opioid;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;Arthralgia;Arthritis;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Database;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant;Female;Forests;Humans;Logistic Regression;Machine Learning;Male;Mental Health;Methods;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Overall;Patients;Polypharmacy;Psychotherapy;Retrospective Studies;Specialists;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome","Arthralgia;Arthritis;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant",Curr Med Res Opin,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33714054,2021,Drug presence in driving deaths in Maryland: Comparing trends and prevalence in medical examiner and FARS data.,"Accurate and reliable information on drug use by road users is essential to inform safety policy development but the reliability of national data has been questioned. There are two primary repositories of drug test information from fatal motor vehicle crashes in Maryland: (1) the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a national crash database managed by the US Department of Transportation, and (2) the Maryland Medical Examiner (ME). In this study, we compared drug test information for people killed in crashes in Maryland between the FARS system and ME from 2006 - 2018. As ME records are the primary source for the FARS data from Maryland, these two data sets should be closely correlated. We used probabilistic linkage to match FARS and ME cases and compared matched cases by individual drug group. Matching was achieved on 83 % of cases (N = 4803 matched pairs). ME data consistently indicated higher overall incidence and trends in the presence of depressants, narcotics, and stimulants in crash deaths. Sensitivity analysis using both strict and relaxed matching criteria did not change this result. Road safety policy and prevention efforts for crashes involving drugs and alcohol require an accurate understanding of both long-term trends and year-to-year changes in drug prevalence. These findings demonstrate the potential value of using ME data as source of drug test information for crash deaths in the United States.","Accidents, Traffic;Alcohols;Comprehension;Coroners and Medical Examiners;Database;Dataset;Death;Examiner, Medical;Humans;Incidence;Maryland;Motor Vehicles;Narcotics;Overall;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Policy Development;Prevalence;Records;Reproducibility of Results;Safety;Sensitivity;Toxicology;Transportation;United States",Death,Accid Anal Prev,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

We investigated the associations between language use and generation status with chronic pain prevalence, health insurance coverage, and analgesic medication use. We examined 3373 MA respondents from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We found higher levels of English use and generation status were associated with higher odds of reporting chronic pain. For respondents reporting chronic pain, higher levels of English use and generation status were associated with higher odds of being covered by health insurance, lower odds of having a period of time last year without health insurance, and higher odds of being prescribed any analgesic medication, especially opioid medications. We found language use and generation status play a role in MAs' experience, access, and treatment of chronic pain.

33727857,2021,Dopaminergic Regulation of Reward System Connectivity Underpins Pain and Emotional Suffering in Migraine.,"It has been suggested that reward system dysfunction may account for emotion and pain suffering in migraine. However, there is a lack of evidence whether the altered reward system connectivity is directly associated with clinical manifestations, including negative affect and ictal pain severity and, at the molecular level, the dopamine (DA) D2/D3 receptors (D2/3Rs) signaling implicated in encoding motivational and emotional cues. We acquired resting-state functional MRI from interictal episodic migraine (EM) patients and age-matched healthy controls, as well as positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride, a selective radiotracer for DA D2/3Rs, from a subset of these participants. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) was seeded to measure functional connectivity (FC) and DA D2/3Rs availability based on its essential involvement in pain-related aversive/reward functions. Associations of the brain measures with positive/negative affect and ictal pain severity were also assessed. Compared with controls, the EM group showed weaker right NAc connectivity with areas implicated in pain and emotional regulation, such as the amygdala, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus; but showed stronger left NAc connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus. Moreover, among the altered NAc connectivities, only right NAc-amygdala connectivity was inversely correlated with DA D2/3Rs availability in migraine patients (diagnostic group-by-D2/3Rs interaction p &lt; 0.007). At a clinical level, such weaker NAc-amygdala connectivity was associated with lower interictal positive affect and greater ictal pain severity over the head and facial extension area (pain area and intensity number summation, PAINS). Together, our findings suggest that altered reward system connectivity, specifically between the NAc and amygdala, might be affected by endogenous DA D2/3Rs signaling, and such process might be a neural mechanism that underlies emotional and pain suffering in episodic migraineurs.",Affect;Amygdala;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Association;Brain;Craniofacial Pain;Cues;Dopamine;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Emotional Regulation;Emotions;Head;Hippocampus;Lingual Gyrus;Measures;Migraine Disorders;Nucleus Accumbens;Pain;Patients;Pets;Positron-Emission Tomography;Raclopride;Regulation;Reward;Thalamus;fMRI,Craniofacial Pain;Migraine Disorders;Pain,J Pain Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

Advantages over other opioids include prolonged duration of action, greater potency than morphine and lack of histamine release or ceiling effect. Individual responses to oxycodone can vary due to genetic differences. This review article aims to summarize the oxycodone literature and provide context on its pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetics. The evidence for clinical effect of genetic polymorphisms on oxycodone is conflicting. There is stronger evidence linking polymorphic genetic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A with therapeutic outcomes. Further, research is needed to discern all of oxycodone's metabolites and their contribution to the overall analgesic effect.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Cancer Pain;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Enzymes;Genetics;Histamine Release;Humans;Literature;Morphine;Opioids;Overall;Oxycodone;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomics;Pharmacokinetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Receptors, Opioid;Research;Review;Therapeutics",Cancer Pain,Pharmacogenomics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

It is unknown whether epigenetic variation in OPRM1 exists within placental tissue in women with OUD and whether it is associated with NOWS outcomes. In this pilot study, the authors aimed to 1) examine the association between placental OPRM1 DNA methylation levels and NOWS outcomes, and 2) compare OPRM1 methylation levels in opioid-exposed versus non-exposed control placentas.

Placental DNA was isolated and methylation levels at six cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within the OPRM1 promoter were quantified. Methylation levels were evaluated for associations with infant NOWS outcome measures: need for pharmacologic treatment, length of hospital stay (LOS), morphine treatment days, and treatment with two medications. Regression models were created and adjusted for clinical co-variates. Methylation levels between opioid and controls placentas were also compared. The primary opioid exposures were methadone and buprenorphine. Forty-nine (76.6%) of the opioid-exposed infants required pharmacologic treatment, 10 (15.6%) two medications, and average LOS for all opioid-exposed infants was 16.5 (standard deviation 9.7) days. There were no significant associations between OPRM1 DNA methylation levels in the six CpG sites and any NOWS outcome measures. No significant differences were found in methylation levels between the opioid and control samples. No significant associations were found between OPRM1 placental DNA methylation levels and NOWS severity in this pilot cohort. In addition, no significant differences were seen in OPRM1 methylation in opioid versus control placentas. Future association studies examining methylation levels on a genome-wide level are warranted.","Association;Blood;Buprenorphine;Cytosine;DNA;DNA Methylation;Epigenetics;Future;Genes;Genome;Guanine;Hospital Stay;Infant;Methadone;Methylation;Morphine;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Phosphates;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Placenta;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Saliva;Standards;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Tissues;Women",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Syndrome,Explor Med,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33786348,2021,A Medial Congruent Polyethylene Offers Satisfactory Early Outcomes and Patient Satisfaction in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Although a successful operation, almost 20% of patients are dissatisfied with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to see if a medial congruent (MC) polyethylene would offer satisfactory early outcomes and patient satisfaction after TKA. We reviewed prospectively collected data on 327 TKAs using multiple bearings within the same implant system. Ninety-six received an MC bearing, 70 received a cruciate-retaining (CR) bearing, and 161 received a posterior-stabilized (PS) bearing. We evaluated the visual analog scale pain scores and range of motion (ROM) at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-10) score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 3 months and 1 year; and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) at 1 year. All groups had similar KOOS and PROMIS-10 scores. MC knees had lower visual analog scale scores than PS knees at all time points (P &lt; .05) and a higher ROM than PS at 2 weeks (98.6 vs 93.7, P = .002). MC knees had a significantly higher FJS-12 than CR knees (71.6 vs 58.7, P = .02). More MC knees were ""very satisfied"" than CR (92.6% vs 81.5%, P = .04). Fewer MC knees were ""not at all satisfied"" than CR (1.2% vs 9.2%, P = .04). There were similar satisfaction ratings with MC and PS. An MC bearing provided similar or improved early pain, ROM, KOOS, PROMIS-10, FJS-12, and patient satisfaction as compared with standard bearings in TKA.","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Cohort Studies;Information Systems;Joints;Knee Injuries;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Patient Reported Outcomes;Patient Satisfaction;Patients;Polyethylenes;Range of Motion, Articular;Satisfaction;Standards;Time;Visual Analog Scale",Knee Injuries;Osteoarthritis;Pain,Arthroplast Today,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33812858,2021,Mechanisms of Broad-Band UVB Irradiation‒Induced Itch in Mice.,"Although sunburn can produce severe uncontrollable itching, the underlying mechanisms of UV irradiation‒induced itch are poorly understood because of a lack of experimental animal models of sunburn itch. In this study, we established a sunburn-related mouse model and found that broad-band UVB irradiation elicited scratching but not wiping behavior in mice. Using a combination of live-cell calcium ion imaging and quantitative RT-PCR on dorsal root ganglion neurons, H&amp;E staining, immunofluorescence staining of skin preparations, and behavioral testing, in combination with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that TRPV1-positive dorsal root ganglion neurons but not mast cells are involved in broad-band UVB irradiation‒induced itch. Moreover, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 function significantly alleviated the broad-band UVB irradiation‒induced itch response. Collectively, our results suggest that broad-band UVB irradiation evokes itch sensation in mice by promoting TRPV1 channel function in dorsal root ganglion neurons and provide potential therapeutic targets for sunburn-related itch.","Animals;Behavior;Calcium;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Disease Models, Animal;Experimental Animal Models;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Genetics;Humans;Immunofluorescence;Inflammation;Ions;Male;Mast Cells;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Neurons;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Pruritus;Sensation;Skin;Staining;Sunburn;TRPV Cation Channels;Therapeutics;Ultraviolet Rays",Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Pruritus;Sunburn,J Invest Dermatol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33845073,2021,Gabapentin attenuates somatic signs of precipitated THC withdrawal in mice.,"Cannabis is the most frequently used federally illicit substance in the United States. However, there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies to mitigate the withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation in heavy users. A promising, readily available, non-cannabinoid therapy are the gabapentinoids. Although currently approved for epilepsy and neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids are increasingly used for their ""off-label"" efficacy in treating various psychiatric conditions and substance abuse. Gabapentin (GBP) synergizes with cannabinoid agonism in neuropathic pain models, substitutes for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in drug discrimination procedures, and reduced withdrawal symptoms in an outpatient clinical trial. However, there are limited data on the biological plausibility of the therapeutic action of gabapentinoids in cannabinoid withdrawal in preclinical models. The purpose of the current study was to determine the efficacy of GBP on attenuating THC withdrawal in mice, using an array of tests targeting withdrawal-induced and withdrawal-suppressed behaviors. Separate cohorts of male and female mice were administered THC (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle for 5.5 days, and withdrawal was precipitated by the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (2 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) on the sixth day. GBP (≥10 mg/kg) reduced somatic signs of withdrawal (i.e., paw tremors and head twitches), but had no effect in locomotor activity or conditioned place preference. GBP (50 mg/kg) also restored withdrawal-suppressed responding on a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule. However, GBP (50 mg/kg) had no effect in withdrawal-suppressed marble burying or tail suspension struggling and did not normalize the stress response induced by THC withdrawal, as indicated by plasma corticosterone. These data suggest gabapentin may be effective at treating cannabinoid withdrawal symptoms including somatic and affective symptoms but may act independently of endocrine stress activation.","Affective Symptoms;Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Biopharmaceuticals;Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists;Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonists;Cannabinoids;Cannabis;Clinical Trial;Corticosterone;Dronabinol;Drug Dependence;Drug Therapy;Epilepsy;Female;Gabapentin;Head;Locomotion;Male;Marble;Marijuana Abuse;Mice;Neuralgia;Outpatients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma;Procedures;Reinforcement Schedule;Rimonabant;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Tail Suspension;Therapeutics;Tremor;United States;Withdrawal Symptoms",Drug Dependence;Epilepsy;Marijuana Abuse;Neuralgia;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Tremor;Withdrawal Symptoms,Neuropharmacology,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33846141,2021,Pain Medication Disposal Rates After Pediatric Surgery.,"To investigate prescription opiate usage, disposal rates, and methods of disposal after pediatric surgery. This was a retrospective chart review of patients &lt;18 years of age who underwent a surgical procedure at our institution and were given a postoperative opiate prescription between April 2017 and June 2018. A follow-up phone survey was conducted between 60 and 90 days postoperatively to ask about prescription opiate usage and disposal. A total of 290 patients with a mean age of 9.0 ± 4.7 years (62.8% male) met inclusion criteria. Sixty patients (20.7%) reported using all of their prescription opiate medication, whereas 230 patients (79.3%) did not use all of their pain medication. Of these 230 patients, 141 (61.3%) disposed of their leftover prescription opiates via flushing (56.4%), trash (28.6%), or take-back center (15.0%). At the time of phone survey between 60 and 90 days postoperatively, 88 patients (38.3%) still had leftover pain medication. By 7 days postoperatively, 234 of 290 patients (80.7%) had taken their last prescription opioid. In our study, 79.3% of patients were overprescribed opiate pain medication after pediatric surgery. Disposal rates at 60 to 90 days for leftover pain medication after pediatric surgery was just &gt;60%. Pediatric patients are often overprescribed prescription opiates after surgery and typically only require a one-week supply of pain medication.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Back;Chart;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Flushing;General Surgery;Humans;Male;Methods;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Pediatrics;Postoperative Period;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Review;Supplies;Surgical Procedures, Operative;Surveys;Time","Flushing;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Hosp Pediatr,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33850837,2021,Are We Overradiating Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome?,"Protracted exposures to small doses of radiation, even cumulative effective doses (CED) as low as 50-100 mSv, may increase the risk for malignancy. Medical radiation exposure has not been rigorously examined for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We examined medical radiation exposure in patients with IBS at a tertiary care center in the USA. Patients diagnosed with IBS at our institute from 2009 to 2018 were included in a retrospective cohort study. Medical charts were examined to calculate total and annual CED. 221 patients were included; mean CED was 40.32 mSv (SD: 54.36). Fifty-nine participants (26.7%) received &gt;50 mSv of CED with 27 participants (12.2%) exceeding 100 mSv. Conventional imaging, nuclear medicine, and fluoroscopy accounted for 74.08, 12.93, and 12.98% of total CED, respectively. CT scans contributed to 66.61% of total CED. Outpatient orders accounted for 37.96% of total CED, while 31.4% of total CED was ordered in the emergency department. Population-specific high total CED was calculated as 105.65 mSv. Multivariable binomial logistic regression model found that comorbid anxiety, chronic pain medication use, and diarrhea-predominant IBS were independently positively associated with population-specific high CED exposure. No significant temporal trend in peri-diagnostic mean CED was found. Patients with IBS receive high amounts of medical radiation, with 1 in 4 patients reaching at-risk levels of 50 mSv or more. Usage of pain medication at home, comorbid anxiety, and IBS-D are independently linked to an increased risk of high CED.","Anxiety;Cancer;Chart;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Diagnostic Imaging;Diarrhea;Emergency Service, Hospital;Fluoroscopy;Institutes;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Logistic Regression;Nuclear Medicine;Outpatients;Pain;Patients;Population;Radiation;Radiation Exposure;Risk;Tertiary Care Centers",Cancer;Chronic Pain;Diarrhea;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Pain,Inflamm Intest Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33852365,2021,Activation of KCNQ (KV7) K+ channels in enteric neurons inhibits epithelial Cl- secretion in mouse distal colon.,"Voltage-gated Kv7 (KCNQ family) K+ channels are expressed in many neuronal populations and play an important role in regulating membrane potential by generating a hyperpolarizing K+ current and decreasing cell excitability. However, the role of KV7 channels in the neural regulation of intestinal epithelial Cl- secretion is not known. Cl- secretion in mouse distal colon was measured as a function of short-circuit current (ISC), and pharmacological approaches were used to test the hypothesis that activation of KV7 channels in enteric neurons would inhibit epithelial Cl- secretion. Flupirtine, a nonselective KV7 activator, inhibited basal Cl- secretion in mouse distal colon and abolished or attenuated the effects of drugs that target various components of enteric neurotransmission, including tetrodotoxin (NaV channel blocker), veratridine (NaV channel activator), nicotine (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist), and hexamethonium (nicotinic antagonist). In contrast, flupritine did not block the response to epithelium-targeted agents VIP (endogenous VPAC receptor ligand) or carbachol (nonselective cholinergic agonist). Flupirtine inhibited Cl- secretion in both full-thickness and seromuscular-stripped distal colon (containing the submucosal, but not myenteric plexus) but generated no response in epithelial T84 cell monolayers. KV7.2 and KV7.3 channel proteins were detected by immunofluorescence in whole mount preparations of the submucosa from mouse distal colon. ICA 110381 (KV7.2/7.3 specific activator) inhibited Cl- secretion comparably to flupirtine. We conclude that KV7 channel activators inhibit neurally driven Cl- secretion in the colonic epithelium and may therefore have therapeutic benefit in treating pathologies associated with hyperexcitable enteric nervous system, such as irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).","Aminopyridines;Animals;Bodily Secretions;Carbachol;Cell Line, Tumor;Cells;Chlorides;Cholinergic Agonists;Colon;Diarrhea;Enteric Nervous System;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Family;Female;Hexamethonium;Humans;Immunofluorescence;Intestinal Mucosa;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;KCNQ Potassium Channels;Ligands;Male;Membrane Potentials;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Myenteric Plexus;Neurons;Nicotine;Nicotinic Antagonists;Pathology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Population;Proteins;Receptors, Nicotinic;Regulation;Role;Synaptic Transmission;Tetrodotoxin;Therapeutics;Veratridine",Diarrhea;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Neoplasms,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33901729,2022,Caring for Families Impacted by Opioid Use: A Qualitative Analysis of Integrated Program Designs.,"We sought to 1) identify models of integrated care that offer medical care and social services for children and families impacted by opioid use disorder (OUD) in the postpartum year; and 2) describe how each program was developed, designed, and sustained, and explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of a dyadic, two-generation approach to care. In-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 23) were conducted with programs for women and children affected by OUD across North America. Using a phenomenologic approach, key program components and themes were identified. Following thematic saturation, these results were triangulated with experts in program implementation and with a subset of key informants to ensure data integrity. Five distinct types of programs were identified that varied in the degree of medical and behavioral care for families. Three themes emerged unique to the provision of dyadic care: 1) families require supportive, frequent visits with a range of providers, but constraints around billable services limit care integration across the perinatal continuum; 2) individual program champions are critical, but degree and reach of interdisciplinary care is limited by siloed systems for medical and behavioral care; and 3) addressing dual, sometimes competing, responsibilities for both parental and infant health following recurrence of parental substance use presents unique challenges. The key components of dyadic care models for families impacted by OUD included prioritizing care coordination, removing barriers to integrating medical and behavioral services, and ensuring the safety of children in homes with ongoing parental substance use while maintaining parental trust.","Analgesics, Opioid;Caring;Child;Family;Female;Generations;Humans;Infant;Infant Health;Interview;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;North America;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Parents;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Program;Recurrence;Safety;Social Work;Substance Use;Trust;Women",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Substance Use,Acad Pediatr,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33904144,2021,Economic Burden of Treatment-Resistant Depression among Adults with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Conditions and Major Depressive Disorder in the US.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic non-cancer pain conditions (CNPC) often co-occur and exacerbate one another. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults with CNPC can amplify the economic burden. This study examined the impact of TRD on direct total and MDD-related healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs among commercially insured patients with CNPC and MDD in the US. The retrospective longitudinal cohort study employed a claims-based algorithm to identify adults with TRD from a US claims database (January 2007 to June 2017). Costs (2018 US$) and HRU were compared between patients with and without TRD over a 12-month period after TRD/non-TRD index date. Counterfactual recycled predictions from generalized linear models were used to examine associations between TRD and annual HRU and costs. Post-regression linear decomposition identified differences in patient-level factors between TRD and non-TRD groups that contributed to the excess economic burden of TRD. Of the 21,180 adults with CNPC and MDD, 10.1% were identified as having TRD. TRD patients had significantly higher HRU, translating into higher average total costs (US$21,015TRD vs US$14,712No TRD) and MDD-related costs (US$1201TRD vs US$471No TRD) compared with non-TRD patients (all p &lt; 0.001). Prescription drug costs accounted for 37.6% and inpatient services for 30.7% of the excess total healthcare costs among TRD patients. TRD patients had a significantly higher number of inpatient (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.14-1.47) and emergency room visits (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34) than non-TRD patients. Overall, 46% of the excess total costs were explained by differences in patient-level characteristics such as polypharmacy, number of CNPC, anxiety, sleep, and substance use disorders between the TRD and non-TRD groups. TRD poses a substantial direct economic burden for adults with CNPC and MDD. Excess healthcare costs may potentially be reduced by providing timely interventions for several modifiable risk factors.","Adult;Algorithms;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Association;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Cost;Cost of Illness;Database;Dates;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant;Economics;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health Care;Health Care Costs;Humans;Incidence Rate;Index;Inpatients;Linear Models;Linear Regression;Longitudinal Studies;Overall;Patients;Polypharmacy;Prescription Drugs;Resources;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Sleep;Substance Use Disorders;Translating","Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant;Substance Use Disorders",Pharmacoeconomics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33971182,2021,Glucocorticoids and Androgens Protect From Gastric Metaplasia by Suppressing Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Activation.,"The immune compartment is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis. A weak immune response increases susceptibility to infection, but immune hyperactivation causes tissue damage, and chronic inflammation may lead to cancer development. In the stomach, inflammation damages the gastric glands and drives the development of potentially preneoplastic metaplasia. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory steroid hormones that are required to suppress gastric inflammation and metaplasia. However, these hormones function differently in males and females. Here, we investigate the impact of sex on the regulation of gastric inflammation. Endogenous glucocorticoids and male sex hormones were removed from mice using adrenalectomy and castration, respectively. Mice were treated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test the effects of androgens on regulating gastric inflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of gastric leukocytes was used to identify the leukocyte populations that were the direct targets of androgen signaling. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were depleted by treatment with CD90.2 antibodies. We show that adrenalectomized female mice develop spontaneous gastric inflammation and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) but that the stomachs of adrenalectomized male mice remain quantitatively normal. Simultaneous depletion of glucocorticoids and sex hormones abolished the male-protective effects and triggered spontaneous pathogenic gastric inflammation and SPEM. Treatment of female mice with DHT prevented gastric inflammation and SPEM development when administered concurrent with adrenalectomy and also reversed the pathology when administered after disease onset. Single-cell RNAseq of gastric leukocytes revealed that ILC2s expressed abundant levels of both the glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and androgen receptor (Ar). We demonstrated that DHT treatment potently suppressed the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines Il13 and Csf2 by ILC2s. Moreover, ILC2 depletion protected the stomach from SPEM development. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which glucocorticoids and androgens exert overlapping effects to regulate gastric inflammation. Androgen signaling within ILC2s prevents their pathogenic activation by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. This work revealed a critical role for sex hormones in regulating gastric inflammation and metaplasia.","Adrenalectomy;Androgens;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antibodies;Antispasmodics;Cancer;Castration;Cells;Cellular Microenvironment;Cytokines;Dihydrotestosterone;Disease;Disease Models, Animal;Disease Susceptibility;Drive;Female;Gastric Glands;Gastric Mucosa;Gastritis, Atrophic;Glucocorticoids;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Homeodomain Proteins;Homeostasis;Hormones;Immunity;Infections;Inflammation;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Interleukin-13;Interleukin-33;Lead;Leukocytes;Lymphocytes;Lymphoid Cells;Macrophages;Male;Metaplasia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Orchiectomy;Pathology;Polypeptides;Population;Receptors, Androgen;Receptors, Glucocorticoid;Regulation;Report;Role;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Sex;Sex Factors;Signal Transduction;Steroids;Stomach;Therapeutics;Thy-1 Antigens;Tissues;Work","Cancer;Disease Susceptibility;Gastritis, Atrophic;Infections;Inflammation;Metaplasia",Gastroenterology,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33984461,2021,Compassion Inequities and Opioid Use Disorder: A Matched Case-Control Analysis Examining Inpatient Management of Cancer-Related Pain for Patients With Opioid Use Disorder.,"The opioid epidemic spurred guidelines intended to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Although acute cancer-related pain was excluded from these recommendations, studies demonstrate reduced opioid prescribing for patients hospitalized with advanced cancer. We performed a matched case-control analysis to determine how a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) affects inpatient management of cancer pain. Charts of patients with OUD admitted for cancer pain from 2015-2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Hospitalizations were matched 1:1 by patient age and sex. Home milligram-morphine equivalent per day (MME/day) was calculated from the home medication list. Admission MME/day was the average MME/day administered during hospitalization. A total of 80 hospitalizations (40:40) were matched for 25 patients with a history of OUD and 31 patients with no history of OUD. Cancer was metastatic/relapsed for 70% of admissions. The median overall survival was 2.3 months (95% CI 0-5.21, P = 0.13). Patients with OUD had a significantly lower change from Home to Admission MME/day (-3 vs. 37, P &lt; 0.01) and were less likely to have any increase in Admission MME/day (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.43, P &lt; 0.01). When considering opioids administered after pain specialty consultation, there was no difference between groups. Our results suggest that patients with OUD receive lower quality inpatient management of cancer-related pain. Provider education and early involvement of pain specialists are crucial in delivering equitable and compassionate end-of-life care for patients with OUD.","Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chart;Compassion;Consultation;Education;Empathy;Guideline;Health;History;Hospitalization;Humans;Inappropriate Prescribing;Inpatients;Morphine;Neoplasms;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Palliative Care;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Retrospective Studies;Sex;Specialists;Survival;Terminal Care",Cancer;Cancer Pain;Death;Neoplasms;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Pain Symptom Manage,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
33990114,2021,Shedding light on pain for the clinic: a comprehensive review of using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor its process in the brain.,"Pain is a complex experience that involves sensation, emotion, and cognition. The subjectivity of the traditional pain measurement tools has expedited the interest in developing neuroimaging techniques to monitor pain objectively. Among noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has balanced spatial and temporal resolution; yet, it is portable, quiet, and cost-effective. These features enable fNIRS to image the cortical mechanisms of pain in a clinical environment. In this article, we evaluated pain neuroimaging studies that used the fNIRS technique in the past decade. Starting from the experimental design, we reviewed the regions of interest, probe localization, data processing, and primary findings of these existing fNIRS studies. We also discussed the fNIRS imaging's potential as a brain surveillance technique for pain, in combination with artificial intelligence and extended reality techniques. We concluded that fNIRS is a brain imaging technique with great potential for objective pain assessment in the clinical environment.","Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain Imaging;Cognition;Cost;Emotions;Environment;Experimental Design;Humans;Light;Neuroimaging;Pain;Pain Measurement;Review;Sensation;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34029273,2021,Quantitative Pupillometry as a Predictor of Pediatric Postoperative Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression.,"Safe postoperative pain relief with opioids is an unmet critical medical need in children. There is a lack of objective, noninvasive bedside tool to assess central nervous system (CNS) effects of intraoperative opioids. Proactive identification of children at risk for postoperative respiratory depression (RD) will help tailor analgesic therapy and significantly improve the safety of opioids in children. Quantitative pupillometry (QP) is a noninvasive, objective, and real-time tool for monitoring CNS effect-time relationship of opioids. This exploratory study aimed to determine the association of QP measures with postoperative RD, as well as to identify the best intraoperative QP measures predictive of postoperative RD in children. After approval from the institutional review board and informed parental consent, in this prospective, observational study of 220 children undergoing tonsillectomy, QP measures were collected at 5 time points: awake preoperative baseline before anesthesia induction (at the time of enrollment [T1]), immediately after anesthesia induction before morphine administration (T2), 3 minutes after intraoperative morphine administration (T3), at the end of surgery (T4), and postoperatively when awake in postanesthesia recovery unit (PACU) (T5). Intraoperative use of opioid and incidence of postoperative RD were collected. Analyses were aimed at exploring correlations of QP measures with the incidence of RD and, if found significant, to develop a predictive model for postoperative RD. Perioperative QP measures of percentage pupil constriction (CONQ, P = .027), minimum pupillary diameter (MIN, P = .027), and maximum pupillary diameter (MAX, P = .034) differed significantly among children with and without postoperative RD. A predictive model including the minimum pupillary diameter 3 minutes after morphine administration (MIN3), minimum pupillary diameter normalized to baseline (MIN31), and percentage pupillary constriction after surgery (T4) standardized to baseline (T1) (CONQ41), along with the weight-based morphine dose performed the best to predict postoperative RD in children (area under the curve [AUC], 0.76). A model based on pre- and intraoperative pupillometry measures including CONQ, MIN, along with weight-based morphine dose-predicted postoperative RD in our cohort of children undergoing tonsillectomy. More studies with a larger sample size are required to validate this finding.","Administration;Adolescent;Age Factors;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Anesthesia;Area Under Curve;Association;Central Nervous System;Child;Constriction;Ethics Committees, Research;Female;General Surgery;Humans;Incidence;Intraoperative Care;Male;Measures;Morphine;Needs;Observational Study;Opioids;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Parental Consent;Pediatrics;Point-of-Care Testing;Predictive Value of Tests;Prospective Studies;Pupil;Reflex, Pupillary;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Safety;Sample Size;Therapeutics;Time;Time Factors;Tonsillectomy;Treatment Outcome;Weights","Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency",Anesth Analg,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34065149,2021,Trichodermin Induces G0/G1 Cell Cycle Arrest by Inhibiting c-Myc in Ovarian Cancer Cells and Tumor Xenograft-Bearing Mice.,"Ovarian cancer is a fatal gynecological cancer because of a lack of early diagnosis, which often relapses as chemoresistant. Trichodermin, a trichothecene first isolated from Trichoderma viride, is an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis. However, whether trichodermin is able to suppress ovarian cancer or not was unclear. In this study, trichodermin (0.5 µM or greater) significantly decreased the proliferation of two ovarian cancer cell lines A2780/CP70 and OVCAR-3. Normal ovarian IOSE 346 cells were much less susceptible to trichodermin than the cancer cell lines. Trichodermin predominantly inhibited ovarian cancer cells by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. Trichodermin decreased the expression of cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK2, retinoblastoma protein, Cdc25A, and c-Myc but showed little effect on the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, or p16Ink4a. c-Myc was a key target of trichodermin. Trichodermin regulated the expression of Cdc25A and its downstream proteins via c-Myc. Overexpression of c-Myc attenuated trichodermin's anti-ovarian cancer activity. In addition, trichodermin decelerated tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice, proving its effectiveness in vivo. These findings suggested that trichodermin has the potential to contribute to the treatment of ovarian cancer.","Animals;Apoptosis;Biomarkers, Tumor;Cancer;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Line;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Cyclin D1;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16;Cyclin-Dependent Kinases;Disease Models, Animal;Early Diagnosis;Female;G1 Cell Cycle Arrest;G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints;Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic;Genes, myc;Growth;Heterografts;Humans;Mice;Mice, Nude;Neoplasms;Ovarian Neoplasms;Ovary Cancer;Proteins;Relapse;Retinoblastoma Protein;Therapeutics;Trichoderma;Trichodermin;Trichothecenes;Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Cancer;Neoplasms;Ovarian Neoplasms;Ovary Cancer;Relapse;Retinoblastoma,Int J Mol Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

Results: CYP2B6 poor metabolizers (*6/*6) had &gt;twofold lower methadone metabolism compared with normal/rapid metabolizers. The incidence of PONV was 4.7× greater with CYP2B6 rs1038376 variant. AG/GG variants of rs2279343 SNP had 2.86-fold higher incidence of PONV compared with the wild variant (AA). Nominal associations between rs10500282, rs11882424, rs4803419 and pain scores were observed. Conclusion: We have described novel associations between CYP2B6 genetic variants and perioperative methadone metabolism, and associations with pain scores and PONV.","Adolescent;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Child;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6;Exhibition;Female;General Surgery;Genetics;Humans;Incidence;Male;Metabolism;Methadone;Methods;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Perioperative Care;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacokinetics;Plasma;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting;Prospective Studies;Single-Blind Method;Treatment Outcome","Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting",Pharmacogenomics,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34124532,2018,Increased Healthcare Utilization and Expenditures Associated With Chronic Opioid Therapy.,"To assess the association of the transition from incident opioid use to incident chronic opioid therapy (COT) with the trajectories of healthcare utilization and expenditures. We used a longitudinal, retrospective cohort design, including seven 120-day time periods covering preindex (t1, t2, and t3), index (t4), and postindex (t5, t6, and t7) periods with data from adults aged 28 to 63 years at the index date, without cancer, and continuously enrolled in a primary commercial insurance plan (N = 20,201). Multivariable analyses were performed on utilization (population-averaged [PA] logistic regression), expenditures (PA generalized estimating equations), and expenditure estimates (counterfactual prediction). The data used were from a commercial claims database (10% random sample from the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims - US database) from 2006-2015. Patients on COT were more likely to use inpatient services (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21) compared with those who did not. Although expenditures peaked during the index period (t4) for all users, differences in unadjusted average 120-day expenditures between COT and non-COT users were highest in t4 for total ($4607) and inpatient ($2453) expenditures. COT users had significantly higher total (β = 0.183; P &lt;.01) and inpatient (β = 0.448; P &lt;.001) expenditures. The period after incident opioid prescription but before transition to COT is an important time for payers to intervene.",Adult;Aged;Association;Cancer;Database;Dates;Expenditures;Health Care;Index;Inpatients;Insurance;Logistic Regression;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Patients;Population;Prescriptions;Therapeutics;Time,Cancer,Am J Accountable Care,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34144559,2021,Trauma and nontrauma damage-control laparotomy: The difference is delirium (data from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma SLEEP-TIME multicenter trial).,"Damage-control laparotomy (DCL) has been used for traumatic and nontraumatic indications. We studied factors associated with delirium and outcome in this population. We reviewed DCL patients at 15 centers for 2 years, including demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), diagnosis, operations, and outcomes. We compared 30-day mortality; renal failure requiring dialysis; number of takebacks; hospital, ventilator, and intensive care unit (ICU) days; and delirium-free and coma-free proportion of the first 30 ICU days (DF/CF-ICU-30) between trauma (T) and nontrauma (NT) patients. We performed linear regression for DF/CF-ICU-30, including age, sex, CCI, achievement of primary fascial closure (PFC), small and large bowel resection, bowel discontinuity, abdominal vascular procedures, and trauma as covariates. We performed one-way analysis of variance for DF/CF-ICU-30 against traumatic brain injury severity as measured by Abbreviated Injury Scale for the head. Among 554 DCL patients (25.8% NT), NT patients were older (58.9 ± 15.8 vs. 39.7 ± 17.0 years, p &lt; 0.001), more female (45.5% vs. 22.1%, p &lt; 0.001), and had higher CCI (4.7 ± 3.3 vs. 1.1 ± 2.2, p &lt; 0.001). The number of takebacks (1.7 ± 2.6 vs. 1.5 ± 1.2), time to first takeback (32.0 hours), duration of bowel discontinuity (47.0 hours), and time to PFC were similar (63.2 hours, achieved in 73.5%). Nontrauma and T patients had similar ventilator, ICU, and hospital days and mortality (31.0% NT, 29.8% T). Nontrauma patients had higher rates of renal failure requiring dialysis (36.6% vs. 14.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and postoperative abdominal sepsis (40.1% vs. 17.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Trauma and NT patients had similar number of hours of sedative (89.9 vs. 65.5 hours, p = 0.064) and opioid infusions (106.9 vs. 96.7 hours, p = 0.514), but T had lower DF/CF-ICU-30 (51.1% vs. 73.7%, p = 0.029), indicating more delirium. Linear regression analysis indicated that T was associated with a 32.1% decrease (95% CI, 14.6%-49.5%; p &lt; 0.001) in DF/CF-ICU-30, while achieving PFC was associated with a 25.1% increase (95% CI, 10.2%-40.1%; p = 0.001) in DF/CFICU-30. Increasing Abbreviated Injury Scale for the head was associated with decreased DF/CF-ICU-30 by analysis of variance (p &lt; 0.001). Nontrauma patients had higher incidence of postoperative abdominal sepsis and need for dialysis, while T was independently associated with increased delirium, perhaps because of traumatic brain injury.

34144565,2021,Effect of injury location and severity on opioid use after trauma.,"Recent data have suggested that persistent opioid use is prevalent following trauma. The effect of type of injury and total injury burden is not known. We sought to characterize the relationship between injury location and severity and risk of persistent opioid use. We investigated postdischarge opioid utilization among patients who were admitted for trauma between January 2010 and June 2017 using the Optum Clinformatics Database. New persistent opioid use (NPOU) was defined as one of the following scenarios: (1) two separate opioid prescription fills between 0 and 14 days postdischarge and having 1+ fills in the 91 to 180 days following discharge or (2) filling a prescription in the 15 to 90 days following discharge in addition to a filling in the 91 to 180 day postdischarge period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between injury type and severity with new persistent opioid use development. A total of 26,437 opioid-naive patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 2,277 patients (8.6%) met the criteria for NPOU. After adjustment for confounding, NPOU was significantly more common for patients with injury to the extremities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-1.94) or abdomen (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22-1.64). Importantly, patients with maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale score of ≥2 for any body region had 1.49-fold odds of NPOU compared with patients with score of 1 (95% CI, 1.28-1.73), while no difference was seen across groupings of total injury burden based on Injury Severity Score. New persistent opioid use is common among patients suffering from trauma. In addition, patients suffering from extremity and abdominal injuries are at highest risk. Maximum individual region injury severity predicts development of new persistent use, whereas total injury severity does not.

34185225,2022,Psychometric examination of short forms from the University of Washington pain-related self-efficacy and concerns about pain item banks in patients with low back pain.,"This study examined the psychometric properties of custom short forms assessing pain-related self-efficacy and catastrophizing, which are important psychosocial constructs for individuals with pain conditions. Short forms were derived from the University of Washington concerns about pain (UWCAP) and pain-related self-efficacy (UWPRSE) item banks. Participants with low back pain (LBP) in a clinical trial (n = 241) examining nonpharmacologic treatments completed the 8-item UWCAP and 9-item UWPRSE and a numeric pain intensity rating, Oswestry Disability and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaires at baseline, 1-, 4- and 12-weeks after enrollment. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients estimated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. Floor and ceiling effects for the UWCAP and UWPRSE were examined. Concurrent validity was evaluated with univariate correlation coefficients and predictive validity with multivariate regression models. Participants were divided into categories of treatment responsiveness based on a single-item global rating measure, and UWPRSE and UWCAP change scores and standardized effect sizes were calculated in each category. Both short forms had good internal consistency (α = 0.89-0.90) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.77-0.85), without substantial floor or ceiling effects. As expected, the UWCAP was positively correlated, and UWPRSE negatively correlated, with concurrent measures of pain intensity, disability and fear-avoidance beliefs. The UWCAP added to the prediction model for 4-week disability outcomes (β = 0.25, p = 0.008). Responsiveness was supported by the mean change scores and effect sizes across treatment response categories. The UWCAP and UWPRSE short forms demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties, supporting future research on the role of these constructs in the management of persons with LBP.

34242945,2021,Efficacy of topical capsaicin for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in a pediatric and adult emergency department.,"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by symptoms of recurrent nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain in the setting of chronic cannabis use. Symptoms of CHS are frequently unresponsive to standard antiemetic therapy. Topical capsaicin applied to the abdomen has been cited as a potential effective agent for CHS however robust evidence is lacking. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of topical capsaicin in pediatric and adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected or confirmed CHS. The primary outcome assessed was if utilization of capsaicin for CHS resulted in more patients achieving an ""efficacious"" result, defined as only requiring ≤1 rescue medication for symptom relief after receiving capsaicin or after administration of the first agent in patients who did not receive capsaicin during their ED course. Secondary outcomes included total ED length of stay, time to discharge after administration of the reference agent (RA), proportion of patients requiring admission, total number of medication doses given for symptom relief, change in pain score and episodes of emesis, and proportion of patients returning to the ED within 24 h for the same complaint. Additional analyses were also performed to explore patient characteristics that may be predictive of capsaicin efficacy. 201 patients were included in the final analysis of which 25 were &lt;21 years old and seen in the pediatric ED. A greater proportion of patients in the capsaicin group achieved the primary outcome of efficacy as compared to patients who did not receive capsaicin (55% vs 21%, p &lt; 0.001, unadjusted OR 1.44 [95% CI 0.586-0.820]). There were no differences in secondary outcomes except for time to discharge after administration of the RA which was shorter in the capsaicin group (3.72 vs 6.11 h, p = 0.001). Significantly more patients in the capsaicin group experienced efficacy compared to patients who did not. Time to discharge after administration of the reference agent was shorter for those who received capsaicin compared to patients who did not. Administration of capsaicin did not influence patients' total number of medications received or total ED length of stay. Future research is needed to determine capsaicin's efficacy when utilized earlier in therapy, ideally upon initial diagnosis of CHS, and before additional adjunct medications are administered.","Abdomen;Abdominal Pain;Administration;Administration, Topical;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antiemetics;Cannabinoids;Cannabis;Capsaicin;Chi-Square Distribution;Cohort Studies;Diagnosis;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Future;Humans;Length of Stay;Male;Middle Aged;Nausea;Pain;Patients;Pediatrics;Research;Standards;Statistics, Nonparametric;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;Vomiting",Abdominal Pain;Nausea;Pain;Syndrome;Vomiting,Am J Emerg Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34285152,2022,Opioid-related risk perceptions in chronic pain: influence of patient gender and previous misuse behaviors.,"Little is known about the factors that influence providers' perceptions of patient risk for aberrant opioid use. Patient gender may interact with previous opioid misuse to influence these perceptions. We asked 131 physicians to view videos and vignettes for 8 virtual patients with chronic pain. Gender (male/female) and previous prescription opioid misuse (present/absent) varied across patients; the vignettes were otherwise balanced on demographic and clinical characteristics. For each patient, providers assessed 4 risk domains: opioid-related adverse events, opioid misuse or abuse, opioid addiction, and opioid diversion. Results indicated a significant gender-by-misuse interaction for risk of opioid misuse orabuse. When previous misuse behaviors were absent, providers rated men at higher risk; there was no gender difference when previous misuse behaviors were present. A significant gender-by-misuse interaction was found for risk of opioid-related adverse events. Providers perceived men to be at higher risk when previous misuse behaviors were absent; there was no gender difference when previous misuse behaviors were present. A significant gender-by-misuse interaction was found for risk of opioid addiction. Providers rated women at higher risk when previous misuse behaviors were present and men at higher risk when previous misuse behaviors were absent. There were significant main effects of gender and misuse for risk of opioid diversion. Providers rated men and those with previous misuse behaviors at higher risk. These results demonstrate that patient gender and previous opioid misuse have unique and interactive effects on provider perceptions of prescription opioid-related risks. Studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying these effects, such as gender-based stereotypes about risk-taking and drug abuse.","Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Demography;Drug Abuse;Female;Gender;Humans;Male;Men;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Perception;Physicians;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Risk;Risk-Taking;Sex Characteristics;Women",Chronic Pain;Drug Abuse;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34309138,2021,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signal Variability Is Associated With Neuromodulation in Fibromyalgia.,"Although primary motor cortex (M1) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has an analgesic effect in fibromyalgia (FM), its neural mechanism remains elusive. We investigated whether M1-tDCS modulates a regional temporal variability of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, an indicator of the brain's flexibility and efficiency and if this change is associated with pain improvement. In a within-subjects cross-over design, 12 female FM patients underwent sham and active tDCS on five consecutive days, respectively. Each session was performed with an anode placed on the left M1 and a cathode on the contralateral supraorbital region. The subjects also participated in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and after sham and active tDCS. We compared the BOLD signal variability (SDBOLD ), defined as the standard deviation of the BOLD time-series, between the tDCS conditions. Baseline SDBOLD was compared to 15 healthy female controls. At baseline, FM patients showed reduced SDBOLD in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), lateral PFC, and anterior insula and increased SDBOLD in the posterior insula compared to healthy controls. After active tDCS, compared to sham, we found an increased SDBOLD in the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), lateral PFC, and thalamus. After sham tDCS, compared to baseline, we found a decreased SDBOLD in the dorsomedial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Interestingly, after active tDCS compared to sham, pain reduction was correlated with an increased SDBOLD in the rACC/vmPFC but with a decreased SDBOLD in the posterior insula. Our findings suggest that M1-tDCS might revert temporal variability of fMRI signals in the rACC/vmPFC and posterior insula linked to FM pain. Changes in neural variability would be part of the mechanisms underlying repetitive M1-tDCS analgesia in FM.",Analgesia;Analgesics;Anode;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Blood;Brain;Cathode;Cross-Over Design;Efficiency;Female;Fibromyalgia;Indicators;Pain;Patients;Pliability;Posterior Cingulate Cortex;Precuneus Cortex;Primary Motor Cortex;Standards;Thalamus;Time;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation;Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex;fMRI,Fibromyalgia;Pain,Neuromodulation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34326146,2021,Intercellular Arc Signaling Regulates Vasodilation.,"Injury responses require communication between different cell types in the skin. Sensory neurons contribute to inflammation and can secrete signaling molecules that affect non-neuronal cells. Despite the pervasive role of translational regulation in nociception, the contribution of activity-dependent protein synthesis to inflammation is not well understood. To address this problem, we examined the landscape of nascent translation in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified the activity-dependent gene, Arc, as a target of translation in vitro and in vivo Inflammatory cues promote local translation of Arc in the skin. Arc-deficient male mice display exaggerated paw temperatures and vasodilation in response to an inflammatory challenge. Since Arc has recently been shown to be released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we hypothesized that intercellular Arc signaling regulates the inflammatory response in skin. We found that the excessive thermal responses and vasodilation observed in Arc defective mice are rescued by injection of Arc-containing EVs into the skin. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent production of Arc in afferent fibers regulates neurogenic inflammation potentially through intercellular signaling.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Nociceptors play prominent roles in pain and inflammation. We examined rapid changes in the landscape of nascent translation in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) treated with a combination of inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified several hundred transcripts subject to rapid preferential translation. Among them is the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc. We provide evidence that Arc is translated in afferent fibers in the skin. Arc-deficient mice display several signs of exaggerated inflammation which is normalized on injection of Arc containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our work suggests that noxious cues can trigger Arc production by nociceptors which in turn constrains neurogenic inflammation in the skin.","AIDS-Related Complex;Address;Affect;Animals;Cells;Communication;Cues;Cytoskeletal Proteins;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Extracellular Vesicles;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Genes, Immediate-Early;In Vitro;Inflammation;Injections;Injuries;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Play;Production;Proteins;Regulation;Ribosomes;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Skin;Temperature;Translations;Vasodilation;Work",AIDS-Related Complex;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Injuries;Neurogenic Inflammation;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34334685,2022,Preconception Substance Use and Risk of Unintended Pregnancy: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2016-17.,"This study examined the association between preconception substance use and unintended pregnancy in a large, nationally representative sample of women. In this cross-sectional study, we used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) comprising, 74,543women who had birth during 2016-17. Logistic regression was used to assess the independent association of unintended pregnancy overall and by subtypes to preconception substance use (smoking and other nicotine/tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and use of cannabis, illicit/recreational drugs) and specific medication including prescription opioids, antidepressants and over the counter pain relief. Overall, 41% of pregnancies were unintended. Nearly 57% of participants reported alcohol consumption during the preconception period, with 32% indicating binge drinking, 17% reported preconception smoking, and 10% cannabis use. Unintended pregnancy was significantly associated with substance use, including smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-1.6); as well as the use of other nicotine/tobacco (AOR:1.4, 95% CI: 1.3-1.5); cannabis (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5-2.3); illicit/recreational drugs (AOR:1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4), prescription opioids (AOR:1.4, 95% CI: 1.02-1.9), and prescription antidepressants (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.0). The likelihood of unintended pregnancy was significantly elevated with heavy smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and binge drinking. Analyses by unintended pregnancy subtype yielded similar results. Preconception substance use was significantly and positively associated with unintended pregnancy. Evidence-based interventions are needed addressing substance use behavior and effective contraceptive use to prevent unintended pregnancy and related adverse effects on maternal and child health.","Alcohol Drinking;Analgesics, Opioid;Antidepressive Agents;Association;Behavior;Binge Drinking;Cannabis;Child;Child Health;Confidence Intervals;Contraceptive Agents;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Logistic Regression;Nicotine;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Parturition;Pregnancy;Pregnancy, Unplanned;Prescriptions;Recreational Drugs;Risk;Risk Assessment;Smoking;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Women",Binge Drinking;Pain;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34351824,2022,Increased Odds of Incident Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Presence of Common Non-Cancer Chronic Pain Conditions in Appalachian Older Adults.,"There is a growing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of common non-cancer chronic pain conditions (NCPCs) and their possible association with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, large population-based studies are limited, especially in Appalachian and other predominantly rural, underserved populations who suffer elevated prevalence of both NCPCs and known ADRD risk factors. We investigated the relation of NCPC to risk of incident ADRD in older Appalachian Medicare beneficiaries and explored the potential mediating effects of mood and sleep disorders. Using a retrospective cohort design, we assessed the overall and cumulative association of common diagnosed NCPCs at baseline to incident ADRD in 161,573 elders ≥65 years, Medicare fee-for-service enrollees, 2013-2015. NCPCs and ADRD were ascertained using claims data. Additional competing risk for death analyses accounted for potential survival bias. Presence of any NCPC at baseline was associated with significantly increased odds for incident ADRD after adjustment for covariates [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.26 (1.20, 1.32), p &lt; .0001]. The magnitude and strength of this association increased significantly with rising burden of NCPCs at baseline [AOR for ≥4 vs. no NCPC = 1.65 (1.34, 2.03), p-trend = .01]. The addition of depression and anxiety, but not sleep disorders, modestly attenuated these associations [AORs for any NCPC and ≥4 NCPCs, respectively = 1.16 (1.10, 1.22) and 1.39 (1.13, 1.71)], suggesting a partial mediating role of mood impairment. Sensitivity analyses, multinomial logistic regressions accounting for risk of death, yielded comparable findings. In this large cohort of older Appalachian Medicare beneficiaries, baseline NCPCs showed a strong, positive, dose-response relationship to odds for incident ADRD; this association appeared partially mediated by depression and anxiety. Further longitudinal research in this and other high-risk, rural populations are needed to evaluate the causal relation between NCPC and ADRD.","Accounting;Adjustment;Adult;Aged;Alzheimer Disease;Anxiety;Appalachian Region;Association;Bias;Cancer;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Death;Dementia;Depression;Fee-for-Service Plans;Humans;Logistic Regression;Mediating;Medicare;Mood;Neoplasms;Odds Ratio;Overall;Population;Populations, Underserved;Prevalence;Research;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Rural Population;Sensitivity;Sleep Disorders;Survival;United States;West Virginia",Alzheimer Disease;Cancer;Chronic Pain;Death;Dementia;Neoplasms;Sleep Disorders,J Aging Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34375675,2021,Circadian rhythms and pain.,"The goal of this review is to provide a perspective on the nature and importance of the relationship between the circadian and pain systems. We provide: 1) An overview of the circadian and pain systems, 2) a review of direct and correlative evidence that demonstrates diurnal and circadian rhythms within the pain system; 3) a perspective highlighting the need to consider the role of a proposed feedback loop of circadian rhythm disruption and maladaptive pain; 4) a perspective on the nature of the relationship between circadian rhythms and pain. In summary, we propose that there is no single locus responsible for producing the circadian rhythms of the pain system. Instead, circadian rhythms of pain are a complex result of the distributed rhythms present throughout the pain system, especially those of the descending pain modulatory system, and the rhythms of the systems with which it interacts, including the opioid, endocrine, and immune systems.",Chronic Pain;Circadian Rhythm;Feedback;Goals;Humans;Immune System;Nature;Needs;Opioids;Pain;Review;Role,Chronic Pain;Pain,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34429022,2021,Unhealthy Opioid Use and COVID-19 Mortality Incidence in Older Adults: A Multicenter Research Network Study.,"Opioid use has the potential to influence infectious respiratory diseases. The purpose of this research is to examine if there is an association of deaths from the respiratory infection, COVID-19, and unhealthy opioid use in older adults. Data about patients, ages ≥65 years, who had a COVID-19 infection between 1/20/2020 to 12/23/2020 (n = 533,153) were extracted using the TriNetX system. Mortality incidence between initial diagnosis and ninety days after contracting COVID-19 were determined. Comparisons were made between people with and without unhealthy opioid use. There were 7,547 COVID-19 patients with unhealthy opioid use (mean age, 71.8 years; standard deviation 6.3 years) and 525,606 COVID-19 patients (mean age, 74.1 years; standard deviation 7.3 years) without unhealthy opioid use. Of the total, 15,852 (3.0%) died within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. The unadjusted risk ratio of the cohort with unhealthy opioid use compared with the cohort that did not have unhealthy opioid uses was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05,1.33); p = 0.0069. The relationship failed to remain significant in analysis with propensity score matching (risk ratio = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.14; p = 0.6606, ns). The public health implication is that although older adults are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than younger adults, a difference between older adults with or without unhealthy opioid use did not increase vulnerability to death from COVID-19 and should be not be considered if rationing of care becomes necessary.","Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;COVID-19;COVID-19 Testing;Death;Diagnosis;Disease;Humans;Incidence;Infections;Mortality;Odds Ratio;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Propensity Score;Public Health;Research;Respiratory Tract Infections;SARS-CoV-2;Standards",COVID-19;Death;Infections;Respiratory Tract Infections,Subst Use Misuse,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34432825,2021,The gut microbiome in sickle cell disease: Characterization and potential implications.,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that leads to hemolytic anemia, pain, organ damage and early mortality. It is characterized by polymerized deoxygenated hemoglobin, rigid sickle red blood cells and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Recurrent hypoxia-reperfusion injury in the gut of SCD patients could increase tissue injury, permeability, and bacterial translocation. In this context, the gut microbiome, a major player in health and disease, might have significant impact. This study sought to characterize the gut microbiome in SCD. Stool and saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (n = 14) and SCD subjects (n = 14). Stool samples were also collected from humanized SCD murine models including Berk, Townes and corresponding control mice. Amplified 16S rDNA was used for bacterial composition analysis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Pairwise group analyses established differential bacterial groups at many taxonomy levels. Bacterial group abundance and differentials were established using DeSeq software. A major dysbiosis was observed in SCD patients. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in these patients. The following bacterial families were more abundant in SCD patients: Acetobacteraceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Candidatus Saccharibacteria, Peptostreptococcaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae, Actinomycetaceae, Clostridiales, Bacteroidacbactereae and Fusobacteriaceae.

A major dysbiosis was observed in SCD patients for bacteria that are known strong pro-inflammatory triggers.

34435753,2021,Pharmacokinetic modeling of R and S-Methadone and their metabolites to study the effects of various covariates in post-operative children.,"Methadone is a synthetic opioid used as an analgesic and for the treatment of opioid abuse disorder. The analgesic dose in the pediatric population is not well-defined. The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of methadone is highly variable due to the variability in alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) and genotypic differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes. Additionally, the R and S enantiomers of methadone have unique PK and pharmacodynamic properties. This study aims to describe the PKs of R and S methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) in pediatric surgical patients and to identify sources of inter- and intra-individual variability. Children aged 8-17.9 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries received intravenous methadone 0.1 mg/kg intra-operatively followed by oral methadone 0.1 mg/kg postoperatively every 12 h. Pharmacokinetics of R and S methadone and EDDP were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assays and the data were modeled using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling in NONMEM. R and S methadone PKs were well-described by two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and elimination. EDDP metabolites were described by one compartment disposition models with first order elimination. Clearance of both R and S methadone were allometrically scaled by bodyweight. CYP2B6 phenotype was a determinant of the clearance of both the enantiomers in an additive gene model. The intronic CYP3A4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2246709 was associated with decreased clearance of R and S methadone. Concentrations of AAG and the SNP of AAG rs17650 independently increased the volume of distribution of both the enantiomers. The knowledge of these important covariates will aid in the optimal dosing of methadone in children.","Absorption;Adolescent;Aged;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Biological Variation, Individual;Biological Variation, Population;Child;Chromatography, Liquid;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4;Enzymes;Female;Genes;Humans;Intraoperative Care;Knowledge;Male;Methadone;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Orosomucoid;Orthopedic Procedures;Orthopedic Surgery;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Pediatrics;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenomic Variants;Pharmacokinetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Population;Postoperative Care;Pyrrolidines;Stereoisomerism;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Therapeutics","Opioid Abuse;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34443380,2021,Novel Putative Positive Modulators of α4β2 nAChRs Potentiate Nicotine Reward-Related Behavior.,"The popular tobacco and e-cigarette chemical flavorant (-)-menthol acts as a nonselective, noncompetitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and contributes to multiple physiological effects that exacerbates nicotine addiction-related behavior. Menthol is classically known as a TRPM8 agonist; therefore, some have postulated that TRPM8 antagonists may be potential candidates for novel nicotine cessation pharmacotherapies. Here, we examine a novel class of TRPM8 antagonists for their ability to alter nicotine reward-related behavior in a mouse model of conditioned place preference. We found that these novel ligands enhanced nicotine reward-related behavior in a mouse model of conditioned place preference. To gain an understanding of the potential mechanism, we examined these ligands on mouse α4β2 nAChRs transiently transfected into neuroblastoma-2a cells. Using calcium flux assays, we determined that these ligands act as positive modulators (PMs) on α4β2 nAChRs. Due to α4β2 nAChRs' important role in nicotine dependence, as well as various neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, the identification of these ligands as α4β2 nAChR PMs is an important finding, and they may serve as novel molecular tools for future nAChR-related investigations.","Ability;Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Calcium;Cells;Comprehension;Drug Therapy;Electronic Cigarettes;Female;Future;Ligands;Male;Menthol;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Nervous System Diseases;Neuroblastoma;Nicotine;Nicotine Addiction;Nicotine Dependence;Parkinson Disease;Receptors, Nicotinic;Reward;Role;Time Factors;Tobacco",Nervous System Diseases;Neuroblastoma;Nicotine Addiction;Nicotine Dependence;Parkinson Disease,Molecules,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34452780,2022,Timing of smoking cessation treatment integrated into outpatient treatment with medications for opioid use disorder: Feasibility trial.,"Cigarette smoking rates among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are notoriously high and may be improved by considering the timing of treatment integration for these two substances. The current study examined the feasibility of a method for assessing the timing of integrating smoking cessation pharmacotherapy within three different phases of outpatient treatment with medication for OUD (MOUD). Seventy-four buprenorphine-maintained smokers were enrolled in a quasi-experimental study across three MOUD treatment phases: 0-90 (Phase 1), 91-365 (Phase 2), and &gt; 365 days of MOUD treatment (Phase 3). During a 12-week varenicline-based intervention, the study assessed outcomes daily via text messages (cigarette smoking, varenicline adherence, side effects) or monthly at in-person visits (quit motivation and carbon monoxide levels). Thirty-five participants completed the study, with a lower retention rate in Phase 1 (37.5%) relative to Phases 2 (53.5%) or 3 (57.1%). A trend occurred for Phase 1 participants to report aversive side effects (e.g., abnormal dreams, gastrointestinal distress) on more study days. Among completers, adherence to text messaging and varenicline use was high and independent of MOUD treatment phase. Participants in all phases reported declines in cigarette smoking and increases in quit motivation over time; the study observed biochemically verified tobacco abstinence among only a few participants from Phases 2 or 3. This feasibility study demonstrates a method to evaluate the timing of treatment integration for cigarette smoking and MOUD. Method strengths include a study schedule that coincided with the MOUD clinic schedule and use of text messaging to encourage varenicline adherence and evaluate outcomes regularly.",Buprenorphine;Carbon Monoxide;Cigarette Smoking;Cigarettes;Dreams;Drug Therapy;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Methods;Motivation;Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Outpatients;Persons;Relatives;Report;Schedules;Smokers;Smoking Cessation;Text Messages;Text Messaging;Therapeutics;Time;Tobacco;Treatment Outcome;Varenicline,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34479978,2021,Sex Differences in Behavioral and Brainstem Transcriptomic Neuroadaptations following Neonatal Opioid Exposure in Outbred Mice.,"The opioid epidemic led to an increase in the number of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) cases in infants born to opioid-dependent mothers. Hallmark features of NOWS include weight loss, severe irritability, respiratory problems, and sleep fragmentation. Mouse models provide an opportunity to identify brain mechanisms that contribute to NOWS. Neonatal outbred Swiss Webster Cartworth Farms White (CFW) mice were administered morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, an approximation of the third trimester of human gestation. Female and male mice underwent behavioral testing on P7 and P14 to determine the impact of opioid exposure on anxiety and pain sensitivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and daily body weights were also recorded. Brainstems containing pons and medulla were collected during morphine withdrawal on P14 for RNA sequencing. Morphine induced weight loss from P2 to P14, which persisted during adolescence (P21) and adulthood (P50). USVs markedly increased at P7 in females, emerging earlier than males. On P7 and P14, both morphine-exposed female and male mice displayed hyperalgesia on the hot plate and tail-flick assays, with females showing greater hyperalgesia than males. Morphine-exposed mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field arena on P21. Transcriptome analysis of the brainstem, an area implicated in opioid withdrawal and NOWS, identified pathways enriched for noradrenergic signaling in females and males. We also found sex-specific pathways related to mitochondrial function and neurodevelopment in females and circadian entrainment in males. Sex-specific transcriptomic neuroadaptations implicate unique neurobiological mechanisms underlying NOWS-like behaviors.","Adolescence;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Anxiety;Behavior;Body Weight;Brain;Brain Stem;Farms;Female;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Mice;Morphine;Mothers;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pons;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Rodentia;Sensitivity;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Sleep Fragmentation;Syndrome;Tail;Transcriptome;Ultrasonics;Weight Loss;Whites",Hyperalgesia;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Sleep Fragmentation;Syndrome;Weight Loss,eNeuro,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34581663,2021,Co-Occurring Opioid Use and Depressive Disorders: Patient Characteristics and Co-Occurring Health Conditions.,"Among persons with opioid use disorder (OUD), co-occurring depression is linked to a greater risk of opioid misuse, overdose and suicide. Less is known about characteristics and other comorbid health conditions of persons with co-occurring opioid use and depressive disorders. This study used electronic health record (EHR) encounters from the Geisinger Health System prior to the fall of 2019. Adult patients were recruited from a medication-based treatment clinic and had an OUD diagnosis (N = 692). Co-occurring depression was defined by a depression diagnosis in the EHR. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess differences in characteristics, behavioral health and medical diagnoses, as well as opioid overdose and suicide attempt or ideation between individuals with and without comorbid depression. Forty-seven percent of patients with OUD had a lifetime depression diagnosis. Individuals with co-occurring depression were more likely to be female and have comorbid chronic pain or other medical conditions. Co-occurring depression was associated with an increased likelihood of other mental health and substance use disorders, as well as opioid overdose and/or suicide attempt or ideation. While it is established that co-occurring depression is associated with increased risk of overdose and suicide, this study adds that other health conditions, including chronic pain and common medical conditions, are more prevalent among persons with co-occurring depressive disorders. Results highlight the need to consider these complex health needs when developing treatment plans and services.","Accidental Falls;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Depression;Depressive Disorder;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Mental Health;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Risk;Substance Use Disorders;Suicide;Therapeutics",Chronic Pain;Depressive Disorder;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Dual Diagn,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34629389,2022,Transmembrane protein TMEM184B is necessary for interleukin-31-induced itch.,"Nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) convey sensations of pain and itch to the spinal cord, respectively. One subtype of mature DRG neurons, comprising 6% to 8% of neurons in the ganglia, is responsible for sensing mediators of acute itch and atopic dermatitis, including the cytokine IL-31. How itch-sensitive (pruriceptive) neurons are specified is unclear. Here, we show that transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B), a protein with roles in axon degeneration and nerve terminal maintenance, is required for the expression of a large cohort of itch receptors, including those for interleukin 31 (IL-31), leukotriene C4, and histamine. Male and female mice lacking TMEM184B show reduced responses to IL-31 but maintain normal responses to pain and mechanical force, indicating a specific behavioral defect in IL-31-induced pruriception. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that a reduction in IL-31-induced calcium entry is a likely contributor to this phenotype. We identified an early failure of proper Wnt-dependent transcriptional signatures and signaling components in Tmem184b mutant mice that may explain the improper DRG neuronal subtype specification. Accordingly, lentiviral re-expression of TMEM184B in mutant embryonic neurons restores Wnt signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that TMEM184B promotes adult somatosensation through developmental Wnt signaling and promotion of proper pruriceptive gene expression. Our data illuminate a new key regulatory step in the processes controlling the establishment of diversity in the somatosensory system.","Adult;Animals;Axons;Calcium;Cytokines;Dermatitis, Atopic;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Female;Ganglia;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Histamine;Humans;Interleukins;Leukotriene C4;Maintenance;Male;Mice;Neurons;News;Pain;Phenotype;Proteins;Pruritus;Role;Sensation;Spinal Cord;Wnt Signaling","Dermatitis, Atopic;Pain;Pruritus",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34636731,2021,Brain Mechanisms of Virtual Reality Breathing Versus Traditional Mindful Breathing in Pain Modulation: Observational Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy Study.,"Pain is a complex experience that involves sensory-discriminative and cognitive-emotional neuronal processes. It has long been known across cultures that pain can be relieved by mindful breathing (MB). There is a common assumption that MB exerts its analgesic effect through interoception. Interoception refers to consciously refocusing the mind's attention to the physical sensation of internal organ function. In this study, we dissect the cortical analgesic processes by imaging the brains of healthy subjects exposed to traditional MB (TMB) and compare them with another group for which we augmented MB to an outside sensory experience via virtual reality breathing (VRB). The VRB protocol involved in-house-developed virtual reality 3D lungs that synchronized with the participants' breathing cycles in real time, providing them with an immersive visual-auditory exteroception of their breathing. We found that both breathing interventions led to a significant increase in pain thresholds after week-long practices, as measured by a thermal quantitative sensory test. However, the underlying analgesic brain mechanisms were opposite, as revealed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy data. In the TMB practice, the anterior prefrontal cortex uniquely modulated the premotor cortex. This increased its functional connection with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), thereby facilitating the S1-based sensory-interoceptive processing of breathing but inhibiting its other role in sensory-discriminative pain processing. In contrast, virtual reality induced an immersive 3D exteroception with augmented visual-auditory cortical activations, which diminished the functional connection with the S1 and consequently weakened the pain processing function of the S1. In summary, our study suggested two analgesic neuromechanisms of VRB and TMB practices-exteroception and interoception-that distinctively modulated the S1 processing of the ascending noxious inputs. This is in line with the concept of dualism (Yin and Yang).","Analgesics;Attention;Brain;Culture;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Interoception;Lung;Mobile Phone;Pain;Pain Threshold;Prefrontal Cortex;Premotor Cortex;Primary Somatosensory Cortex;Respiration;Role;Sensation;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Time;Virtual Reality",Pain,J Med Internet Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

34934004,2021,Tetramerization of STAT5 promotes autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation.,"Signal tranducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) plays a critical role in mediating cellular responses following cytokine stimulation. STAT proteins critically signal via the formation of dimers, but additionally, STAT tetramers serve key biological roles, and we previously reported their importance in T and natural killer (NK) cell biology. However, the role of STAT5 tetramerization in autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation has not been investigated. Using the STAT5 tetramer-deficient Stat5a-Stat5b N-domain double knockin (DKI) mouse strain, we report here that STAT5 tetramers promote the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The mild EAE phenotype observed in DKI mice correlates with the impaired extravasation of pathogenic T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and interactions between Th17 cells and monocyte-derived cells (MDCs) in the meninges. We further demonstrate that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-mediated STAT5 tetramerization regulates the production of CCL17 by MDCs. Importantly, CCL17 can partially restore the pathogenicity of DKI Th17 cells, and this is dependent on the activity of the integrin VLA-4. Thus, our study reveals a GM-CSF-STAT5 tetramer-CCL17 pathway in MDCs that promotes autoimmune neuroinflammation.","Animals;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;Biology;Biopharmaceuticals;Cells;Chemokine CCL17;Cytokines;Disease;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Integrin alpha4beta1;Integrins;Killer Cells, Natural;Macrophages;Mediating;Meninges;Mice;Monocytes;Pathogenicity;Phenotype;Play;Production;Protein Multimerization;Proteins;Report;Role;STAT5 Transcription Factor;Th17 Cells","Autoimmune Diseases;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
34974172,2022,"The Longitudinal Relationship Between Emotion Regulation and Pain-Related Outcomes: Results From a Large, Online Prospective Study.","People with chronic pain engage in various strategies, such as pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance, to regulate the difficult emotional aspects of living with pain. Engagement in these strategies is known to influence pain severity and pain interference. However, less research has examined the extent to which general emotion regulation, the ability to identify emotions and engage in strategies to alter emotions, relates to pain-related outcomes. The current study, a large (N = 1453) online prospective study of adults with chronic pain, employed theory-driven assessment of emotion regulation to determine the extent to which general difficulties with emotion regulation at baseline relate to pain severity and pain interference at three-month follow-up, above and beyond pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance. We conducted a series of path models, controlling for demographic covariates and baseline pain severity and pain interference. Pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance at baseline significantly predicted pain interference at three-month follow-up. However, when indices of general emotion regulation were entered into the model, the associations between pain catastrophizing and pain interference (B = .009, P = .153) were no longer statistically significant. Alexithymia emerged as a significant predictor of pain severity (B = .012, P = .032) and pain interference (B = .026, P &lt; .001). These findings highlight the value of considering the role of general emotion regulation (particularly identifying and describing emotions), in addition to pain-specific experiences, in understanding risk for poor pain-related outcomes. PERSPECTIVE: In addition to pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance, difficulties regulating emotions in general (particularly elevated alexithymia) relates to pain outcomes three months later. These findings shed light on risk for poor pain outcomes and point to general emotion regulation as a potentially important target of chronic pain intervention.",Ability;Adult;Alexithymia;Association;Catastrophization;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Demography;Emotional Regulation;Emotions;Humans;Light;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Persons;Prospective Studies;Research;Risk;Role,Chronic Pain;Pain,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35226836,2022,Sexual function after hysterectomy according to surgical indication: a prospective cohort study.,"Our aims were to describe characteristics of sexual function prior to and 6months following benign hysterectomy in patients with three common surgical indications, and to identify preoperative factors that influence the magnitude and direction of change in sexual function after the procedure. This prospective observational cohort study enrolled women (n =80) undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications. Patients were categorised into three groups according to surgical indication: (1) pelvic pain (PP), (2) abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), and (3) pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Primary outcome was Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which patients completed preoperatively and 6months postoperatively. The study included 80 patients, of whom 25.0% (n =20) had surgical indication of PP, 46.3% (n =37) of AUB, and 28.7% (n =23) of POP. PP patients experienced a significant improvement in overall sexual function, as well as orgasm and pain domains following hysterectomy. Significant improvements were not found in AUB and POP patients. In multivariate analysis, lower baseline sexual function (P &lt;0.001), younger age (P =0.013), and pelvic pain&lt;6months (P =0.020) were each independently associated with improvement in sexual function, but surgical indication was not significant. Individual patient factors including younger age, lower baseline sexual function, and short duration of pelvic pain are associated with a higher likelihood of improvement in sexual function after hysterectomy.

35272053,2022,"Trajectories and Individual Differences in Pain, Emotional Distress, and Prescription Opioid Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A One-Year Longitudinal Study.","Recent studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a unique psychosocial stressor that can negatively impact individuals with chronic pain. Using a large online sample in the U.S., the present study sought to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the trajectories of pain severity and interference, emotional distress (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), and opioid misuse behaviors across one year. Potential moderating effects of socio-demographic factors and individual differences in pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and sleep disturbance on outcome trajectories were also examined. Adults with chronic pain were surveyed three times across 1 year (April/May 2020 [N = 1,453]; June/July 2020 [N = 878], and May 2021 [N = 813]) via Amazon's Mechanical Turk online crowdsourcing platform. Mixed-effects growth models revealed that pain severity and interference, emotional distress, and opioid misuse behaviors did not significantly deteriorate across one year during the pandemic. None of the socio-demographic factors, pain catastrophizing, or sleep disturbance moderated outcome trajectories. However, individuals with higher pain acceptance reported greater improvement in pain severity (P&lt; .008, 95% CI: -.0002, -.00004) and depressive symptoms (P&lt; .001, 95% CI: -.001, -.0004) over time. Our findings suggest that the negative impact of the pandemic on pain, emotional distress, and opioid misuse behaviors is quite small overall. The outcome trajectories were also stable across different socio-demographic factors, as well as individual differences in pain catastrophizing and sleep disturbance. Nevertheless, interventions that target improvement of pain acceptance may help individuals with chronic pain be resilient during the pandemic. PERSPECTIVE: Individuals with chronic pain overall did not experience significant exacerbation of pain, emotional distress, and opioid misuse across one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with higher pain acceptance showed greater improvement in pain severity and depressive symptoms over time during the pandemic.","Adult;Anxiety;Behavior;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Catastrophization;Chronic Pain;Crowdsourcing;Depression;Depressive Symptoms;Factors, Demographic;Female;Growth;Humans;Individuality;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Measurement;Pandemics;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Psychological Distress;Sleep;Sleep Wake Disorders;Time",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Sleep Wake Disorders,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

We build upon the previous call to action and the proposed reframing of study designs articulated in the other papers in the series and seek to confront and eradicate racism through a shared commitment to change current research practices. Specifically, we emphasize the systematic disadvantage created by racialization (ie, the Eurocentric social and political process of ascribing racialized identities to a relationship, social practice, or group) and discuss how engaging communities in partnership can increase the participation of racialized groups in research studies and enrich the knowledge gained. Alongside this critical work, we indicate why diversifying the research environment (ie, research teams, labs, departments, and culture) enriches our scientific discovery and promotes recruitment and retention of participants from racialized groups. Finally, we recommend changes in reporting and dissemination practices so that we do not stigmatize or reproduce oppressive forms of power for racialized groups. Although this shift may be challenging in some cases, the increase in equity, generalizability, and credibility of the data produced will expand our knowledge and reflect the pain experiences of all communities more accurately. PERSPECTIVE: In this third paper in our series, we advocate for a shared commitment toward an antiracism framework in pain research. We identify community partnerships, diversification of research environments, and changes to our dissemination practices as areas where oppressive forms of power can be reduced.","Bias;Classification;Community;Cultural Diversity;Culture;Environment;Form;Humans;Interpersonal Relations;Knowledge;Laboratories;Language;Pain;Paper;Power, Psychological;Racism;Research;Work",Pain,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35288639,2022,The impact of opioid exposure during pregnancy on the human neonatal immune profile.,"The increasing magnitude of the opioid crisis and rising rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) diagnoses highlight the need for increased research into how maternal substance use during pregnancy can impact the neonatal immune profile and its functionality. We hypothesized that neonates with opioid exposure would have reduced proportions of some immune cells, an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, reduced T cell proliferation, and monocyte bacterial killing activity compared to the control population. The present study compares immune cell populations, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum, and monocyte and T cell functional activity using umbilical cord samples from neonates with known opioid exposure during gestation and from control neonates without known exposure. Our findings demonstrated a significant reduction in neutrophils, decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum, and reduced IL-2 production during in vitro CD4+ T cell proliferation in neonates exposed to opioids compared to controls. The neutrophil findings were supported by retrospective analysis of an extended network of deidentified patient records. This study is the first of its kind to evaluate differences in neonatal immunity as a result of opioid exposure in the human population that will inform continued mechanistic studies. The opioid epidemic has become a public health crisis in the United States, and the corresponding incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) have risen accordingly. New research is required to understand the short and long-term health impacts of opioid exposure to the neonate. This is the first human study to investigate the immunologic profile and functionality in neonates with known opioid exposure in utero. The abundance of neutrophils and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes is significantly reduced along with inflammatory cytokines and chemokines following opioid exposure during pregnancy. The immune profile in opioid-exposed neonates may promote susceptibility to infection.","Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Cells;Chemokines;Cytokines;Diagnosis;Female;Health;Humans;Immunity;In Vitro;Incidence;Infant, Newborn;Infections;Interleukin-2;Killing;Lymphocytes;Monocytes;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Neutrophils;News;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Population;Population Control;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Production;Public Health;Records;Research;Retrospective Studies;Serum;Substance Use;T-Lymphocytes;Umbilical Cord;United States",Infections;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Use,Pediatr Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

We also describe cultural humility as a lifelong self-awareness process critical to ending generalizations and successfully applying antiracism research practices through the pain research continuum. In part-2 of the series, we describe research designs that perpetuate racism and provide reframes. Finally, in part-3, we emphasize the implications of an antiracism framework for research dissemination, community-engagement practices and diversity in research teams. Through this series, we invite the pain research community to share our commitment to the active process of antiracism, which involves both self-examination and re-evaluation of research practices shifting our collective work towards eliminating racialized injustices in our approach to pain research.

35295794,2022,"The Concept, Development, and Application of a Home-Based High-Definition tDCS for Bilateral Motor Cortex Modulation in Migraine and Pain.","Whereas, many debilitating chronic pain disorders are dominantly bilateral (e.g., fibromyalgia, chronic migraine), non-invasive and invasive cortical neuromodulation therapies predominantly apply unilateral stimulation. The development of excitatory stimulation targeting bilateral primary motor (M1) cortices could potentially expand its therapeutic effect to more global pain relief. However, this is hampered by increased procedural and technical complexity. For example, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and 4 × 1/2 × 2 high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (4 × 1/2 × 2 HD-tDCS) are largely center-based, with unilateral-target focus-bilateral excitation would require two rTMS/4 × 1 HD-tDCS systems. We developed a system that allows for focal, non-invasive, self-applied, and simultaneous bilateral excitatory M1 stimulation, supporting long-term home-based treatment with a well-tolerated wearable battery-powered device. Here, we overviewed the most employed M1 neuromodulation methods, from invasive techniques to non-invasive TMS and tDCS. The evaluation extended from non-invasive diffuse asymmetric bilateral (M1-supraorbital [SO] tDCS), non-invasive and invasive unilateral focal (4 × 1/2 × 2 HD-tDCS, rTMS, MCS), to non-invasive and invasive bilateral bipolar (M1-M1 tDCS, MCS), before outlining our proposal for a neuromodulatory system with unique features. Computational models were applied to compare brain current flow for current laboratory-based unilateral M11 and bilateral M12 HD-tDCS models with a functional home-based M11-2 HD-tDCS prototype. We concluded the study by discussing the promising concept of bilateral excitatory M1 stimulation for more global pain relief, which is also non-invasive, focal, and home-based.",Brain;Chronic Pain;Devices;Fibromyalgia;Laboratories;Methods;Migraine Disorders;Motor Cortex;Pain;Self;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia;Migraine Disorders;Pain,Front Pain Res (Lausanne),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35296390,2022,Confronting Racism in All Forms of Pain Research: Reframing Study Designs.,"This second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research across the translational spectrum focuses on study design factors. Although objectivity is a cornerstone value of science, subjectivity is embedded in every step of the research process as investigators make choices about who they collaborate with, which research questions they ask, how they recruit participants, which research tools they use, and how they analyze and interpret data. We present theory and evidence from disciplines such as sociology, medical anthropology, statistics, and public health to discuss 4 common study design factors, including 1) the dominant biomedical narrative of pain that restricts funding and exploration of social indicators of pain, 2) low diversity and inclusion in pain research enrollment that restricts generalizability to racialized groups, 3) the use of ""race"" or ""ethnicity"" as a statistical variable and proxy for lived experiences (eg, racism, resilience), and 4) limited modeling in preclinical research for the impact of social factors on pain physiology. The information presented in this article is intended to start conversations across stakeholders in the pain field to explore how we can come together to adopt antiracism practices in our work at large to achieve equity for racialized groups. PERSPECTIVE: This is the second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research. This part identifies common study design factors that risk hindering progress toward pain care equity. We suggest reframes using an antiracism framework for these factors to encourage all pain investigators to collectively make strides toward equity.","Anthropology;Ethnic Groups;Form;Humans;Indicators;Methods;Pain;Paper;Physiology;Proxy;Public Health;Racial Stocks;Racism;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Risk;Science;Social Factors;Sociology, Medical;Statistics;Work",Pain,J Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35420999,2022,Estrogen metabolites increase nociceptor hyperactivity in a mouse model of uterine pain.,"Pain emanating from the female reproductive tract is notoriously difficult to treat, and the prevalence of transient pelvic pain has been placed as high as 70%-80% in women surveyed. Although sex hormones, especially estrogen, are thought to underlie enhanced pain perception in females, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we showed that the pain-initiating TRPA1 channel was required for pain-related behaviors in a mouse model of estrogen-induced uterine pain in ovariectomized female mice. Surprisingly, 2- and 4-hydroxylated estrogen metabolites (2- and 4-HEMs) in the estrogen hydroxylation pathway, but not estrone, estradiol, or 16-HEMs, directly increased nociceptor hyperactivity through TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels, and picomolar concentrations of 2- and 4-hydroxylation estrone (2- or 4-OHE1) could sensitize TRPA1 channel function. Moreover, both TRPA1 and TRPV1 were expressed in uterine-innervating primary nociceptors, and their expression was increased in the estrogen-induced uterine pain model. Importantly, pretreatment with 2- or 4-OHE1 recapitulated estrogen-induced uterine pain-like behaviors, and intraplantar injections of 2- and 4-OHE1 directly produced a TRPA1-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrated that TRPA1 is critically involved in estrogen-induced uterine pain-like behaviors, which may provide a potential drug target for treating female reproductive tract pain.","Animals;Behavior;Disease Models, Animal;Estradiol;Estrogens;Estrone;Female;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Humans;Hydroxylation;Hypersensitivity;Injections;Ion Channels;Mice;Neurosciences;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain Perception;Pelvic Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;TRPA1 Cation Channel;TRPV Cation Channels;Thought;Transient Receptor Potential Channels;Transients;Women",Hypersensitivity;Pain;Pelvic Pain,JCI Insight,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35615042,2022,Classifying Characteristics of Opioid Use Disorder From Hospital Discharge Summaries Using Natural Language Processing.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is underdiagnosed in health system settings, limiting research on OUD using electronic health records (EHRs). Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches. Using the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital discharge summaries of patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) OUD diagnostic codes. We developed an annotation schema to characterize problematic opioid use, identify individuals with potential OUD, and provide psychosocial context. Two annotators reviewed discharge summaries from 100 patients. We randomly sampled patients with their associated annotated sentences and divided them into training (66 patients; 2,127 annotated sentences) and testing (29 patients; 1,149 annotated sentences) sets. We used the training set to generate features, employing three NLP algorithms/knowledge sources. We trained and tested prediction models for classification with a traditional machine learner (logistic regression) and deep learning approach (Autogluon based on ELECTRA's replaced token detection model). We applied a five-fold cross-validation approach to reduce bias in performance estimates. The resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement, with F1-scores across all classes increasing from 48 to 66%. Five classes had a sufficient number of annotations for automation; of these, we observed consistently high performance (F1-scores) across training and testing sets for drug screening (training: 91-96; testing: 91-94) and opioid type (training: 86-96; testing: 86-99). Performance dropped from training and to testing sets for other drug use (training: 52-65; testing: 40-48), pain management (training: 72-78; testing: 61-78) and psychiatric (training: 73-80; testing: 72). Autogluon achieved the highest performance. This pilot study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be manually identified by annotators. However, more training samples and features would improve our ability to reliably identify less common classes from clinical text, including text from outpatient settings.","Ability;Algorithms;Analgesics, Opioid;Automation;Behavior;Bias;Classification;Critical Care;Database;Deep Learning;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Electronic Health Records;Health;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-9;International Classification of Diseases;Knowledge;Learning;Logistic Regression;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain Management;Patient Discharge;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Research;Risk;Scales;Signs and Symptoms;Substance Use",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use,Front Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
35625888,2022,Effect of Prenatal Opioid Exposure on the Human Placental Methylome.,"Prenatal exposure to addictive drugs can lead to placental epigenetic modifications, but a methylome-wide evaluation of placental DNA methylation changes after prenatal opioid exposure has not yet been performed. Placental tissue samples were collected at delivery from 19 opioid-exposed and 20 unexposed control full-term pregnancies. Placental DNA methylomes were profiled using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated CpG sites associated with opioid exposure were identified with a linear model using the 'limma' R package. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) spanning multiple CpG sites, the 'DMRcate' R package was used. The functions of genes mapped by differentially methylated CpG sites and DMRs were further annotated using Enrichr. Differentially methylated CpGs (n = 684, unadjusted p &amp;lt; 0.005 and |∆β| ≥ 0.05) were mapped to 258 genes (including PLD1, MGAM, and ALCS2). Differentially methylated regions (n = 199) were located in 174 genes (including KCNMA1). Enrichment analysis of the top differentially methylated CpG sites and regions indicated disrupted epigenetic regulation of genes involved in synaptic structure, chemical synaptic transmission, and nervous system development. Our findings imply that placental epigenetic changes due to prenatal opioid exposure could result in placental dysfunction, leading to abnormal fetal brain development and the symptoms of opioid withdrawal in neonates.","Brain;DNA Methylation;Epigenetics;Epigenome;Genes;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Lead;Linear Models;Methylation;Nervous System;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placenta;Pregnancy;Regulation;Synaptic Transmission;Syndrome;Tissues",Syndrome,Biomedicines,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
36075888,2022,Single nucleus transcriptomic analysis of rat nucleus accumbens reveals cell type-specific patterns of gene expression associated with volitional morphine intake.,"Opioid exposure is known to cause transcriptomic changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, no studies to date have investigated cell type-specific transcriptomic changes associated with volitional opioid taking. Here, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to comprehensively characterize cell type-specific alterations of the NAc transcriptome in rats self-administering morphine. One cohort of male Brown Norway rats was injected with acute morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. A second cohort of rats was allowed to self-administer intravenous morphine (1.0 mg/kg/infusion) for 10 consecutive days. Each morphine-experienced rat was paired with a yoked saline control rat. snRNAseq libraries were generated from NAc punches and used to identify cell type-specific gene expression changes associated with volitional morphine taking. We identified 1106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the acute morphine group, compared to 2453 DEGs in the morphine self-administration group, across 27 distinct cell clusters. Importantly, we identified 1329 DEGs that were specific to morphine self-administration. DEGs were identified in novel clusters of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and D1R- and D2R-expressing medium spiny neurons in the NAc. Cell type-specific DEGs included Rgs9, Celf5, Oprm1, and Pde10a. Upregulation of Rgs9 and Celf5 in D2R-expressing neurons was validated by RNAscope. Approximately 85% of all oligodendrocyte DEGs, nearly all of which were associated with morphine taking, were identified in two subtypes. Bioinformatic analyses identified cell type-specific upstream regulatory mechanisms of the observed transcriptome alterations and downstream signaling pathways, including both novel and previously identified molecular pathways. These findings show that volitional morphine taking is associated with distinct cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the rat NAc and highlight specific striatal cell populations and novel molecular substrates that could be targeted to reduce compulsive opioid taking.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Astrocytes;Bio-Informatics;Cells;Dates;Gene Expression;Genes;Humans;Libraries;Male;Morphine;Neurons;Norway;Nucleus Accumbens;Oligodendroglia;Opioids;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases;Population;Rats;Self;Self Administration;Sequence Determinations, RNA;Transcriptome;Up-Regulation",,Transl Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
36088171,2022,"""Learn from each other"": A qualitative exploration of collaborative quality improvement.","Collaborative quality improvement is an established method to conduct quality improvement in surgical care. Despite the success of this method, little is known about the experiences, perceptions, and attitudes of those who participate in collaborative quality improvement. The following study elicited common themes associated with the experiences and perceptions of surgeons participating in collaborative quality improvement. We conducted an interpretive description qualitative study of surgeons participating in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, which is a statewide collaborative quality improvement consortium in Michigan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview guide. A sample of 24 participants completed interviews with a mean (SD) age of 48.7 (11.5) years and 16 (80%) male participants. Two major themes were identified. First, the contextualization of individual performance was seen as key to identifying opportunities for improvement and creating motivation to improve. Contextualization of individual performance relative to peer performance was collaborative rather than punitive. Second, peer learning emerged as the primary way to inform practice change and overcome hesitancy to change. Rather than draw upon external evidence, practice change within the collaborative was informed by the practices of peer institutions. Both themes were strongly exemplified in one of the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative's largest initiatives-reducing excessive postoperative opioid prescribing. In this qualitative study of surgeons participating in statewide collaborative quality improvement, contextualization of individual outcomes and peer learning were the most salient themes. Collaborative quality improvement relied upon comparing one's own performance to peer performance, motivating improvement using this comparison, deriving evidence from peers to inform improvement initiatives, and overcoming hesitancy to change by highlighting peer success.","Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude;Female;Humans;Interview;Learning;Male;Methods;Michigan;Middle Aged;Motivation;Opioids;Perception;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Qualitative Research;Quality Improvement;Relatives;Surgeons",,Surgery,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants
36643376,2021,Preliminary Findings of Weaker Executive Control Network Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity in Opioid Use Disorder compared to Healthy Controls.,"Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity has been used as a tool to study brain mechanisms associated with addictions. Recent research in substance use disorders has focused on three brain networks termed the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN). The purpose of this study was to examine the functional connectivity of those three networks in opioid use disorder (OUD) subjects compared to healthy control subjects (HC). The present study investigated functional connectivity differences between OUD subjects compared to HC using independent component analysis. This study also examined the relationship between functional connectivity and negative urgency scores, as well as compared the functional connectivity of severe OUD to mild or moderate OUD. In OUD subjects (n=25) compared to HC (n=25), a cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex within the left ECN had significantly weaker functional connectivity. No significant differences were found between groups for the functional connectivity of the DMN, SN, or right ECN. No significant associations were found between functional connectivity and negative urgency, and no differences were found between severe OUD and mild or moderate OUD. These novel preliminary results suggest that ECN functional connectivity may differ between OUD and HC. This finding is consistent with previous research showing altered executive function in OUD and supports further examination of ECN functional connectivity in association with treatment response in OUD. Given our relatively small sample size (50 subjects total; 25 subjects per group), our results should be treated as preliminary for hypothesis generation, and replication will be needed in future studies.",Association;Brain;Default Mode Network;Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex;Executive Function;Future;Generations;Opioid Use Disorder;Research;Sample Size;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;fMRI,Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Res Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants

The Stakeholder Engagement Work Group is supported by a separately funded Coordinating Center and was formed with the goal of developing respectful and productive partnerships that will maximize the ability to generate trustworthy, internally valid findings directly relevant to veterans and military service members with pain, front-line primary care clinicians and health care teams, and health system leaders. The Stakeholder Engagement Work Group provides a forum to promote success of the PCTs in which principal investigators and/or their designees discuss various stakeholder engagement strategies, address challenges, and share experiences. Herein, we communicate features of meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of pain management pragmatic trials, across the PMC. Our collective experiences suggest that an optimal stakeholder-engaged research project involves understanding the following: i) Who are research stakeholders in PMC trials? ii) How do investigators ensure that stakeholders represent the interests of a study's target treatment population, including individuals from underrepresented groups?, and iii) How can sustained stakeholder relationships help overcome implementation challenges over the course of a PCT?

30368523,2019,Replication of the pharmacogenetic effect of rs678849 on buprenorphine efficacy in African-Americans with opioid use disorder.,"Many patients with opioid use disorder do not have successful outcomes during treatment but the underlying reasons are not well understood. An OPRD1 variant (rs678849) was previously associated with methadone and buprenorphine efficacy in African-Americans with opioid use disorder. The objective of this study was to determine if the effect of rs678849 on opioid use disorder treatment outcome could be replicated in an independent population. Participants were recruited from African-American patients who had participated in previous studies of methadone or buprenorphine treatment at the outpatient treatment research clinic of the NIDA Intramural Research Program in Baltimore, MD, USA between 2000 and 2017. Rs678849 was genotyped retrospectively, and genotypes were compared with urine drug screen results from the previous studies for opioids other than the one prescribed for treatment. Genotypes were available for 24 methadone patients and 55 buprenorphine patients. After controlling for demographics, the effect of rs678849 genotype was significant in the buprenorphine treatment group (RR = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-1.79, p = 0.021). Buprenorphine patients with the C/C genotype were more likely to have opioid-positive drug screens than individuals with the C/T or T/T genotypes, replicating the original pharmacogenetic finding. The effect of genotype was not significant in the methadone group (p = 0.087). Thus, the genotype at rs678849 is associated with buprenorphine efficacy in African-Americans being treated for opioid use disorder. This replication suggests that rs678849 genotype may be a valuable pharmacogenetic marker for deciding which opioid use disorder medication to prescribe in this population.",African Americans;Baltimore;Buprenorphine;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Genotype;Methadone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;Population;Program;Research;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Urine,Opioid Use Disorder,Pharmacogenomics J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants;Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34903397,2022,Assessing the impact of social distancing measures implemented during COVID-19 pandemic on medications for opioid use disorder in West Virginia.,"This study evaluates if social distancing measures instituted during the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with a reduction in Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) prescribing in West Virginia. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the quick implementation of public health interventions such as social distancing. This led to the use of telemedicine in the clinical setting however implementing telemedicine involves system level and infrastructure level changes within a healthcare environment. This could cause a barrier to MOUD delivery as it is often provided concomitantly with other face to face substance use and mental health services. The purpose of this study is to determine whether social distancing was associated with a reduction in MOUD prescribing in West Virginia, with the goal of adding to the knowledge of how COVID-19 and COVID-19-related mitigation strategies have impacted patients with OUD. Prescription monitoring data were requested from the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy. We applied interrupted time series modeling to investigate MOUD prescribing practices before and after social distancing took effect. Gabapentin prescriptions were utilized as a control for comparison. Our study assessed state-wide buprenorphine and Suboxone prescriptions as compared to a control medication and found an increase in dosage of both medications and an increase in number of buprenorphine prescriptions, but a small decrease in buprenorphine/naloxone prescription number related to the dates of implementation of social distancing. Taken together, overall this indicates an increase in prescription number of MOUD prescriptions as well as an increase in dosage. This study suggests that social distancing measures were associated with an increase in both the number of MOUD prescriptions and the number of doses in each prescription. Significant alterations to MOUD delivery in the clinical setting were implemented in a short timeframe with the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the implementation of clinical measures to accommodate social distancing measures may provide benefit to transformation of future delivery of MOUD.","Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Comprehension;Dates;Environment;Face;Future;Gabapentin;Goals;Health Care;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Knowledge;Measures;Mental Health Services;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Pandemics;Patients;Pharmacies;Physical Distancing;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Public Health;SARS Virus;SARS-CoV-2;Suboxone;Substance Use;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;West Virginia",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants;Prevention
33387660,2021,β-endorphin at the intersection of pain and cancer progression: Preclinical evidence.,"We examined the association between endogenous opioid β-endorphin, cancer progression and pain in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, with a rat C3(1) simian virus 40 large tumor antigen fusion gene (C3TAg). C3TAg mice develop ductal epithelial atypia at 8 weeks, progression to intra-epithelial neoplasia at 12 weeks, and invasive carcinoma with palpable tumors at 16 weeks. Consistent with invasive carcinoma at 4 months of age, C3TAg mice demonstrate a significant increase in hyperalgesia compared to younger C3TAg or control FVBN mice without tumors. Our data show that the growing tumor contributes to circulating β-endorphin. As an endogenous ligand of mu opioid receptor, β-endorphin has analgesic activity. Paradoxically, we observed an increase in pain in transgenic breast cancer mice with significantly high circulating and tumor-associated β-endorphin. Increased circulating β-endorphin correlates with increasing tumor burden. β-endorphin induced the activation of mitogenic and survival-promoting signaling pathways, MAPK/ERK 1/2, STAT3 and Akt, observed by us in human MDA-MB-231 cells suggesting a role for β-endorphin in breast cancer progression and associated pain.","Analgesics;Animals;Association;Biomarkers;Breast Cancer;Breast Neoplasms;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Carcinoma;Cell Line, Tumor;Cells;Disease Progression;Female;Gene Fusion;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Ligands;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Morphine;Neoplasms;Opioids;Pain;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Simian virus 40;Survival;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;beta-Endorphin",Breast Cancer;Breast Neoplasms;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Carcinoma;Disease Progression;Hyperalgesia;Neoplasms;Pain,Neurosci Lett,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grants;Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment

35434355,2021,Justice and equity in pragmatic clinical trials: Considerations for pain research within integrated health systems.,"Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) can overcome implementation challenges for bringing evidence-based therapies to people living with pain and co-occurring conditions, providing actionable information for patients, providers, health systems, and policy makers. All studies, including those conducted within health systems that have a history of advancing equitable care, should make efforts to address justice and equity. Drawing from collective experience within pragmatic pain clinical trials networks, and synthesizing relevant literature, our multidisciplinary working group examined challenges related to integrating justice and equity into pragmatic pain management research conducted in large, integrated health systems. Our analysis draws from military and veteran health system contexts but offers strategies to consider throughout the lifecycle of pragmatic research more widely. We found that PCTs present a unique opportunity to address major influences on health inequities by occupying a space between research, healthcare delivery, and the complexities of everyday life. We highlight key challenges that require attention to support complementary advancement of justice and equity via pragmatic research, offering several strategies that can be pursued. Efforts are needed to engage diverse stakeholders broadly and creatively in PCTs, such as through dedicated health equity working groups and other collaborative relationships with stakeholders, to support robust and inclusive approaches to research design and implementation across study settings. These considerations, while essential to pain management research, offer important opportunities toward achieving more equitable healthcare and health systems to benefit people living with pain and co-occurring conditions.",Address;Attention;Clinical Trial;Drawing;Ethics;Health;Health Care;Health Equity;Health Services Research;History;Justice;Life;Literature;Military Personnel;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Persons;Policy Makers;Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic;Research;Research Design;Therapeutics;Veterans Health,Pain,Learn Health Syst,Clinical Research in Pain Management;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Administrative Supplements for Pain and Opioid grantsBack pain consortium (BACPAC)
31913193,2020,Presentation and Characteristics of Abdominal Pain Vary by Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subtype: Results of a Nationwide Population-Based Study.,"Abdominal pain is a cardinal feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, differences in abdominal pain among IBS subtypes remain unknown. We aimed to characterize abdominal pain symptoms among established IBS subtypes using data from the National Gastrointestinal (GI) Survey. Individuals participating in the National GI Survey completed National Institutes of Health GI Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (GI-PROMIS) questionnaires. Adults meeting modified Rome III IBS criteria and reporting abdominal pain in the previous 7 days were eligible. Outcomes included abdominal pain severity, bothersomeness, interference with daily activities, frequency, and location. Results were stratified by subtype (diarrhea [IBS-D], constipation [IBS-C], and mixed [IBS-M]). Regression models adjusted for demographics and comorbidities. One thousand one hundred fifty-eight individuals (245 IBS-D, 232 IBS-C, and 681 IBS-M) with active IBS symptoms (defined as abdominal pain in the past 7 days) were included. Demographics were similar among the subtypes except for age, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. The GI-PROMIS score was lower for IBS-D (percentile score of 68.6, SD = 25.1; P = 0.001) and IBS-M (69.1, SD = 25.1; P &lt; 0.001) compared with IBS-C (75.5, SD = 20.7). Abdominal pain was more bothersome (P = 0.001), caused more interference with daily activities (P = 0.03), and was more frequent (P = 0.047) for individuals with IBS-C compared with individuals with IBS-D. No differences in these domains were seen between individuals with IBS-D and IBS-M. Individuals with IBS-C and IBS-M had more widespread pain compared with those with IBS-D. In this population-based study, we found that abdominal pain characteristics differ between the IBS subtypes. Namely, individuals with IBS-C experience more bothersome, frequent, and diffuse abdominal pain compared with those with IBS-D.",Abdominal Pain;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Comorbidity;Constipation;Demography;Diarrhea;Education;Ethnic Groups;Female;Humans;Information Systems;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Male;Marital Status;Middle Aged;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Pain;Pain Measurement;Patient Reported Outcomes;Population;Questionnaires;Racial Stocks;Rome;Surveys;Young Adult,Abdominal Pain;Constipation;Diarrhea;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Pain,Am J Gastroenterol,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Back pain consortium (BACPAC)

A total of 60,730 participants were included, using data from the Military Health System Data Repository, a large single-payer government health system. Outcomes included total knee-related care visits and costs, knee surgeries, opioid prescriptions, and 2-year recurrence. Stepped care was based on interventions delivered within the appropriate timing and in the appropriate order (low risk/cost before high risk/cost). A total of 54,460 (89.7%) participants received adherent Step 1 care, 10,964 (18.1%) received step 2, and 4168 (6.9%) received step 3. A total of 32.0% and 50.8%, respectively, of all patients in Step 2 and Step 3 care were adherent. Of the 2385 participants (3.9% of cohort) that received both Step 2 and Step 3 care, 24.8% of participants received adherent care. For participants receiving both Step 2 and Step 3 care, adherence resulted in cost savings (mean difference [MD] $1708; 95% confidence interval [CI]: $1241, 2175), fewer knee-related visits (MD 3.4; 95% CI 2.2, 4.7), fewer episodes of knee pain (MD 0.7; 95% CI 0.5, 0.8), fewer knee surgeries (adjusted odds ratio 0.4; 95% CI 0.3, 0.5), and fewer opioid prescriptions (adjusted odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5, 0.8).

While previous studies reported these Group-Based Opioid Treatment (GBOT) models are feasible for providers and acceptable to patients, there has been no literature to help providers with the more practical aspects of how to create and maintain GBOT in different outpatient settings. Case series: We present 4 cases of GBOT implementation across a large academic health care system, highlighting various potential approaches for providers who seek to implement GBOT and demonstrate ""success"" based on feasibility and sustainability of these models. For each case, we describe the pros and cons and detail the personnel and resources involved, patient mix and group format, workflow logistics, monitoring and management, and sustainability components. Discussion: The implementation details illustrate that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, although feasibility is commonly supported by a team-based, patient-centered medical home. This approach includes the capacity for referral to higher levels of mental health and addiction support services and is bolstered by ongoing provider communication and shared resources across the health system. Future research identifying the core and malleable components to implementation, their evidence base, and how they might be influenced by site-specific resources, culture, and other contextual factors can help providers better understand how to implement a GBOT model in their unique clinical environment.","Ambulatory Care;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Communication;Culture;Environment;Future;Health;Health Care Systems;Humans;Implementation Science;Literature;Logistics;Medical Home;Mental Health;Narcotic Antagonists;Occupational Groups;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Primary Health Care;Psychiatry;Psychotherapy, Group;Referral;Research;Resources;Shared Medical Appointments;Therapeutics;Workflow",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM)
31882001,2019,Building a Group-Based Opioid Treatment (GBOT) blueprint: a qualitative study delineating GBOT implementation.,"Group-Based Opioid Treatment (GBOT) has recently emerged as a mechanism for treating patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the outpatient setting. However, the more practical ""how to"" components of successfully delivering GBOT has received little attention in the medical literature, potentially limiting its widespread implementation and utilization. Building on a previous case series, this paper delineates the key components to implementing GBOT by asking: (a) What are the core components to GBOT implementation, and how are they defined? (b) What are the malleable components to GBOT implementation, and what conceptual framework should providers use in determining how to apply these components for effective delivery in their unique clinical environment? To create a blueprint delineating GBOT implementation, we integrated findings from a previously conducted and separately published systematic review of existing GBOT studies, conducted additional literature review, reviewed best practice recommendations and policies related to GBOT and organizational frameworks for implementing health systems change. We triangulated this data with a qualitative thematic analysis from 5 individual interviews and 2 focus groups representing leaders from 5 different GBOT programs across our institution to identify the key components to GBOT implementation, distinguish ""core"" and ""malleable"" components, and provide a conceptual framework for considering various options for implementing the malleable components. We identified 6 core components to GBOT implementation that optimize clinical outcomes, comply with mandatory policies and regulations, ensure patient and staff safety, and promote sustainability in delivery. These included consistent group expectations, team-based approach to care, safe and confidential space, billing compliance, regular monitoring, and regular patient participation. We identified 14 malleable components and developed a novel conceptual framework that providers can apply when deciding how to employ each malleable component that considers empirical, theoretical and practical dimensions. While further research on the effectiveness of GBOT and its individual implementation components is needed, the blueprint outlined here provides an initial framework to help office-based opioid treatment sites implement a successful GBOT approach and hence potentially serve as future study sites to establish efficacy of the model. This blueprint can also be used to continuously monitor how components of GBOT influence treatment outcomes, providing an empirical framework for the ongoing process of refining implementation strategies.","Attention;Best Practices;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Compliance;Confidentiality;Environment;Expectations;Focus Groups;Future;Group Processes;Health;Humans;Implementation Science;Interview;Literature;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Paper;Patient Care Team;Patient Participation;Patients;Policy;Program;Psychotherapy, Group;Qualitative Research;Regulation;Research;Review;Safety;Shared Medical Appointments;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM)
33907663,2021,New and Emerging Opioid Overdose Risk Factors.,"The purpose of this review is to provide a review of the current literature surrounding opioid overdose risk factors, focusing on relatively new factors in the opioid crisis. Both a market supply driving force and a subpopulation of people who use opioids actively seeking out fentanyl are contributing to its recent proliferation in the opioid market. Harm reduction techniques such as fentanyl testing strips, naloxone education and distribution, drug sampling behaviors, and supervised injection facilities are all seeing expanded use with increasing amounts of research being published regarding their effectiveness. Availability and use of interventions such as medication for opioid use disorder and peer recovery coaching programs are also on the rise to prevent opioid overdose.

33357608,2021,The opioid epidemic: Mobilizing an academic health center to improve outcomes.,"Since 2000, opioid use disorder (OUD) has become an epidemic in the United States with more than 600,000 total deaths and a $51 billion annual cost. Patients with OUD require services from community-based organizations, local and state health departments, and health systems, all of which necessitate communication and collaboration among these groups to develop an effective strategy for diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care. Academic health centers (AHCs) are poised to make significant contributions to the care of patients with OUD given in-house expertise across multiple medical specialties and the mission to care for patients in need. Despite the potential for AHCs to provide necessary services and address this public health crisis, progress has been slow. Many AHCs lack a clear roadmap for moving this agenda forward in their local regions. In response to rising deaths due to OUD, the authors' AHC undertook a significant redesign effort to facilitate the necessary processes and interdepartmental collaboration to provide patient-centered, comprehensive care for patients with OUD. In this article, using an organizational development framework (McKinsey 7S model), the authors describe their transformation process, and articulate strategies and potential barriers to implementing this framework. The goal of the article is to highlight the structural, procedural, and cultural changes that have occurred in one AHC so we can assist other AHCs in addressing the opioid epidemic.","Academic Medical Centers;Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Change Management;Communication;Community;Cost;Death;Diagnosis;Epidemics;Goals;Health;Humans;Learning;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizational Innovation;Organizational Objectives;Organizations;Patients;Public Health;Quality Assurance, Health Care;Religious Missions;Specialties, Medical;Therapeutics;United States",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM);Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33570000,2021,Regional variation in discussion of opioids on social media.,"New data sources and analysis methods are urgently needed to improve opioid surveillance and prevent potential overdose. Social media data is one potential data source that might be used and integrated to address this issue. Objective: This study explored opioid-related topics discussed across geographical regions of varying population sizes to determine whether social media data might inform opioid surveillance. Methods: Between March 17th to July 17th, 2020, we collected tweets (N = 19,721) mentioning opioid-related keywords across seven cities within the United States. Results: Results found that opioid-related keywords were distributed as follows: New York (29%), Los Angeles (23%), Chicago (18%), Atlanta (18%), San Francisco (8%), Iowa (3%), and Orange County, CA (1%). We also found regional differences in the types of opioids and topics mentioned. Conclusions: Findings suggest the feasibility of using opioid-related social media data to inform surveillance efforts, as well as potential regional and time-varying differences in topics discussed.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Big Data;Chicago;Cities;Consumption;Data Sources;Demography;Humans;Iowa;Los Angeles;Methods;New York;News;Opioids;Oranges;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population Size;Public Health Surveillance;San Francisco;Social Media;Time;United States",,J Addict Dis,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM);Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion

33574500,2021,Internet search and medicaid prescription drug data as predictors of opioid emergency department visits.,"The primary contributors to the opioid crisis continue to rapidly evolve both geographically and temporally, hampering the ability to halt the growing epidemic. To address this issue, we evaluated whether integration of near real-time social/behavioral (i.e., Google Trends) and traditional health care (i.e., Medicaid prescription drug utilization) data might predict geographic and longitudinal trends in opioid-related Emergency Department (ED) visits. From January 2005 through December 2015, we collected quarterly State Drug Utilization Data; opioid-related internet search terms/phrases; and opioid-related ED visit data. Modeling was conducted using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression prediction. Models combining Google and Medicaid variables were a better fit and more accurate (R2 values from 0.913 to 0.960, across states) than models using either data source alone. The combined model predicted sharp and state-specific changes in ED visits during the post 2013 transition from heroin to fentanyl. Models integrating internet search and drug utilization data might inform policy efforts about regional medical treatment preferences and needs.","Ability;Address;Data Sources;Drug Utilization;Emergency Service, Hospital;Epidemics;Fentanyl;Health Care;Heroin;Internet;Medicaid;Needs;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Phrases;Policy;Prescription Drugs;Therapeutics;Time",,NPJ Digit Med,Cross-Cutting Projects;New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM);Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion;Prevention
34466133,2021,Potential Effects of Digital Inequality on Treatment Seeking for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Despite the availability of effective treatment, medications for opioid use disorder are underutilized due to a variety of practical, political, and psychological reasons. Digital inequalities, such as limited access to technology, skills to leverage the technology for desirable outcomes, and social resources, may be contributing to negative health outcomes. In addition, broader health literacy plays an integral part in the capacity of individuals to appraise opioid medication-related online information. This paper explores the role of digital inequalities in the uptake of treatment for opioid use disorder. Given the shift toward telemedicine and online counseling for substance use treatment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more research into the digital inequalities faced by those who misuse opioids may provide insight into ways of engaging and encouraging this population to utilize treatment.",COVID-19 Pandemic;Counseling;Health;Health Literacy;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Paper;Play;Population;Research;Resources;Role;Substance Use;Technology;Telemedicine;Therapeutics,COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use,Int J Ment Health Addict,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Behavioral Research to Improve Medication Assisted Treatment (BRIM);Patient Engagement & Diversity and Inclusion
34731242,2021,Preoperative Opioid Utilization Patterns and Postoperative Opioid Utilization: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Among chronic opioid users, the association between decreasing or increasing preoperative opioid utilization and postoperative outcomes is unknown. The authors hypothesized that decreasing utilization would be associated with improved outcomes and increasing utilization with worsened outcomes. Using commercial insurance claims, the authors identified 57,019 chronic opioid users (10 or more prescriptions or 120 or more days supplied during the preoperative year), age 18 to 89 yr, undergoing one of 10 surgeries between 2004 and 2018. Patients with a 20% or greater decrease or increase in opioid utilization between preoperative days 7 to 90 and 91 to 365 were compared to patients with less than 20% change (stable utilization). The primary outcome was opioid utilization during postoperative days 91 to 365. Secondary outcomes included alternative measures of postoperative opioid utilization (filling a minimum number of prescriptions during this period), postoperative adverse events, and healthcare utilization. The average age was 63 ± 13 yr, with 38,045 (66.7%) female patients. Preoperative opioid utilization was decreasing for 12,347 (21.7%) patients, increasing for 21,330 (37.4%) patients, and stable for 23,342 (40.9%) patients. Patients with decreasing utilization were slightly less likely to fill an opioid prescription during postoperative days 91 to 365 compared to stable patients (89.2% vs. 96.4%; odds ratio, 0.323; 95% CI, 0.296 to 0.352; P &lt; 0.001), though the average daily doses were similar among patients who continued to utilize opioids during this timeframe (46.7 vs. 46.5 morphine milligram equivalents; difference, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.8 to 1.2; P = 0.684). Of patients with increasing utilization, 93.6% filled opioid prescriptions during this period (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.62; P &lt; 0.001), with slightly lower average daily doses (44.3 morphine milligram equivalents; difference, -2.2; 95% CI, -3.1 to -1.3; P &lt; 0.001). Except for alternative measures of persistent postoperative opioid utilization, there were no clinically significant differences for the secondary outcomes. Changes in preoperative opioid utilization were not associated with clinically significant differences for several postoperative outcomes including postoperative opioid utilization. null","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cohort Studies;Female;General Surgery;Health Care;Humans;Insurance;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Morphine;Odds Ratio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Postoperative Period;Preoperative Care;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies","Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative",Anesthesiology,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,"Biomarkers, Endpoints and Signatures for Pain Conditions"
35302974,2022,Amygdala functional connectivity mediates the association between catastrophizing and threat-safety learning in youth with chronic pain.,"There is a need to identify brain connectivity alterations predictive of transdiagnostic processes that may confer vulnerability for affective symptomology. Here, we tested whether amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) mediated the relationship between catastrophizing (negative threat appraisals and predicting poorer functioning) and altered threat-safety discrimination learning (critical to flexibly adapt to new and changing environments) in adolescents with persistent pain. We examined amygdala rsFC in 46 youth with chronic pain and 29 healthy peers (age M = 15.8, SD = 2.9; 64 females) and its relationship with catastrophizing and threat-safety learning. We used a developmentally appropriate threat-safety learning paradigm and performed amygdala seed-based rsFC and whole-brain mediation analyses. Patients exhibited enhanced connectivity between the left amygdala and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (cluster-level P-FDR &lt; 0.05), whereas right amygdala rsFC showed no group differences. Only in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with facilitated threat-safety learning (CS+&gt;CS-; rp = 0.49, P = 0.001). Furthermore, in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with reduced left amygdala connectivity with SMG / parietal operculum, and increased left amygdala connectivity with hippocampus, dorsal striatum, paracingulate, and motor regions (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, blunted left amygdala rsFC with right SMG/parietal operculum mediated the association between catastrophizing and threat-safety learning (P &lt; 0.001). To conclude, rsFC between the left amygdala (a core emotion hub) and inferior parietal lobe (involved in appraisal and integration of bodily signals and attentional reorienting) explains associations between daily-life relevant catastrophizing and threat-safety learning. Findings provide a putative model for understanding pathophysiology involved in core psychological processes that cut across diagnoses, including disabling pain, and are relevant for their etiology.",Adolescent;Amygdala;Association;Brain;Brain Mapping;Catastrophization;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Diagnosis;Discrimination Learning;Emotions;Environment;Female;Hippocampus;Humans;Learning;Life;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Mediation Analysis;Needs;News;Pain;Parietal Lobe;Patients;Psychologic Processes;Safety;Seeds;Supramarginal Gyrus;Youth,Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,"Biomarkers, Endpoints and Signatures for Pain Conditions"
33921642,2021,Early Life Stress and Risks for Opioid Misuse: Review of Data Supporting Neurobiological Underpinnings.,"A robust body of research has shown that traumatic experiences occurring during critical developmental periods of childhood when neuronal plasticity is high increase risks for a spectrum of physical and mental health problems in adulthood, including substance use disorders. However, until recently, relatively few studies had specifically examined the relationships between early life stress (ELS) and opioid use disorder (OUD). Associations with opioid use initiation, injection drug use, overdose, and poor treatment outcome have now been demonstrated. In rodents, ELS has also been shown to increase the euphoric and decrease antinociceptive effects of opioids, but little is known about these processes in humans or about the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie these relationships. This review aims to establish a theoretical model that highlights the mechanisms by which ELS may alter opioid sensitivity, thereby contributing to future risks for OUD. Alterations induced by ELS in mesocorticolimbic brain circuits, and endogenous opioid and dopamine neurotransmitter systems are described. The limited but provocative evidence linking these alterations with opioid sensitivity and risks for OUD is presented. Overall, the findings suggest that better understanding of these mechanisms holds promise for reducing vulnerability, improving prevention strategies, and prescribing guidelines for high-risk individuals.","Association;Brain;Comprehension;Dopamine;Early Life Stress;Emotions;Future;Guideline;Humans;Injections;Mental Health;Models, Theoretical;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurotransmitters;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Research;Review;Reward;Risk;Rodentia;Sensitivity;Substance Use Disorders;Treatment Outcome",Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders,J Pers Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,"Biomarkers, Endpoints and Signatures for Pain Conditions;Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse"
32165150,2020,Fentanyl self-administration impacts brain immune responses in male Sprague-Dawley rats.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) affects over two million in the United States and is an increasing public health crisis. The abuse of fentanyl and the emergence of potent fentanyl derivatives increases the risk for the user to succumb to overdose, but also to develop OUD. While intense attention is currently focused on understanding the complexity of behaviors and neural functions that contribute to OUD, much remains to be discovered concerning the interactions of opioid intake with the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that short-term abstinence from fentanyl self-administration associates with altered expression of innate immune markers. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer fentanyl (0.0032 mg/kg/infusion) to stability followed by 24 h of abstinence. Several innate immune markers, as well as opioid receptors (ORs) and intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), were interrogated within nodes of the neurocircuitry involved in OUD processes, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu), hippocampus (HIP) and midbrain (MB). In the present study, few immune targets were impacted in the PFC and MB during short-term abstinence from fentanyl (relative to saline) self-administration. However, increased expression of cytokines [e.g., interleukin (IL)1β, IL5], chemokines [e.g., C-C motif chemokine 20 (MIP3α)], tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon (IFN) proteins (e.g., IFNβ and IFNγ)] was seen in the NAc, while decreased expression of cytokines (e.g., several ILs), chemokines [e.g., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) MCP1, MIP3α], the chemokine ligand 5 (RANTES) and interferons (e.g., IFNβ and IFNγ) in the HIP. Positive correlations were observed between cumulative fentanyl intake and expression of IL1β and IL6 in the NAc, and significant negative correlations with fentanyl intake and IFN β, IL2, IL5, IL12p70 and IL17 in the HIP. Few changes in OR expression was observed during early abstinence from fentanyl self-administration. Excitingly, the expression of the PRR, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) negatively correlated with cumulative fentanyl intake and significantly correlated to specific cytokines, chemokines and interferon proteins in the HIP. Although the CPu appears relatively invulnerable to changes in innate immune markers, the highest correlations between cumulative fentanyl intake with MAVS and/or STING was measured in the CPu. Our findings provide the first evidence of CNS innate immune responses and implicate STING as novel mechanistic targets of immunomodulation during short-term abstinence from fentanyl self-administration.","Affect;Animals;Attention;Behavior;Brain;Central Nervous System;Chemokine CCL20;Chemokine CCL5;Chemokines;Comprehension;Cytokines;Fentanyl;Genes;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Hip;Hippocampus;Immunity;Immunity, Innate;Immunomodulation;Interferons;Interleukin-12;Interleukin-17;Interleukin-1beta;Interleukin-2;Interleukin-5;Interleukin-6;Interleukins;Ligands;Male;Markers, Immunologic;Mesencephalon;Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Prefrontal Cortex;Proteins;Public Health;Putamen;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Pattern Recognition;Relatives;Risk;Self;Self Administration;Stings;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha;United States",Necrosis;Neoplasms;Opioid Use Disorder;Stings,Brain Behav Immun,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Development of Novel Immunotheraputics for Opioid Addiction

Vaccine immunotherapy for FEN-associated disorders may be a viable therapeutic strategy. Here, we expand and confirm our previous study in mice showing immunological and antinociception efficacy of our FEN vaccine administered with the adjuvant dmLT. In this study, immunized male and female rats produced significant levels of anti-FEN antibodies that were highly effective at neutralizing FEN-induced antinociception in the tail flick assay and hot plate assays. The vaccine also decreased FEN brain levels following drug administration. Immunization blocked FEN-induced, but not morphine-induced, rate-disrupting effects on schedule-controlled responding. Vaccination prevented decreases on physiological measures (oxygen saturation, heart rate) and reduction in overall activity following FEN administration in male rats. The impact of FEN on these measures was greater in unvaccinated male rats compared to unvaccinated female rats. Cross-reactivity assays showed anti-FEN antibodies bound to FEN and sufentanil but not to morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, or oxycodone.

29140922,2018,Fingolimod reduces neuropathic pain behaviors in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1-dependent inhibition of central sensitization in the dorsal horn.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-inflammatory neurodegenerative disease that is often accompanied by a debilitating neuropathic pain. Disease-modifying agents slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis and prevent relapses, yet it remains unclear if they yield analgesia. We explored the analgesic potential of fingolimod (FTY720), an agonist and/or functional antagonist at the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), because it reduces hyperalgesia in models of peripheral inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We used a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35 to 55 (MOG35-55) mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, modified to avoid frank paralysis, and thus, allow for assessment of withdrawal behaviors to somatosensory stimuli. Daily intraperitoneal fingolimod reduced behavioral signs of central neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold hypersensitivity) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Both autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fingolimod changed hyperalgesia before modifying motor function, suggesting that pain-related effects and clinical neurological deficits were modulated independently. Fingolimod also reduced cellular markers of central sensitization of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: glutamate-evoked Ca signaling and stimulus-evoked phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase ERK (pERK) expression, as well as upregulation of astrocytes (GFAP) and macrophage/microglia (Iba1) immunoreactivity. The antihyperalgesic effects of fingolimod were prevented or reversed by the S1PR1 antagonist W146 (1 mg/kg daily, i.p.) and could be mimicked by either repeated or single injection of the S1PR1-selective agonist SEW2871. Fingolimod did not change spinal membrane S1PR1 content, arguing against a functional antagonist mechanism. We conclude that fingolimod behaves as an S1PR1 agonist to reduce pain in multiple sclerosis by reversing central sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Anilides;Animals;Astrocytes;Behavior;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Cold Temperature;Disease;Disease Models, Animal;Encephalomyelitis;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental;FTY-720;Female;Fingolimod;Fingolimod Hydrochloride;Glutamates;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Immunosuppressive Agents;Injections;Macrophages;Male;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microglia;Motor Activity;Multiple Sclerosis;Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein;Neuralgia;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Neurons;Nociceptors;Organophosphonates;Oxadiazoles;Pain;Pain Threshold;Paralysis;Peptide Fragments;Phosphotransferases;Receptors, Lysosphingolipid;Relapse;S1P1 Receptor;Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Spinal Nerve Roots;Subcellular Fractions;Thiophenes;Up-Regulation;eIF-2 Kinase","Encephalomyelitis;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Multiple Sclerosis;Neuralgia;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Pain;Paralysis;Relapse",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
29708941,2018,High-fat diet exacerbates postoperative pain and inflammation in a sex-dependent manner.,"Obesity is often associated with increased pain, but little is known about the effects of obesity and diet on postoperative pain. In this study, effects of diet and obesity were examined in the paw incision model, a preclinical model of postoperative pain. Long-Evans rats were fed high-fat diet (40% calories from butter fat) or low-fat normal chow. Male rats fed high-fat diet starting 6 weeks before incision (a diet previously shown to induce markers of obesity) had prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity and an overall increase in spontaneous pain in response to paw incision, compared with normal chow controls. Diet effects in females were minor. Removing high-fat diet for 2 weeks before incision reversed the diet effects on pain behaviors, although this was not enough time to reverse high-fat diet-induced weight gain. A shorter (1 week) exposure to high-fat diet before incision also increased pain behaviors in males, albeit to a lesser degree. The 6-week high-fat diet increased macrophage density as examined immunohistochemically in lumbar dorsal root ganglion even before paw incision, especially in males, and sensitized responses of peritoneal macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimuli in vitro. The nerve regeneration marker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) in skin near the incision (day 4) was higher in the high-fat diet group, and wound healing was delayed. In summary, high-fat diet increased postoperative pain particularly in males, but some diet effects did not depend on weight gain. Even short-term dietary manipulations, that do not affect obesity, may enhance postoperative pain.","Affect;Animals;Behavior;Behavior, Animal;Butter;Diet;Diet, High-Fat;Energy Intake;Fats;Female;GAP-43 Protein;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypersensitivity;In Vitro;Inflammation;Lipopolysaccharides;Macrophages;Macrophages, Peritoneal;Male;Minors;Nerve Regeneration;Obesity;Overall;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;Sex;Sex Factors;Skin;Time;Weight Gain;Wound Healing","Ganglion Cysts;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Obesity;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Weight Gain;Wounds",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
29752984,2018,Antinociceptive Effects of the Antidepressant Phenelzine are Mediated by Context-Dependent Inhibition of Neuronal Responses in the Dorsal Horn.,"The putative strong anti-nociceptive properties of the antidepressant phenelzine (PLZ) have not been widely explored as a treatment for pain. Antinociceptive effects of PLZ were identified in the formalin model of tonic pain (Mifflin et al., 2016) and in allodynia associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, (EAE) a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (Potter et al., 2016). Here, we further clarify the specific types of stimuli and contexts in which PLZ modulates nociceptive sensitivity. Our findings indicate that PLZ selectively inhibits ongoing inflammatory pain while sparing transient reflexive and acute nociception. We also investigated the cellular mechanisms of action of PLZ in the dorsal horn, and as expected of a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, PLZ increased serotonin (5HT) immunoreactivity. We next used two approaches to test the hypothesis that PLZ inhibits the activation of spinal nociresponsive neurons. First, we evaluated the formalin-evoked protein expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos. PLZ reduced Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn. Second, we evaluated the effects of PLZ on intracellular calcium responses to superfusion of glutamate (0.3-1.0 mM) in an ex vivo lumbar spinal cord slice preparation. Superfusion with PLZ (100-300 μM) reduced 1 mM glutamate-evoked calcium responses. This was blocked by pretreatment with the 5HT1A-receptor antagonist WAY-100,635, but not the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. We conclude that PLZ exerts antinociceptive effects through a 5-HT/5HT1AR-dependent inhibition of neuronal responses within nociceptive circuits of the dorsal horn.","Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Antagonists;Allodynia;Animals;Antidepressive Agents;Calcium;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental;Female;Formalin;Genes, Immediate-Early;Glutamates;Hyperalgesia;Idazoxan;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors;Multiple Sclerosis;Neurons;Nociception;Pain;Phenelzine;Proteins;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A;Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT1;Sensitivity;Serotonin;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics;Transients","Allodynia;Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental;Hyperalgesia;Multiple Sclerosis;Pain",Neuroscience,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
30114475,2018,The left central nucleus of the amygdala contributes to mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia following right-sided peripheral nerve injury.,"The left and right central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) exert asymmetric pronociceptive functions. In the setting of a transient noxious stimulus or persistent inflammatory pain, neuronal activity increases in the right but not left CeA, regardless of side of injury. Much less is known regarding this lateralization with respect to the behavioral manifestations of persistent neuropathic pain. To address this question, we conducted spared nerve injury (SNI) to the left or right hindlimb and then inactivated the left and/or right CeA with local microinjection of lidocaine. We evaluated injury-induced hypersensitivity with von Frey hairs (mechanical allodynia), a blunt pin (mechanical hyperalgesia), and acetone application (cold allodynia). Following left-sided SNI, inactivation of the right or bilateral CeA attenuated mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as cold hypersensitivity, while inactivation of the left CeA had no effect. Following right-sided SNI, we observed a modality-dependent effect: mechanical allodynia was attenuated by inactivation of the left but neither the right nor bilateral CeA, mechanical hyperalgesia was attenuated by left, right and bilateral intra-CeA lidocaine, and cold allodynia was unaffected. These data suggest that CeA-mediated control of neuropathic pain is not strictly limited to the right CeA as previously assumed. We conclude that functional lateralization depends on the type of pain, side of injury and the sensory modality, and that the left CeA contributes to mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve injury to the right side of the body.","Acetone;Address;Allodynia;Amygdala;Anesthetics, Local;Animals;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Cold Temperature;Functional Laterality;Hair;Hindlimb;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Lidocaine;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Microinjections;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Respect;Transients",Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Neurosci Lett,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
30442166,2018,Preemptive intrathecal administration of endomorphins relieves inflammatory pain in male mice via inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling and regulation of inflammatory cytokines.,"Preemptive administration of analgesic drugs reduces perceived pain and prolongs duration of antinociceptive action. Whereas several lines of evidence suggest that endomorphins, the endogenous mu-opioid agonists, attenuate acute and chronic pain at the spinal level, their preemptive analgesic effects remain to be determined. In this study, we evaluated the anti-allodynic activities of endomorphins and explored their mechanisms of action after preemptive administration in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. The anti-allodynic activities of preemptive intrathecal administration of endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 were investigated in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain model and paw incision-induced postoperative pain model. The modulating effects of endomorphins on the expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and inflammatory mediators in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of CFA-treated mice were assayed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, or immunofluorescence staining. Preemptive intrathecal injection of endomorphins dose-dependently attenuated CFA-induced mechanical allodynia via the mu-opioid receptor and significantly reversed paw incision-induced allodynia. In addition, CFA-caused increase of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in DRG was dramatically reduced by preemptive administration of endomorphins. Repeated intrathecal application of the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reduced CFA-induced mechanical allodynia as well. Further RT-PCR assay showed that endomorphins regulated the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in DRGs induced by peripheral inflammation. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which preemptive treatment of endomorphins attenuates inflammatory pain through regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines in DRG neurons via inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation.","Administration;Allodynia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Blotting, Western;Chronic Pain;Cytokines;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Freund's Adjuvant;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression Regulation;Immunofluorescence;Inflammation;Injections, Intrathecal;Injections, Spinal;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Neurons;Oligopeptides;Opioid Peptides;Opioids;Pain;Pain Threshold;Pain, Postoperative;Phosphorylation;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Production;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Regulation;Reverse Transcription;Signal Transduction;Staining;Therapeutics;Time;Time Factors;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",J Neuroinflammation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
30524245,2018,Mineralocorticoid Antagonist Improves Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling and Dexamethasone Analgesia in an Animal Model of Low Back Pain.,"Low back pain, a leading cause of disability, is commonly treated by epidural steroid injections that target the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, their efficacy has been controversial. All currently used epidural steroids also activate the pro-inflammatory mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) with significant potency. Local inflammation of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a rat model of low back pain, was used. This model causes static and dynamic mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia and guarding behavior (a measure of spontaneous pain), and activates the MR, with pro-nociceptive effects. In this study, effects of local Dexamethasone (DEX; a glucocorticoid used in epidural injections), and eplerenone (EPL; a second generation, more selective MR antagonist) applied to the DRG at the time of inflammation were examined. Mechanical and spontaneous pain behaviors were more effectively reduced by the combination of DEX and EPL than by either alone. The combination of steroids was particularly more effective than DEX alone or the model alone (3-fold improvement for mechanical allodynia) at later times (day 14). Immunohistochemical analysis of the GR in the DRG showed that the receptor was expressed in neurons of all size classes, and in non-neuronal cells including satellite glia. The GR immunoreactivity was downregulated by DRG inflammation (48%) starting on day 1, consistent with the reduction of GR (57%) observed by Western blot, when compared to control animals. On day 14, the combination of DEX and EPL resulted in rescue of GR immunoreactivity that was not seen with DEX alone, and was more effective in reducing a marker for satellite glia activation/neuroinflammation. The results suggest that EPL may enhance the effectiveness of clinically used epidural steroid injections, in part by enhancing the availability of the GR. Thus, the glucocorticoid-mineralocorticoid interactions may limit the effectiveness of epidural steroids through the regulation of the GR in the DRG.","Allodynia;Analgesia;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Back Pain;Behavior;Blot, Western;Cells;Cold Temperature;Dexamethasone;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Eplerenone;Ganglia, Spinal;Generations;Glucocorticoids;Inflammation;Injections;Injections, Epidural;Low Back Pain;Measures;Mechanical Allodynia;Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists;Mineralocorticoids;Models, Animal;Neurons;Pain;Rats;Receptors, Glucocorticoid;Receptors, Mineralocorticoid;Regulation;Satellite Glia;Steroids;Time",Allodynia;Back Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Low Back Pain;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain,Front Cell Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
30699332,2019,Role of NaV1.6 and NaVβ4 Sodium Channel Subunits in a Rat Model of Low Back Pain Induced by Compression of the Dorsal Root Ganglia.,"Low back pain is a common cause of chronic pain and disability. It is modeled in rodents by chronically compressing the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with small metal rods, resulting in ipsilateral mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, and hyperexcitability of sensory neurons. Sodium channels are implicated in this hyperexcitability, but the responsible isoforms are unknown. In this study, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of the pore-forming NaV1.6 and regulatory NaVβ4 sodium channel isoforms that have been previously implicated in a different model of low back pain caused by locally inflaming the L5 DRG. Knockdown of either subunit markedly reduced spontaneous pain and mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced by DRG compression, and reduced spontaneous activity and hyperexcitability of sensory neurons with action potentials &lt;1.5 msec (predominately cells with myelinated axons, based on conduction velocities measured in a subset of cells) 4 days after DRG compression. These results were similar to those previously obtained in the DRG inflammation model and some neuropathic pain models, in which sensory neurons other than nociceptors seem to play key roles. The cytokine profiles induced by DRG compression and DRG inflammation were also very similar, with upregulation of several type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of type 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines. Surprisingly, the cytokine profile was largely unaffected by NaVβ4 knockdown in either model. The NaV1.6 channel, and the NaVβ4 subunit that can regulate NaV1.6 to enhance repetitive firing, play key roles in both models of low back pain; targeting the abnormal spontaneous activity they generate may have therapeutic value.","Action Potentials;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Axons;Cells;Chronic Pain;Cold Temperature;Cytokines;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Down-Regulation;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Low Back Pain;Male;Metals;Models, Animal;NAV1.6 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel;Neuralgia;Neurons;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain Threshold;Play;Protein Isoforms;RNA, Small Interfering;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Rodentia;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sodium Channels;Spinal Cord Compression;Sympathetic Nervous System;Therapeutics;Up-Regulation;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel beta-4 Subunit",Chronic Pain;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Low Back Pain;Neuralgia;Pain;Spinal Cord Compression,Neuroscience,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
30915992,2019,"High-dose naloxone, an experimental tool uncovering latent sensitisation: pharmacokinetics in humans.","Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, is used as a pharmacological tool to detect tonic endogenous activation of opioid receptors in experimental pain models. We describe a pharmacokinetic model linking naloxone pharmacokinetics to its main metabolite after high-dose naloxone infusion. Eight healthy volunteers received a three-stage stepwise high-dose i.v. naloxone infusion (total dose 3.25 mg kg-1). Naloxone and naloxone-3-glucuronide (N3G) plasma concentrations were sampled from infusion onset to 334 min after infusion discontinuation. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effect models (NONMEM). The predictive performances of Dowling's and Yassen's models were evaluated, and target-controlled infusion simulations were performed. Three- and two-compartment disposition models with linear elimination kinetics described the naloxone and N3G concentration time-courses, respectively. Two covariate models were developed: simple (weight proportional) and complex (with the shallow peripheral volume of distribution linearly increasing with body weight). The median prediction error (MDPE) and wobble for Dowling's model were -32.5% and 33.4%, respectively. For Yassen's model, the MDPE and wobble were 1.2% and 19.9%, respectively. A parent-metabolite pharmacokinetic model was developed for naloxone and N3G after high-dose naloxone infusion. No saturable pharmacokinetics were observed. Whereas Dowling's model was inaccurate and over-predicted naloxone concentrations, Yassen's model accurately predicted naloxone pharmacokinetics. The newly developed covariate models may be used for high-dose TCI-naloxone for experimental and clinical practice.

30937216,2019,Latent Sensitization in a Mouse Model of Ocular Neuropathic Pain.,"Chronic ocular pain is poorly understood and difficult to manage. We developed a murine model of corneal surface injury (CSI)-induced chronic ocular neuropathic pain. The study focuses on changes in corneal nerve morphology and associated short- and long-term pain-like behavior after CSI. CSI was induced in mice by local application of an alkali solution (0.75 N NaOH). Corneal nerve architecture, morphology, density, and length were studied. Eye-wiping was evaluated before and after CSI in response to hypertonic saline (2 M NaCl). Naltrexone (NTX) or Naloxone-methiodide (NLX-me), opioid receptor antagonists, were given subcutaneously (s.c., 3 mg/kg) or topically (eye drop, 100 μM), and then an eye-wiping test was performed. CSI caused partial corneal deinnervation followed by gradual reinnervation. Regenerated nerves displayed increased tortuosity, beading, and branching. CSI enhanced hypertonic saline-induced eye-wiping behavior compared to baseline or sham-injury (P &lt; 0.01). This hypersensitivity peaked at 10 days and subsided 14 days after CSI. Administration of NTX, or NLX-me, a selective peripheral opioid antagonist, reinstated eye-wiping behavior in the injury group, but not in the sham groups (P &lt; 0.05). This study introduces a model of chronic ocular pain and corneal neuropathy following CSI. CSI induces central and peripheral opioid receptor-dependent latent sensitization (LS) that is unmasked by systemic or topical administration of opioid antagonists. This model of chronic ocular pain establishes LS as a new inhibitory mechanism in the oculotrigeminal system and may be used for potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for ocular neuropathy.","AT 10;Administration;Administration, Topical;Alkalies;Architecture;Behavior;Eye;Eyedrops;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mice;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Neuralgia;News;Pain;Receptors, Opioid;Solutions;Therapeutics",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Transl Vis Sci Technol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
31076578,2019,Facilitation of neuropathic pain by the NPY Y1 receptor-expressing subpopulation of excitatory interneurons in the dorsal horn.,"Endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts long-lasting spinal inhibitory control of neuropathic pain, but its mechanism of action is complicated by the expression of its receptors at multiple sites in the dorsal horn: NPY Y1 receptors (Y1Rs) on post-synaptic neurons and both Y1Rs and Y2Rs at the central terminals of primary afferents. We found that Y1R-expressing spinal neurons contain multiple markers of excitatory but not inhibitory interneurons in the rat superficial dorsal horn. To test the relevance of this spinal population to the development and/or maintenance of acute and neuropathic pain, we selectively ablated Y1R-expressing interneurons with intrathecal administration of an NPY-conjugated saporin ribosomal neurotoxin that spares the central terminals of primary afferents. NPY-saporin decreased spinal Y1R immunoreactivity but did not change the primary afferent terminal markers isolectin B4 or calcitonin-gene-related peptide immunoreactivity. In the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, NPY-saporin decreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, but disrupted neither normal mechanical or thermal thresholds, motor coordination, nor locomotor activity. We conclude that Y1R-expressing excitatory dorsal horn interneurons facilitate neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, this neuronal population remains sensitive to intrathecal NPY after nerve injury. This neuroanatomical and behavioral characterization of Y1R-expressing excitatory interneurons provides compelling evidence for the development of spinally-directed Y1R agonists to reduce chronic neuropathic pain.","Administration;Animals;Axons;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cold Temperature;Hypersensitivity;Injections, Spinal;Injuries;Interneurons;Isolectins;Locomotion;Maintenance;Male;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neuropeptide Y;Neurotoxins;Pain Measurement;Population;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Neuropeptide;Saporins;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Sci Rep,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
31335645,2019,An NPY Y1 receptor antagonist unmasks latent sensitization and reveals the contribution of protein kinase A and Epac to chronic inflammatory pain.,"Peripheral inflammation produces a long-lasting latent sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons, that is, masked by tonic inhibitory controls. We explored mechanisms of latent sensitization with an established four-step approach: (1) induction of inflammation; (2) allow pain hypersensitivity to resolve; (3) interrogate latent sensitization with a channel blocker, mutant mouse, or receptor antagonist; and (4) disrupt compensatory inhibition with a receptor antagonist so as to reinstate pain hypersensitivity. We found that the neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 reinstated pain hypersensitivity, indicative of an unmasking of latent sensitization. BIBO3304-evoked reinstatement was not observed in AC1 knockout mice and was prevented with intrathecal co-administration of a pharmacological blocker to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1), protein kinase A (PKA), transient receptor potential cation channel A1 (TRPA1), channel V1 (TRPV1), or exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac1 or Epac2). A PKA activator evoked both pain reinstatement and touch-evoked pERK expression in dorsal horn; the former was prevented with intrathecal co-administration of a TRPA1 or TRPV1 blocker. An Epac activator also evoked pain reinstatement and pERK expression. We conclude that PKA and Epac are sufficient to maintain long-lasting latent sensitization of dorsal horn neurons that is kept in remission by the NPY-Y1 receptor system. Furthermore, we have identified and characterized 2 novel molecular signaling pathways in the dorsal horn that drive latent sensitization in the setting of chronic inflammatory pain: NMDAR→AC1→PKA→TRPA1/V1 and NMDAR→AC1→Epac1/2. New treatments for chronic inflammatory pain might either increase endogenous NPY analgesia or inhibit AC1, PKA, or Epac.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Adenylyl Cyclases;Administration;Analgesia;Animals;Arginine;Chronic Pain;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Drive;Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Neuropeptide Y;News;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain Threshold;Phosphorylation;Posterior Horn Cells;Proteins;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate;Receptors, Neuropeptide Y;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;TRPA1 Cation Channel;Therapeutics;Touch;Transient Receptor Potential Channels",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
31351975,2020,Sex differences in kappa opioid receptor inhibition of latent postoperative pain sensitization in dorsal horn.,"Tissue injury produces a delicate balance between latent pain sensitization (LS) and compensatory endogenous opioid receptor analgesia that continues for months, even after re-establishment of normal pain thresholds. To evaluate the contribution of mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and/or kappa (KOR) opioid receptors to the silencing of chronic postoperative pain, we performed plantar incision at the hindpaw, waited 21 days for the resolution of hyperalgesia, and then intrathecally injected subtype-selective ligands. We found that the MOR-selective inhibitor CTOP (1-1000 ng) dose-dependently reinstated mechanical hyperalgesia. Two DOR-selective inhibitors naltrindole (1-10 μg) and TIPP[Ψ] (1-20 μg) reinstated mechanical hyperalgesia, but only at the highest dose that also produced itching, licking, and tail biting. Both the prototypical KOR-selective inhibitors nor-BNI (0.1-10 μg) and the newer KOR inhibitor with more canonical pharmocodynamic effects, LY2456302 (0.1-10 μg), reinstated mechanical hyperalgesia. Furthermore, LY2456302 (10 μg) increased the expression of phosphorylated signal-regulated kinase (pERK), a marker of central sensitization, in dorsal horn neurons but not glia. Sex studies revealed that LY2456302 (0.3 μg) reinstated hyperalgesia and pERK expression to a greater degree in female as compared to male mice. Our results suggest that spinal MOR and KOR, but not DOR, maintain LS within a state of remission to reduce the intensity and duration of postoperative pain, and that endogenous KOR but not MOR analgesia is greater in female mice.","Analgesia;Animals;Benzamides;Central Nervous System Sensitization;Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases;Female;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Ligands;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Naltrexone;Neuroglia;Pain;Pain Threshold;Pain, Postoperative;Phosphotransferases;Posterior Horn Cells;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Pruritus;Pyrrolidines;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Somatostatin;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Tail;Tissues","Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Pruritus",Neuropharmacology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment

Prospective, consecutive cohort study including patients with pain-related impairment of physical and social life. Relevant surgical records were obtained, and examinations were by standardized clinical and neurophysiological tests. Patients demonstrating pain sensitivity to pressure algometry in the operated groin underwent re-surgery, while patients with neuropathic pain received pharmacotherapy. Questionnaires at baseline (Q0) and at the 5-year time point (Q5Y) were used in outcome analyses of pain intensity (numeric rating scale [NRS] 0-10) and pain-related effect on the activity-of-daily-living (Activities Assessment Scale [AAS]). Data are mean (95% CI).Analyses were made in 172/204 (84%) eligible patients. In 54/172 (31%) patients re-surgery (meshectomy/selective neurectomy) was performed, while the remaining 118/172 (69%) patients received pharmacotherapy. In the re-surgery group, activity-related, and average NRS-scores at Q0 were 6.6 (5.6-7.9) and 5.9 (5.6-5.9), respectively. Correspondingly, NRS-scores at Q5Y was 4.1 (3.3-5.1) and 3.1 (2.3-4.0; Q0 vs. Q5Y: P &lt; .0005), respectively.

31707979,2019,Paclitaxel-activated astrocytes produce mechanical allodynia in mice by releasing tumor necrosis factor-α and stromal-derived cell factor 1.,"Paclitaxel is a widely used and potent chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. However, patients receiving paclitaxel often develop an acute pain syndrome for which there are few treatment options. Astrocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of pain in multiple preclinical models, as well as in paclitaxel-treated rodents. However, it is still unclear what the exact contribution of astrocytes may be in paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS). P-APS was modeled by a single systemic or intrathecal injection of paclitaxel and astrocyte contribution tested by immunohistochemical, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches. Cell cultures were also prepared to assess whether paclitaxel treatment directly activates astrocytes and whether intrathecal injection of paclitaxel-treated astrocytes produces pain that is reminiscent of P-APS. Systemic injection of paclitaxel resulted in increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (a common marker of astrocytic activation), as well as both systemic or intrathecal injection of paclitaxel induced pain hypersensitivity indicated by the development of mechanical allodynia, which was significantly reversed by the astrocytic inhibitor L-α-AA. Cultured astrocytes were activated by paclitaxel with significant increases in protein levels for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and stromal-derived cell factor 1 (SDF-1). Importantly, intrathecal injection of paclitaxel-activated astrocytes produced mechanical allodynia that was reversed by TNF-α and SDF-1 neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest for the first time that paclitaxel can directly activate astrocytes, which are sufficient to produce acute pain by releasing TNF-α and SDF-1. Targeting astrocytes and these cytokines may offer new treatments for P-APS.","Acute Pain;Animals;Antibodies, Neutralizing;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Astrocytes;Cancer;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Chemokine CXCL12;Cytokines;Female;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections;Injections, Intrathecal;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;News;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Play;Proteins;Rodentia;Role;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Time;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Acute Pain;Cancer;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Necrosis;Neoplasms;Pain;Syndrome,J Neuroinflammation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
31990732,2020,Differential Regulation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor in a Rat Model of Inflammatory Pain.,"Anti-inflammatory corticosteroids are a common treatment for different conditions involving chronic pain and inflammation. Clinically used steroids target the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) for its anti-inflammatory effects. We previously reported that GR in sensory neurons may play central roles in some pain models and that GR immunoreactivity signal in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) decreased after local inflammation of the DRG (a model of low back pain). In the current study, we aimed to determine if similar changes in GR signal also exist in a skin inflammation model, the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model (a model of peripheral inflammatory pain), in which the terminals of the sensory neurons rather than the somata are inflamed. A low dose of CFA was injected into the hind paw to establish the peripheral inflammation model in Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, as confirmed by measurements of behavior and paw swelling. Immunohistochemical and western blotting techniques were used to determine the expression pattern of the GR in the inflamed hind paw and the DRGs. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured with radioimmunoassay. The immunohistochemical staining revealed that GR is widely expressed in the normal DRG and skin tissues. Paw injection with CFA caused upregulation of the GR in the skin tissue on postinjection day 1, mostly detected in the dermis area. However, paw inflammation significantly reduced the GR signal in the L5 DRG 1 day after the injection. The GR downregulation was still evident 14 days after CFA inflammation. On day 1, western blotting confirmed this downregulation and showed that it could also be observed in the contralateral L5 DRG, as well as in the L2 DRG (a level which does not innervate the paw). Plasma corticosterone levels were elevated in both sexes on day 14 after CFA compared to day 1, suggesting autologous downregulation of the GR by corticosterone may have contributed to the downregulation observed on day 14 but not day 1. There are distinctive patterns of GR activation under different pain conditions, depending on the anatomical location. The observed downregulation of the GR in sensory neurons may have a significant impact on the use of steroids as treatment in these conditions and on the regulatory effects of endogenous glucocorticoids.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Behavior;Blotting, Western;Chronic Pain;Corticosterone;Dermis;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Down-Regulation;Female;Freund's Adjuvant;Ganglia, Spinal;Glucocorticoids;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Injections;Low Back Pain;Male;Pain;Plasma;Play;Radioimmunoassay;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Glucocorticoid;Regulation;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex;Skin;Soma;Staining;Steroids;Therapeutics;Tissues;Up-Regulation",Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Low Back Pain;Pain,Anesth Analg,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
32058598,2020,Role of 1-Deoxysphingolipids in docetaxel neurotoxicity.,"A major dose-limiting side effect of docetaxel chemotherapy is peripheral neuropathy. Patients' symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling and burning sensations, and motor weakness in the extremities. The molecular mechanism is currently not understood, and there are no treatments available. Previously, we have shown an association between neuropathy symptoms of patients treated with paclitaxel and the plasma levels of neurotoxic sphingolipids, the 1-deoxysphingolipids (1-deoxySL) (Kramer et al, FASEB J, 2015). 1-DeoxySL are produced when the first enzyme of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), uses L-alanine as a substrate instead of its canonical amino acid substrate, L-serine. In the current investigation, we tested whether 1-deoxySL accumulate in the nervous system following systemic docetaxel treatment in mice. In dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we observed that docetaxel (45 mg/kg cumulative dose) significantly elevated the levels of 1-deoxySL and L-serine-derived ceramides, but not sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive sphingolipid and a ligand for specific G-protein-coupled receptors. In the sciatic nerve, docetaxel decreased 1-deoxySL and ceramides. Moreover, we show that in primary DRG cultures, 1-deoxysphingosine produced neurite swellings that could be reversed with S1P. Our results demonstrate that docetaxel chemotherapy up-regulates sphingolipid metabolism in sensory neurons, leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic 1-deoxySL. We suggest that the neurotoxic effects of 1-deoxySL on axons can be reversed with S1P.","Alanine;Amino Acids;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic;Association;Axons;Biosynthetic Pathways;Ceramides;Culture;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Docetaxel;Drug Therapy;Enzymes;Extremities;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Hypesthesia;Ligands;Lipids;Lysophospholipids;Metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Nervous System;Neurites;Neurotoxicity Syndromes;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phosphates;Plasma;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Role;Sciatic Nerve;Sensation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Serine;Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase;Sphingolipids;Sphingosine;Therapeutics",Hypesthesia;Neurotoxicity Syndromes;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,J Neurochem,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
32145934,2020,Neuropeptide Y tonically inhibits an NMDAR➔AC1➔TRPA1/TRPV1 mechanism of the affective dimension of chronic neuropathic pain.,"Transection of the sural and common peroneal branches of the sciatic nerve produces cutaneous hypersensitivity at the tibial innervation territory of the mouse hindpaw that resolves within a few weeks. We report that interruption of endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling during remission, with either conditional NPY knockdown in NPYtet/tet mice or intrathecal administration of the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304, reinstated hypersensitivity. These data indicate that nerve injury establishes a long-lasting latent sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons that is masked by spinal NPY-Y1 neurotransmission. To determine whether this mechanism extends beyond the sensory component of nociception, we used conditioned place aversion and preference assays to evaluate the affective component of pain. We found that BIBO3304 produced place aversion in mice when administered during remission. Furthermore, the analgesic drug gabapentin produced place preference after NPY knockdown in NPYtet/tet but not control mice. We then used pharmacological agents and deletion mutant mice to investigate the cellular mechanisms of neuropathic latent sensitization. BIBO3304-induced reinstatement of mechanical hypersensitivity and conditioned place aversion could be prevented with intrathecal administration of an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist (MK-801) and was absent in adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) deletion mutant mice. BIBO3304-induced reinstatement could also be prevented with intrathecal administration an AC1 inhibitor (NB001) or a TRPV1 channel blocker (AMG9801), but not vehicle. Intrathecal administration of a TRPA1 channel blocker (HC030031) prevented the reinstatement of neuropathic hypersensitivity produced either by BIBO3304, or by NPY knockdown in NPYtet/tet but not control mice. Our results confirm new mediators of latent sensitization: TRPA1 and TRPV1. We conclude that NPY acts at spinal Y1 to tonically inhibit a molecular NMDAR➔AC1 intracellular signaling pathway in the dorsal horn that is induced by peripheral nerve injury and drives both the sensory and affective components of chronic neuropathic pain.","Adenylyl Cyclases;Administration;Analgesics;Animals;Drive;Gabapentin;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;MK-801;Male;Mice;Neuralgia;Neuropeptide Y;News;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Posterior Horn Cells;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate;Receptors, Neuropeptide Y;Report;Sciatic Nerve;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Synaptic Transmission;TRPA1 Cation Channel",Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Neuropeptides,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
32770848,2021,Spinal Cord Stimulation Attenuates Below-Level Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Rats After Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury.,"The burden of pain after spinal cord injury (SCI), which may occur above, at, or below injury level, is high worldwide. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an important neuromodulation pain therapy, but its efficacy in SCI pain remains unclear. In SCI rats, we tested whether conventional SCS (50 Hz, 80% motor threshold [MoT]) and 1200 Hz, low-intensity SCS (40% MoT) inhibit hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity, and whether conventional SCS attenuates evoked responses of wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons in lumbar spinal cord. Male rats underwent a moderate contusive injury at the T9 vertebral level. Six to eight weeks later, SCS or sham stimulation (120 min, n = 10) was delivered through epidural miniature electrodes placed at upper-lumbar spinal cord, with using a crossover design. Mechanical hypersensitivity was examined in awake rats by measuring paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to stimulation with von Frey filaments. WDR neurons were recorded with in vivo electrophysiologic methods in a separate study of anesthetized rats. Both conventional SCS and 1200 Hz SCS increased PWTs from prestimulation level in SCI rats, but the effects were modest and short-lived. Sham SCS was not effective. Conventional SCS (10 min) at an intensity that evokes the peak Aα/β waveform of sciatic compound action potential did not inhibit WDR neuronal responses (n = 19) to graded or repeated electrical stimulation that induces windup. Conventional SCS and 1200 Hz, low-intensity SCS modestly attenuated below-level mechanical hypersensitivity after SCI. Inhibition of WDR neurons was not associated with pain inhibition from conventional SCS.","Action Potentials;Animals;Cross-Over Design;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Male;Methods;Neurons;Pain;Posterior Horn Cells;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Injuries;Spinal Cord Stimulation;Therapeutics",Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain;Spinal Cord Injuries,Neuromodulation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
32903062,2021,Evaluation of green light exposure on headache frequency and quality of life in migraine patients: A preliminary one-way cross-over clinical trial.,"Pharmacological management of migraine can be ineffective for some patients. We previously demonstrated that exposure to green light resulted in antinociception and reversal of thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in rodent pain models. Given the safety of green light emitting diodes, we evaluated green light as a potential therapy in patients with episodic or chronic migraine. We recruited (29 total) patients, of whom seven had episodic migraine and 22 had chronic migraine. We used a one-way cross-over design consisting of exposure for 1-2 hours daily to white light emitting diodes for 10 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period followed by exposure for 1-2 hours daily to green light emitting diodes for 10 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue current therapies and to initiate new treatments as directed by their physicians. Outcomes consisted of patient-reported surveys. The primary outcome measure was the number of headache days per month. Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported changes in the intensity and frequency of the headaches over a two-week period and other quality of life measures including ability to fall and stay asleep, and ability to perform work. Changes in pain medications were obtained to assess potential reduction. When seven episodic migraine and 22 chronic migraine patients were analyzed as separate cohorts, white light emitting diodes produced no significant change in headache days in either episodic migraine or chronic migraine patients. Combining data from the episodic migraine and chronic migraine groups showed that white light emitting diodes produced a small, but statistically significant reduction in headache days from (days ± SEM) 18.2 ± 1.8 to 16.5 ± 2.01 days. Green light emitting diodes resulted in a significant decrease in headache days from 7.9 ± 1.6 to 2.4 ± 1.1 and from 22.3 ± 1.2 to 9.4 ± 1.6 in episodic migraine and chronic migraine patients, respectively. While some improvement in secondary outcomes was observed with white light emitting diodes, more secondary outcomes with significantly greater magnitude including assessments of quality of life, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Headache Impact Test-6, and Five-level version of the EuroQol five-dimensional survey without reported side effects were observed with green light emitting diodes. Conclusions regarding pain medications reduction with green light emitting diode exposure were not possible. No side effects of light therapy were reported. None of the patients in the study reported initiation of new therapies. Green light emitting diodes significantly reduced the number of headache days in people with episodic migraine or chronic migraine. Additionally, green light emitting diodes significantly improved multiple secondary outcome measures including quality of life and intensity and duration of the headache attacks. As no adverse events were reported, green light emitting diodes may provide a treatment option for those patients who prefer non-pharmacological therapies or may be considered in complementing other treatment strategies. Limitations of this study are the small number of patients evaluated. The positive data obtained support implementation of larger clinical trials to determine possible effects of green light emitting diode therapy.This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov under NCT03677206.",Ability;Accidental Falls;Clinical Trial;Cross-Over Design;Cross-Over Studies;Form;Headache;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Light;McGill Pain Questionnaire;Measures;Methyl Green;Migraine Disorders;News;Outcome Measures;Pain;Patients;Persons;Phototherapy;Physicians;Quality of Life;Rodentia;Safety;Surveys;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Whites;Work,Headache;Hypersensitivity;Migraine Disorders;Pain,Cephalalgia,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
32929856,2021,Outcomes Associated With Infection of Chronic Pain Spinal Implantable Electronic Devices: Insights From a Nationwide Inpatient Sample Study.,"Chronic pain spinal implantable electronic devices (CPSIEDs) include devices that provide spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal drug therapy. In this study, we sought to evaluate the trends of CPSIED infections, related complications, and outcomes following the treatment of infection. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database contains data from 48 states, and the District of Columbia was used to identify patients with a primary diagnosis of CPSIED infection during the years 2005-2014. Patients with intrathecal pumps for the treatment of spasticity were excluded to limit the study population to patients with chronic pain disorders. Treatments were categorized as: 1) without device removal, 2) pulse generator or pump only removal, 3) intrathecal pump system removal, and 4) spinal cord stimulation system removal. Complications associated with CPSIED infections were identified using administrative billing codes. During the study period 2005-2014, a total of 11,041 patients were admitted to the hospital with CPSIED infections. The majority of the patients were treated without surgical intervention (56%), and a smaller proportion underwent complete system explantation (22.7%). In-hospital mortality or permanent disability due to paralysis after CPSIED infection was around 1.83% and 2.77%, respectively. Infectious complications such as meningitis, abscess formation, and osteomyelitis occurred in 4.93%, 5.08%, and 1.5%, respectively. The median cost of hospitalization was around US $14,118.00, and the median length of stay was approximately six days (interquartile range = 4-13 days). The complications of CPSIED infection were higher among patients that did not undergo device removal.","Abscess;Chronic Pain;Cost;Database;Device Removal;Devices;Diagnosis;District of Columbia;Drug Therapy;Electronics;Hospital Mortality;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Infections;Infusion Pumps, Implantable;Inpatients;Length of Stay;Meningitis;Muscle Spasticity;Osteomyelitis;Paralysis;Patients;Population;Pulse;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Stimulation;Therapeutics",Abscess;Chronic Pain;Infections;Meningitis;Muscle Spasticity;Osteomyelitis;Paralysis,Neuromodulation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33009246,2021,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein co-opts VEGF-A/neuropilin-1 receptor signaling to induce analgesia.,"Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues unabated. Binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2's spike protein to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including the neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). Because both spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)-a pronociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested whether spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuron firing was blocked by spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pronociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked through suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A ""silencing"" of pain through subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.","Analgesia;Angiogenesis Factor;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2;Behavior;Cell Movement;Disease;Humans;Neuralgia;Neuropilin-1;Pain;Pain Measurement;Proteins;SARS-CoV-2;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A;Virus Internalization",Neuralgia;Pain;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33110031,2021,Ubiquitin-mediated receptor degradation contributes to development of tolerance to MrgC agonist-induced pain inhibition in neuropathic rats.,"Agonists to subtype C of the Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptors (MrgC) induce pain inhibition after intrathecal (i.t.) administration in rodent models of nerve injury. Here, we investigated whether tolerance develops after repeated MrgC agonist treatments and examined the underlying mechanisms. In animal behavior studies conducted in male rats at 4 to 5 weeks after an L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL), the ability of dipeptide MrgC agonist JHU58 (0.1 mM, 10 μL, i.t.) to inhibit mechanical and heat hypersensitivity decreased after 3 days of treatment with a tolerance-inducing dose (0.5 mM, 10 μL, i.t., twice/day). In HEK293T cells, acute treatment with JHU58 or BAM8-22 (a large peptide MrgC agonist) led to MrgC endocytosis from the cell membrane and later sorting to the membrane for reinsertion. However, chronic exposure to JHU58 increased the coupling of MrgC to β-arrestin-2 and led to the ubiquitination and degradation of MrgC. Importantly, pretreatment with TAK-243 (0.2 mM, 5 μL, i.t.), a small-molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, during tolerance induction attenuated the development of tolerance to JHU58-induced inhibition of mechanical and heat hypersensitivity in SNL rats. Interestingly, morphine analgesia was also decreased in SNL rats that had become tolerant to JHU58, suggesting a cross-tolerance. Furthermore, i.t. pretreatment with TAK-243, which reduced JHU58 tolerance, also attenuated the cross-tolerance to morphine analgesia. These findings suggest that tolerance can develop to MrgC agonist-induced pain inhibition after repeated i.t. administrations. This tolerance development to JHU58 may involve increased coupling of MrgC to β-arrestin-2 and ubiquitin-mediated receptor degradation.","Ability;Administration;Analgesia;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Cell Membrane;Dipeptides;Endocytosis;Ganglia, Spinal;HEK293 Cells;Heat;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Immune Tolerance;Injuries;Ligation;Male;Membranes;Morphine;Pain;Peptides;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Rodentia;Spinal Nerves;Therapeutics;Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes;Ubiquitination;Ubiquitins;beta-Arrestin 2",Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33155057,2021,Green Light Exposure Improves Pain and Quality of Life in Fibromyalgia Patients: A Preliminary One-Way Crossover Clinical Trial.,"Fibromyalgia is a functional pain disorder in which patients suffer from widespread pain and poor quality of life. Fibromyalgia pain and its impact on quality of life are not effectively managed with current therapeutics. Previously, in a preclinical rat study, we demonstrated that exposure to green light-emitting diodes (GLED) for 8 hours/day for 5 days resulted in antinociception and reversal of thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with models of injury-related pain. Given the safety of GLED and the ease of its use, our objective is to administer GLED as a potential therapy to patients with fibromyalgia. One-way crossover clinical trial. United States. We enrolled 21 adult patients with fibromyalgia recruited from the University of Arizona chronic pain clinic who were initially exposed to white light-emitting diodes and then were crossed over to GLED for 1 to 2 hours daily for 10 weeks. Data were collected by using paper surveys. When patients were exposed to GLED, but not white light-emitting diodes, they reported a significant reduction in average pain intensity on the 10-point numeric pain scale. Secondary outcomes were assessed by using the EQ-5D-5L survey, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and were also significantly improved in patients exposed to GLED. GLED therapy was not associated with any measured side effects in these patients.

33180816,2020,"High-dose naloxone: Effects by late administration on pain and hyperalgesia following a human heat injury model. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with an enriched enrollment design.","Severe chronic postsurgical pain has a prevalence of 4-10% in the surgical population. The underlying nociceptive mechanisms have not been well characterized. Following the late resolution phase of an inflammatory injury, high-dose μ-opioid-receptor inverse agonists reinstate hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. This unmasking of latent pain sensitization has been a consistent finding in rodents while only observed in a limited number of human volunteers. Latent sensitization could be a potential triggering venue in chronic postsurgical pain. The objective of the present trial was in detail to examine the association between injury-induced secondary hyperalgesia and naloxone-induced unmasking of latent sensitization. Healthy volunteers (n = 80) received a cutaneous heat injury (47°C, 420 s, 12.5 cm2). Baseline secondary hyperalgesia areas were assessed 1 h post-injury. Utilizing an enriched enrollment design, subjects with a magnitude of secondary hyperalgesia areas in the upper quartile ('high-sensitizers' [n = 20]) and the lower quartile ('low-sensitizers' [n = 20]) were selected for further study. In four consecutive experimental sessions (Sessions 1 to 4), the subjects at two sessions (Sessions 1 and 3) received a cutaneous heat injury followed 168 h later (Sessions 2 and 4) by a three-step target-controlled intravenous infusion of naloxone (3.25 mg/kg), or normal saline. Assessments of secondary hyperalgesia areas were made immediately before and stepwise during the infusions. Simple univariate statistics revealed no significant differences in secondary hyperalgesia areas between naloxone and placebo treatments (P = 0.215), or between 'high-sensitizers' and 'low-sensitizers' (P = 0.757). In a mixed-effects model, secondary hyperalgesia areas were significantly larger following naloxone as compared to placebo for 'high-sensitizers' (P &lt; 0.001), but not 'low-sensitizers' (P = 0.651). Although we could not unequivocally demonstrate naloxone-induced reinstatement of heat injury-induced hyperalgesia, further studies in clinical postsurgical pain models are warranted.","Administration;Association;Cross-Over Studies;Healthy Volunteers;Heat;Hot Temperature;Human Volunteers;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Infusions, Intravenous;Injuries;Male;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Nociception;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Placebos;Population;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Prevalence;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Rodentia;Saline Solution;Statistics;Therapeutics;Young Adult","Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic",PLoS One,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33204332,2020,Resolvin D3 controls mouse and human TRPV1-positive neurons and preclinical progression of psoriasis.,"Rationale: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a complex interplay between the immune and nervous systems with recurrent scaly skin plaques, thickened stratum corneum, infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells, and itch. Despite an increasing availability of immune therapies, they often have adverse effects, high costs, and dissociated effects on inflammation and itch. Activation of sensory neurons innervating the skin and TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) are emerging as critical components in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, but little is known about their endogenous inhibitors. Recent studies have demonstrated that resolvins, endogenous lipid mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids, are potent inhibitors of TRP channels and may offer new therapies for psoriasis without known adverse effects. Methods: We used behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical approaches to investigate the therapeutic effects of resolvin D3 (RvD3), a novel family member of resolvins, in a preclinical model of psoriasis consisting of repeated topical applications of imiquimod (IMQ) to murine skin, which provokes inflammatory lesions that resemble human psoriasis. Results: We report that RvD3 specifically reduced TRPV1-dependent acute pain and itch in mice. Mechanistically, RvD3 inhibited capsaicin-induced TRPV1 currents in dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via the N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (i.e. ALX/FPR2), a G-protein coupled receptor. Single systemic administration of RvD3 (2.8 mg/kg) reversed itch after IMQ, and repeated administration largely prevented the development of both psoriasiform itch and skin inflammation with concomitant decreased in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in DRG neurons. Accordingly, specific knockdown of CGRP in DRG was sufficient to prevent both psoriasiform itch and skin inflammation similar to the effects following RvD3 administration. Finally, we elevated the translational potential of this study by showing that RvD3 significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity and CGRP release in human DRG neurons. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a novel role for RvD3 in regulating TRPV1/CGRP in mouse and human DRG neurons and identify RvD3 and its neuronal pathways as novel therapeutic targets to treat psoriasis.","Acute Pain;Administration;Animals;Biopsy;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Capsaicin;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Cost;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease;Disease Models, Animal;Family Members;Fatty Acids, Omega-3;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Knockdown Techniques;Humans;Imiquimod;Inflammation;Lipids;Male;Methods;Mice;Nervous System;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neurons;News;Pain;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Primary Cell Culture;Pruritus;Psoriasis;Receptors, Formyl Peptide;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Report;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Skin;TRPV Cation Channels;Therapeutic Effects;Therapeutics;Transients",Acute Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Inflammation;Pain;Pruritus;Psoriasis,Theranostics,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33296535,2021,Modelling at-level allodynia after mid-thoracic contusion in the rat.,"The rat mid-thoracic contusion model has been used to study at-level tactile allodynia, a common type of pain that develops after spinal cord injury (SCI). An important advantage of this model is that not all animals develop hypersensitivity. Therefore, it can be used to examine mechanisms that are strictly related to the development of pain-like behaviour separately from mechanisms related to the injury itself. However, how to separate animals that develop hypersensitivity from those that do not is unclear. The aims of the current study were to identify where hypersensitivity and spasticity develop and use this information to identify metrics to separate animals that develop hypersensitivity from those that do not to study differences in their behaviour. To accomplish these aims, a grid was used to localize hypersensitivity on the dorsal trunk relative to thoracic dermatomes and supraspinal responses to tactile stimulation were tallied. These supraspinal responses were used to develop a hypersensitivity score to separate animals that develop hypersensitivity, or pain-like response to nonpainful stimuli. Similar to humans, the development of hypersensitivity could occur with the development of spasticity or hyperreflexia. Moreover, the time course and prevalence of hypersensitivity phenotypes (at-, above-, or below level) produced by this model were similar to that observed in humans with SCI. However, the amount of spared spinal matter in the cord did not explain the development of hypersensitivity, as previously reported. This approach can be used to study the mechanisms underlying the development of hypersensitivity separately from mechanisms related to injury alone.","Allodynia;Animals;Behavior;Benchmarks;Contusions;Disease Models, Animal;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Hyperreflexia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain;Phenotype;Prevalence;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Relatives;Spinal Cord Injuries;Tactile Allodynia;Time",Allodynia;Contusions;Hyperalgesia;Hyperreflexia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain;Spinal Cord Injuries;Tactile Allodynia,Eur J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33306248,2021,Adverse Events and Complications Associated With Intrathecal Drug Delivery Systems: Insights From the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.,"Modern intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are technologically advanced to deliver medication through various automated and patient-controlled programs. They also are associated with unique complications ranging from post-operative complications, medication-related adverse events (AE), device malfunction, to refill associated AE. To systematically analyze real-world complications and AE reported on the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE) associated with IDDS among patients predominantly with chronic pain disorders. MAUDE database was sampled for a month four times a year during the study period, February 2018 to February 2019. The database was resampled every six months till August 2020 to evaluate for any additional reported cases during the index months. The two FDA approved IDDS, were included. AE were broadly classified into causes related to catheter malfunction, pump malfunction, biologic, and medication-related AE. A total of 1001 reports were included in the final analysis. The top three reasons for adverse report are infection/erosion (15.7%, n = 157), motor stall (12.4%, n = 125) and adverse medication reactions (11.8%, n = 119), respectively. There were five deaths among patients with IDDS. Epidural hematoma (n = 3) after IDDS surgery resulted in a death and residual neurological deficits after surgical evacuation. Programming errors, medication concentration discrepancy, and failure to turn on the pump after reprogramming are various preventable causes of medication-related IDDS AEs. Analysis of AE associated with IDDS from the MAUDE database provided a real-world perspective different from reported registry complications. Awareness and vigilance of preventable IDDS-related complications is the first step toward mitigating risks to provide safe and effective intrathecal drug delivery for chronic pain management.","Awareness;Biopharmaceuticals;Catheters;Chronic Pain;Database;Databases, Factual;Death;Devices;Drug Delivery Systems;General Surgery;Hematoma;Humans;Index;Infections;Medication Errors;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Registries;Report;Risk;Time;United States Food and Drug Administration",Chronic Pain;Death;Hematoma;Infections,Neuromodulation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33470759,2021,Prostaglandin 15d-PGJ2 targets PPARγ and opioid receptors to prevent muscle hyperalgesia in rats.,"Pharmacological agents directed to either opioid receptors or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) at peripheral tissues reduce behavioral signs of persistent pain. Both receptors are expressed in muscle tissue, but the contribution of PPARγ activation to muscle pain and its modulation by opioid receptors remains unknown. To address this question, we first tested whether the endogenous PPARγ ligand 15d-PGJ2 would decrease mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan administration into the gastrocnemius muscle of rats. Next, we used receptor antagonists to determine whether the antihyperalgesic effect of 15-deoxyΔ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was PPARγ- or opioid receptor-dependent. Three hours after carrageenan, muscle hyperalgesia was quantified with the Randall-Selitto test. 15d-PGJ2 prevented carrageenan-induced muscle hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. The antihyperalgesic effect of 15d-PGJ2 was dose-dependently inhibited by either the PPARγ antagonist, 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide, or by the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. We conclude that 15d-PGJ2 targets PPARγ and opioid receptors to prevent muscle hyperalgesia. We suggest that local PPARγ receptors are important pharmacological targets for inflammatory muscle pain.","Address;Administration;Anilides;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Carrageenan;Gastrocnemius Muscle;Hyperalgesia;Immunologic Factors;Ligands;Mechanical Allodynia;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscles;Myalgia;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;PPAR gamma;Pain;Prostaglandin D2;Prostaglandins;Rats;Receptors, Opioid;Tissues",Hyperalgesia;Mechanical Allodynia;Myalgia;Pain,Neuroreport,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33591120,2021,Opioid Prescriptions by Pain Medicine Physicians in the Medicare Part D Program: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Pain medicine physicians (PMP) are a group of physicians with background training in various primary specialties with interest and expertise in managing chronic pain disorders. Our objective is to analyze prescription drug (PD) claims from the Medicare Part D program associated with PMP to gain insights into patterns, associated costs, and potential cost savings areas. The primary data source for Part D claims data is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, which contains Medicare Part D prescription drug events (PDE) records received through the claims submission cutoff date. Only providers with taxonomies of pain management (PM) and interventional pain management (IPM) were included in the study. The analysis of PDE was restricted to drugs with &gt;250 claims. The distribution of claims and costs were analyzed based on drug class and provider specialty. Subsequently, we explored claims and expenses for opioid drug prescriptions in detail. Prescribing characteristics of the top 5% of providers by costs and claims were examined to gain additional insights. The costs and claims were explored for the top 10 drugs prescribed by PMP in 2017. There were a total of unique 3280 PMP-prescribed drugs with an associated expense of 652 million dollars in the 2017 Medicare Part D program. Prescriptions related to PMP account for a tiny fraction of the program's drug expenditure (0.4%). Opioids, anticonvulsants, and gabapentinoids were associated with the largest number of claims and the largest expenses within this fraction. Among opioid drug prescriptions, brand-named drugs account for a small fraction of claims (8%) compared to generic drugs. However, the expenses associated with brand name drugs were higher than generic drugs. Prescribers in the top 5% by PD costs had a higher number of claims, prescribed a higher proportion of branded medications, and had prescriptions associated with longer day supply compared to an average PMP.

33768539,2021,Fast A-type currents shape a rapidly adapting form of delayed short latency firing of excitatory superficial dorsal horn neurons that express the neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor.,"Neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord contribute to chronic pain. For the first time, we characterized the firing patterns of Y1-expressing neurons in Y1eGFP reporter mice. Under hyperpolarized conditions, most Y1eGFP neurons exhibited fast A-type potassium currents and delayed, short-latency firing (DSLF). Y1eGFP DSLF neurons were almost always rapidly adapting and often exhibited rebound spiking, characteristics of spinal pain neurons under the control of T-type calcium channels. These results will inspire future studies to determine whether tissue or nerve injury downregulates the channels that underlie A-currents, thus unmasking membrane hyperexcitability in Y1-expressing dorsal horn neurons, leading to persistent pain. Neuroanatomical and behavioural evidence indicates that neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor-expressing interneurons (Y1-INs) in the superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are predominantly excitatory and contribute to chronic pain. Using an adult ex vivo spinal cord slice preparation from Y1eGFP reporter mice, we characterized firing patterns in response to steady state depolarizing current injection of GFP-positive cells in lamina II, the great majority of which expressed Y1 mRNA (88%). Randomly sampled (RS) and Y1eGFP neurons exhibited five firing patterns: tonic, initial burst, phasic, delayed short-latency &lt;180 ms (DSLF) and delayed long-latency &gt;180 ms (DLLF). When studied at resting membrane potential, most RS neurons exhibited delayed firing, while most Y1eGFP neurons exhibited phasic firing. A preconditioning membrane hyperpolarization produced only subtle changes in the firing patterns of RS neurons, but dramatically shifted Y1eGFP neurons to DSLF (46%) and DLLF (24%). In contrast to RS DSLF neurons, which rarely exhibited spike frequency adaptation, Y1eGFP DSLF neurons were almost always rapidly adapting, a characteristic of nociceptive-responsive SDH neurons. Rebound spiking was more prevalent in Y1eGFP neurons (6% RS vs. 32% Y1eGFP), indicating enrichment of T-type calcium currents. Y1eGFP DSLF neurons exhibited fast A-type potassium currents that are known to delay or limit action potential firing and exhibited smaller current density as compared to RS DSLF neurons. Our results will inspire future studies to determine whether tissue or nerve injury downregulates channels that contribute to A-currents, thus potentially unmasking T-type calcium channel activity and membrane hyperexcitability in Y1-INs, leading to persistent pain.","Action Potentials;Adult;Animals;Calcium;Calcium Channels, T-Type;Cells;Chronic Pain;Form;Future;Injections;Injuries;Interneurons;Membrane Potentials;Membranes;Mice;Neurons;Neuropeptide Y;Pain;Posterior Horn Cells;Potassium;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Neuropeptide Y;Resting Potentials;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Substantia Gelatinosa;Time;Tissues",Chronic Pain;Injuries;Pain,J Physiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33781493,2021,Sexual Dimorphism in the Expression of Pain Phenotype in Preclinical Models of Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis is one of most frequent rheumatic diseases, affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Pain impacting the quality of life for the patient with rheumatoid arthritis, is often the primary factor leading them to seek medical care. Although sex-related differences in humans and animal models of rheumatoid arthritis are described, the correlation between pain and sex in rheumatoid arthritis has only recently been directly examined. Here we review the literature and explore the mechanisms underlying the expression of the pain phenotype in females and males in preclinical models of rheumatoid arthritis.","Animals;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Female;Humans;Literature;Male;Models, Animal;Pain;Patients;Phenotype;Population;Quality of Life;Review;Rheumatic Diseases;Sex;Sex Characteristics","Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Pain;Rheumatic Diseases",Rheum Dis Clin North Am,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
33957003,2022,Endogenous µ-opioid receptor activity in the lateral and capsular subdivisions of the right central nucleus of the amygdala prevents chronic postoperative pain.,"Tissue injury induces a long-lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ-opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β-funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co-expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co-expressed tdTomato+ in Oprm1Cre ::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra-CeA injection of the MOR-selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.","Animals;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Cerebral Ventricles;Female;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injections;Injuries;Male;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Microinjections;Naloxone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Neurons;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Protein Kinase C-delta;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Tissues;Tomatoes","Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injuries;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic",J Neurosci Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34108435,2021,Protein kinase Cδ as a neuronal mechanism for headache in a chronic intermittent nitroglycerin model of migraine in mice.,"Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of typically throbbing and unilateral headaches, affecting up to 20% of the population worldwide. Despite the high prevalence and severity of this primary headache disorder, it remains to be a challenge to fully understand and treat migraine headaches. By characterizing and validating a mouse migraine model, this study aimed to investigate the functional contribution of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in migraine. In this study, we identified the presence of migraine-like ongoing pain in mice after chronic intermittent treatment with nitroglycerin (NTG). The peptide antagonist of calcitonin gene-related peptide α-CGRP (8-37), but not topiramate nor sumatriptan, effectively blocked ongoing pain and elicited pain relief-induced conditioned place preference in NTG-treated mice. Prominent activation of PKCδ was observed in chronic NTG-treated mice. Functional inhibition of PKCδ significantly attenuated ongoing spontaneous pain in chronic NTG-treated mice. Furthermore, we recapitulated the NTG-triggered migraine behavior in wild-type mice, but not in PKCδ-null mice. In response to repeated administration of NTG, ongoing spontaneous pain was not developed in mice lacking the specific PKC isoform. This study identified the presence of ongoing pain in mice treated with NTG, a known human migraine trigger that closely resembles the common manifestation of spontaneous migraine attacks in humans. These findings demonstrated a critical regulatory role of PKCδ in migraine pathophysiology, which may offer new pharmacological targets for antimigraine treatment.","Administration;Animals;Behavior;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Disease Models, Animal;Headache;Headache Disorders, Primary;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Mice;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;News;Nitroglycerin;Pain;Peptides;Population;Prevalence;Protein Isoforms;Protein Kinase C;Protein Kinase C-delta;Protein Kinases;Role;Sumatriptan;Therapeutics;Topiramate;Unilateral Headache;alpha-CGRP","Headache;Headache Disorders, Primary;Hyperalgesia;Migraine Disorders;Nervous System Diseases;Pain;Unilateral Headache",Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34157406,2021,Green Light Antinociceptive and Reversal of Thermal and Mechanical Hypersensitivity Effects Rely on Endogenous Opioid System Stimulation.,"Benefits of phototherapy were characterized in multiple diseases including depression, circadian rhythm disruptions, and neurodegeneration. Studies on migraine and fibromyalgia patients revealed that green light-emitting diodes (GLED) exposure provides a pragmatic and safe therapy to manage chronic pain. In rodents, GLED reversed hypersensitivity related to neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of GLED efficacy. Here, we sought to understand how green light modulates the endogenous opioid system. We first characterized how exposure to GLED stimulates release of β-endorphin and proenkephalin in the central nervous system of male rats. Moreover, by individually editing each of the receptors, we found that µ- and δ-opioid receptors are required for green light's antinociceptive effect in naïve rats and a model of HIV-induced peripheral neuropathy. We investigated how GLED could increase pain thresholds, and explored its potential in reversing hypersensitivity in a model of HIV-related neuropathy. Through behavioral and gene editing approaches, we identified that green light provides antinociception via modulation of the endogenous opioid system in the spinal cord. This work identifies a previously unknown mechanism by which GLED can improve pain management. Clinical translation of these results will advance the development of an innovative therapy devoid of adverse effects. PERSPECTIVE: Development of new pain management therapies, especially for HIV patients, is crucial as long-term opioid prescription is not recommended due to adverse side effects. Green light addresses this necessity. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms of this potentially groundbreaking and safe antinociceptive therapy will advance its clinical translation.","Address;Animals;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Circadian Rhythm;Depression;Disease;Disease Models, Animal;Enkephalins;Fibromyalgia;Gene Editing;HIV;Hypersensitivity;Innovative Therapies;Male;Methyl Green;Migraine Disorders;Neuralgia;News;Opioids;Pain Management;Pain Threshold;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phototherapy;Prescriptions;Protein Precursors;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Rodentia;Spinal Cord;Therapeutics;Translations;Work;beta-Endorphin",Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia;Hypersensitivity;Migraine Disorders;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,J Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34303780,2021,L5-6 Spinal Nerve Ligation-induced Neuropathy Changes the Location and Function of Ca2+ Channels and Cdk5 and Affects the Compound Action Potential in Adjacent Intact L4 Afferent Fibers.,"Voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels regulate multiple cell processes, including neurotransmitter release, and have been associated with several pathological conditions, such as neuropathic pain. Cdk5, a neuron-specific kinase, may phosphorylate CaV channels, altering their functional expression. During peripheral nerve injury, upregulation of CaV channels and Cdk5 in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord, has been correlated with allodynia. We recently reported an increase in the amplitude of the C component of the compound action potential (cAP) of afferent fibers in animals with allodynia induced by L5-6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL), recorded in the corresponding dorsal roots. This was related to an increase in T-type (CaV3.2) channels generated by Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation. Here, we show that CaV channel functional expression is also altered in the L4 adjacent intact afferent fibers in rats with allodynia induced by L5-6 SNL. Western blot analysis showed that both Cdk5 and CaV3.2 total levels are not increased in the DRG L3-4, but their subcellular distribution changes by concentrating on the neuronal soma. Likewise, the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine affected the rapid and the slow C components of the cAP recorded in the dorsal roots. Patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase in T- and N-type currents recorded in the soma of acute isolated L3-4 sensory neurons after L5-6 SNL, which was prevented by olomoucine. These findings suggest changes in CaV channels location and function in L3-4 afferent fibers associated with Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation after L5-6 SNL, which may contribute to nerve injury-induced allodynia.","Action Potentials;Affect;Allodynia;Animals;Blot, Western;Calcium Channels;Cells;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Dorsal Roots;Ganglia, Spinal;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Ligation;Neuralgia;Neurons;Neurons, Afferent;Neurotransmitters;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Sensory Receptor Cells;Soma;Spinal Cord;Spinal Nerves;Up-Regulation",Allodynia;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Neuralgia;Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Neuroscience,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34329326,2021,Methodology and applicability of the human contact burn injury model: A systematic review.,"The contact burn injury model is an experimental contact thermode-based physiological pain model primarily applied in research of drug efficacy in humans. The employment of the contact burn injury model across studies has been inconsistent regarding essential methodological variables, challenging the validity of the model. This systematic review analyzes methodologies, outcomes, and research applications of the contact burn injury model. Based on these results, we propose an improved contact burn injury testing paradigm. A literature search was conducted (15-JUL-2020) using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Sixty-four studies were included. The contact burn injury model induced consistent levels of primary and secondary hyperalgesia. However, the analyses revealed variations in the methodology of the contact burn injury heating paradigm and the post-burn application of test stimuli. The contact burn injury model had limited testing sensitivity in demonstrating analgesic efficacy. There was a weak correlation between experimental and clinical pain intensity variables. The data analysis was limited by the methodological heterogenicity of the different studies and a high risk of bias across the studies. In conclusion, although the contact burn injury model provides robust hyperalgesia, it has limited efficacy in testing analgesic drug response. Recommendations for future use of the model are being provided, but further research is needed to improve the sensitivity of the contact burn injury method. The protocol for this review has been published in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019133734).","Analgesics;Bias;Burns;Data Analysis;Employment;Female;Future;Heating;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Id;Injuries;Literature;Male;Methods;Models, Biological;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pharmaceutical Preparations;PubMed;Research;Review;Risk;Science;Sensitivity;Systematic Review",Burns;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Pain,PLoS One,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34446036,2021,Global gene expression and chromatin accessibility of the peripheral nervous system in animal models of persistent pain.,"Efforts to understand genetic variability involved in an individual's susceptibility to chronic pain support a role for upstream regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. To examine the transcriptomic and epigenetic basis of chronic pain that resides in the peripheral nervous system, we used RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of the rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to identify novel molecular pathways associated with pain hypersensitivity in two well-studied persistent pain models induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and intra-plantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. Our RNA-seq studies identify a variety of biological process related to synapse organization, membrane potential, transmembrane transport, and ion binding. Interestingly, genes that encode transcriptional regulators were disproportionately downregulated in both models. Our ATAC-seq data provide a comprehensive map of chromatin accessibility changes in the DRG. A total of 1123 regions showed changes in chromatin accessibility in one or both models when compared to the naïve and 31 shared differentially accessible regions (DAR)s. Functional annotation of the DARs identified disparate molecular functions enriched for each pain model which suggests that chromatin structure may be altered differently following sciatic nerve injury and hind paw inflammation. Motif analysis identified 17 DNA sequences known to bind transcription factors in the CCI DARs and 33 in the CFA DARs. Two motifs were significantly enriched in both models. Our improved understanding of the changes in chromatin accessibility that occur in chronic pain states may identify regulatory genomic elements that play essential roles in modulating gene expression in the DRG.","ATAC-Seq;Animals;Biological Processes;Chromatin;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Constriction;DNA Sequence;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Disease Models, Animal;Elements;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenetics;Freund's Adjuvant;Ganglia, Spinal;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetics;Genomics;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injections;Injuries;Ions;Male;Map;Membrane Potentials;Models, Animal;Organizations;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System;Play;RNA-Seq;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Regulation;Role;Sciatic Nerve;Synapses;Transcription Factors;Transcriptome",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Injuries;Pain,J Neuroinflammation,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34473953,2021,IL-23/IL-17A/TRPV1 axis produces mechanical pain via macrophage-sensory neuron crosstalk in female mice.,"Although sex dimorphism is increasingly recognized as an important factor in pain, female-specific pain signaling is not well studied. Here we report that administration of IL-23 produces mechanical pain (mechanical allodynia) in female but not male mice, and chemotherapy-induced mechanical pain is selectively impaired in female mice lacking Il23 or Il23r. IL-23-induced pain is promoted by estrogen but suppressed by androgen, suggesting an involvement of sex hormones. IL-23 requires C-fiber nociceptors and TRPV1 to produce pain but does not directly activate nociceptor neurons. Notably, IL-23 requires IL-17A release from macrophages to evoke mechanical pain in females. Low-dose IL-17A directly activates nociceptors and induces mechanical pain only in females. Finally, deletion of estrogen receptor subunit α (ERα) in TRPV1+ nociceptors abolishes IL-23- and IL-17-induced pain in females. These findings demonstrate that the IL-23/IL-17A/TRPV1 axis regulates female-specific mechanical pain via neuro-immune interactions. Our study also reveals sex dimorphism at both immune and neuronal levels.","Administration;Androgens;Animals;C Fibers;Cells, Cultured;Drug Therapy;Estrogen Receptor alpha;Estrogens;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Humans;Interleukin-17;Interleukin-17A;Interleukin-23;Macrophages;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated;Neuroimmunomodulation;Neurons;Nociceptive Pain;Nociceptors;Pain;Primates;Receptors, Estrogen;Report;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Signal Transduction;TRPV Cation Channels",Ganglion Cysts;Mechanical Allodynia;Nociceptive Pain;Pain,Neuron,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34707084,2021,Repurposing cancer drugs identifies kenpaullone which ameliorates pathologic pain in preclinical models via normalization of inhibitory neurotransmission.,"Inhibitory GABA-ergic neurotransmission is fundamental for the adult vertebrate central nervous system and requires low chloride concentration in neurons, maintained by KCC2, a neuroprotective ion transporter that extrudes intracellular neuronal chloride. To identify Kcc2 gene expression‑enhancing compounds, we screened 1057 cell growth-regulating compounds in cultured primary cortical neurons. We identified kenpaullone (KP), which enhanced Kcc2/KCC2 expression and function in cultured rodent and human neurons by inhibiting GSK3ß. KP effectively reduced pathologic pain-like behavior in mouse models of nerve injury and bone cancer. In a nerve-injury pain model, KP restored Kcc2 expression and GABA-evoked chloride reversal potential in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Delta-catenin, a phosphorylation-target of GSK3ß in neurons, activated the Kcc2 promoter via KAISO transcription factor. Transient spinal over-expression of delta-catenin mimicked KP analgesia. Our findings of a newly repurposed compound and a novel, genetically-encoded mechanism that each enhance Kcc2 gene expression enable us to re-normalize disrupted inhibitory neurotransmission through genetic re-programming.","Action Potentials;Adult;Analgesia;Analgesics;Animals;Behavior;Benzazepines;Bone Cancer;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Catenins;Cells;Cells, Cultured;Central Nervous System;Chlorides;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Drug Repositioning;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta;Growth;Humans;Indoles;Injuries;Ions;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphorylation;Rats;Rodentia;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Symporters;Synaptic Transmission;Transcription Factors;Transients;Vertebrates;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",Bone Cancer;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Injuries;Neuralgia;Pain,Nat Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34713624,2021,"Long-term antagonism and allosteric regulation of mu opioid receptors by the novel ligand, methocinnamox.","Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States. The only treatment available currently is the competitive antagonist, naloxone (Narcan® ). Although naloxone is very effective and has saved many lives, as a competitive antagonist it has limitations. Due to the short half-life of naloxone, renarcotization can occur if the ingested opioid agonist remains in the body longer. Moreover, because antagonism by naloxone is surmountable, renarcotization can also occur in the presence of naloxone if a relatively larger dose of opioid agonist is taken. In such circumstances, a long-lasting, non-surmountable antagonist would offer an improvement in overdose treatment. Methocinnamox (MCAM) has been reported to have a long duration of antagonist action at mu opioid receptors in vivo. In HEK cells expressing the human mu opioid receptor, MCAM antagonism of mu agonist-inhibition of cAMP production was time-dependent, non-surmountable and non-reversible, consistent with (pseudo)-irreversible binding. In vivo, MCAM injected locally into the rat hindpaw antagonized mu agonist-mediated inhibition of thermal allodynia for up to 96 h. By contrast, antagonism by MCAM of delta or kappa agonists in HEK cells and in vivo was consistent with simple competitive antagonism. Surprisingly, MCAM also shifted the concentration-response curves of mu agonists in HEK cells in the absence of receptor reserve in a ligand-dependent manner. The shift in the [D-Ala2 ,N-MePhe4 ,Gly-ol5 ]-enkephalin (DAMGO) concentration-response curve by MCAM was insensitive to naloxone, suggesting that in addition to (pseudo)-irreversible orthosteric antagonism, MCAM acts allosterically to alter the affinity and/or intrinsic efficacy of mu agonists.","Adenosine Monophosphate;Allosteric Regulation;Animals;Cause of Death;Cells;Cinnamates;Cyclic AMP;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Enkephalins;HEK293 Cells;Half-Life;Humans;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Ligands;Male;Morphine Derivatives;Naloxone;Narcan;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Production;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Therapeutics;Time;Time Factors;United States","Death;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Opiate Overdose",Pharmacol Res Perspect,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34772897,2022,Automated detection of squint as a sensitive assay of sex-dependent calcitonin gene-related peptide and amylin-induced pain in mice.,"We developed an automated squint assay using both black C57BL/6J and white CD1 mice to measure the interpalpebral fissure area between the upper and lower eyelids as an objective quantification of pain. The automated software detected a squint response to the commonly used nociceptive stimulus formalin in C57BL/6J mice. After this validation, we used the automated assay to detect a dose-dependent squint response to a migraine trigger, the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide, including a response in female mice at a dose below detection by the manual grimace scale. Finally, we found that the calcitonin gene-related peptide amylin induced squinting behavior in female mice, but not males. These data demonstrate that an automated squint assay can be used as an objective, real-time, continuous-scale measure of pain that provides higher precision and real-time analysis compared with manual grimace assessments.","Animals;Behavior;Blacks;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Eyelids;Female;Formalin;Islet Amyloid Polypeptide;Male;Measures;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Migraine Disorders;Neuropeptides;Pain;Scales;Sex;Software;Strabismus;Time;Whites",Migraine Disorders;Pain;Strabismus,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34798130,2022,Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 agonist SEW2871 alters membrane properties of late-firing somatostatin expressing neurons in the central lateral amygdala.,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that mediates a wide spectrum of biological processes including apoptosis, immune response and inflammation. Here, we sought to understand how S1P signaling affects neuronal excitability in the central amygdala (CeA), which is a brain region associated with fear learning, aversive memory, and the affective dimension of pain. Because the G-protein coupled S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) has been shown to be the primary mediator of S1P signaling, we utilized S1PR1 agonist SEW2871 and S1PR1 antagonist NIBR to determine a potential role of S1PR1 in altering the cellular physiology of neurons in the lateral division of the CeA (CeL) that share the neuronal lineage marker somatostatin (Sst). CeL-Sst neurons play a critical role in expression of conditioned fear and pain modulation. Here we used transgenic breeding strategies to identify fluorescently labeled CeL-Sst neurons for electrophysiological recordings. Using principal component analysis, we identified two primary subtypes of Sst neurons within the CeL in both male and female mice. We denoted the two types regular-firing (type A) and late-firing (type B) CeL-Sst neurons. In response to SEW2871 application, Type A neurons exhibited increased input resistance, while type B neurons displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential and voltage threshold, increased current threshold, and decreased voltage height. NIBR application had no effect on CeL Sst neurons, indicating the absence of tonic S1P-induced S1PR1. Our findings reveal subtypes of Sst neurons within the CeL that are uniquely affected by S1PR1 activation, which may have implications for how S1P alters supraspinal circuits.","Action Potentials;Affect;Amygdala;Animals;Apoptosis;Biological Processes;Brain;Breeding;Central Amygdaloid Nucleus;Electrophysiology;Fear;Female;GTP-Binding Proteins;Gene Expression;Immunity;Inflammation;Learning;Male;Membrane Potentials;Membranes;Memory;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Neurons;Organ Culture Techniques;Oxadiazoles;Pain;Phosphates;Physiology;Play;Principal Component Analysis;Resting Potentials;Role;S1P1 Receptor;Somatostatin;Sphingolipids;Sphingosine;Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators;Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors;Thiophenes",Inflammation;Pain,Neuropharmacology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34844727,2022,Role of primary sensory neurone cannabinoid type-1 receptors in pain and the analgesic effects of the peripherally acting agonist CB-13 in mice.,"Cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed in primary sensory neurones, but their role in pain modulation remains unclear. We produced Pirt-CB1R conditional knockout (cKO) mice to delete CB1Rs in primary sensory neurones selectively, and used behavioural, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches to examine the influence of peripheral CB1R signalling on nociceptive and inflammatory pain. Conditional knockout of Pirt-CB1R did not alter mechanical or heat nociceptive thresholds, complete Freund adjuvant-induced inflammation, or heat hyperalgesia in vivo. The intrinsic membrane properties of small-diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones were also comparable between cKO and wild-type mice. Systemic administration of CB-13, a peripherally restricted CB1/CB2R dual agonist (5 mg kg-1), inhibited nociceptive pain and complete Freund adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain. These effects of CB-13 were diminished in Pirt-CB1R cKO mice. In small-diameter neurones from wild-type mice, CB-13 concentration-dependently inhibited high-voltage activated calcium current (HVA-ICa) and induced a rightward shift of the channel open probability curve. The effects of CB-13 were significantly attenuated by AM6545 (a CB1R antagonist) and Pirt-CB1R cKO. CB1R signalling in primary sensory neurones did not inhibit nociceptive or inflammatory pain, or the intrinsic excitability of nociceptive neurones. However, peripheral CB1Rs are important for the analgesic effects of systemically administered CB-13. In addition, HVA-ICa inhibition appears to be a key ionic mechanism for CB-13-induced pain inhibition. Thus, peripherally restricted CB1R agonists could have utility for pain treatment.","Administration;Analgesics;Animals;Calcium;Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists;Cannabinoids;Disease Models, Animal;Female;Freund's Adjuvant;Ganglia, Spinal;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Male;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Morpholines;Naphthalenes;Neurons;Nociceptive Pain;Pain;Probability;Pyrazoles;Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1;Receptors, Cannabinoid;Role;Therapeutics",Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Inflammation;Nociceptive Pain;Pain,Br J Anaesth,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34856203,2022,"The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone produces a female-predominant inhibition of hyperalgesia associated with surgical incision, peripheral nerve injury, and painful diabetic neuropathy.","Pioglitazone, an agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, is FDA-approved for the treatment of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Numerous studies in male rodents suggest that pioglitazone inhibits inflammatory and neuropathic pain, but few included female subjects. To address this gap, we compared the effects of pioglitazone in both sexes in the intraplantar methylglyoxal model (MG) model of chemical pain and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), the plantar incision model (PIM) of postoperative pain, the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of traumatic nerve injury, and the ZDF rat and db/db mouse models of PDN. We administered pioglitazone by one-time intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection or by adding it to chow for 6 weeks, followed by measurement of hypersensitivity to non-noxious mechanical, noxious mechanical, heat, and/or cold stimuli. In all mouse models, injection of pioglitazone decreased pain-like behaviors with greater potency and/or efficacy in females as compared to males: heat and mechanical hypersensitivity in the MG model (0.1-10 mg/kg); mechanical hypersensitivity in the PIM model (10 μg); mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in the SNI model (100 mg/kg); and heat hypersensitivity in the db/db model (100 mg/kg). Furthermore, co-administration of low doses of morphine (1 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) decreased SNI-induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in female but not male mice. In the ZDF rat, pioglitazone (100 mg/kg) decreased heat and mechanical hypersensitivity with no sex difference. In the db/db model, pioglitazone had no effect when given into chow for 6 weeks at 0.3, 3 or 30 mg/kg doses. We conclude that females exhibit greater anti-hyperalgesic responses to pioglitazone in mouse models of chemical-induced nociception, postsurgical pain, neuropathic pain, and PDN. These findings set the stage for clinical trials to determine whether pioglitazone has analgesic properties across a broad spectrum of chronic pain conditions, particularly in women.","Address;Administration;Analgesics;Animals;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Cold Temperature;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Disease Models, Animal;Exhibition;Female;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Injuries;Insulin Resistance;Male;Mice;Morphine;Neuralgia;Nociception;Nociceptive Pain;PPAR gamma;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Pioglitazone;Pyruvaldehyde;Rats;Rodentia;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Surgical Wound;Therapeutics;Time;Women","Chronic Pain;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Diabetic Neuralgia;Diabetic Neuropathies;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Insulin Resistance;Neuralgia;Nociceptive Pain;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Surgical Wound",Neuropharmacology,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
34917858,2021,Thermal hyperalgesia and dynamic weight bearing share similar recovery dynamics in a sciatic nerve entrapment injury model.,"Chronic constriction injuries (CCI) of the sciatic nerve are widely used nerve entrapment animal models of neuropathic pain. Two common pain behaviors observed following CCI are thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, measured by the Hargreaves and von Frey tests, respectively. While thermal hyperalgesia tends to recover by 30 days, mechanical allodynia can persist for many more months thereafter. Consequently, mechanical allodynia has been used extensively as a measure of 'chronic pain' focusing on the circuitry changes that occur within the spinal cord. Here, using the sciatic nerve cuff variant of CCI in mice, we propose that in contrast to these evoked measures of nociceptive hypersensitivity, dynamic weight bearing provides a more clinically relevant behavioral measure for ongoing pain during nerve injury. We found that the effect of sciatic nerve cuff on the ratio of weight bearing by the injured relative to uninjured hindlimbs more closely resembled that of thermal hyperalgesia, following a trend toward recovery by 30 days. We also found an increase in the percent of body weight bearing by the contralateral paw that is not seen in the previously tested behaviors. These results demonstrate that dynamic weight bearing is a reliable measure of non-evoked neuropathic pain and suggest that thermal hyperalgesia, rather than mechanical allodynia, provides a proxy measure for nerve entrapment-induced ongoing pain.","Behavior;Body Weight;Chronic Pain;Constriction;Hindlimb;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Measures;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Models, Animal;Nerve Entrapments;Neuralgia;Pain;Proxy;Relatives;Sciatic Nerve;Spinal Cord;Weight-Bearing","Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Nerve Entrapments;Neuralgia;Pain",Neurobiol Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35093182,2022,Targeting the A3 adenosine receptor to prevent and reverse chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicities in mice.,"Cisplatin is used to combat solid tumors. However, patients treated with cisplatin often develop cognitive impairments, sensorimotor deficits, and peripheral neuropathy. There is no FDA-approved treatment for these neurotoxicities. We investigated the capacity of a highly selective A3 adenosine receptor (AR) subtype (A3AR) agonist, MRS5980, to prevent and reverse cisplatin-induced neurotoxicities. MRS5980 prevented cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment (decreased executive function and impaired spatial and working memory), sensorimotor deficits, and neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain) in both sexes. At the structural level, MRS5980 prevented the cisplatin-induced reduction in markers of synaptic integrity. In-situ hybridization detected Adora3 mRNA in neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. RNAseq analysis identified 164 genes, including genes related to mitochondrial function, of which expression was changed by cisplatin and normalized by MRS5980. Consistently, MRS5980 prevented cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased signs of oxidative stress. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the A3AR agonist upregulates genes related to repair pathways including NOTCH1 signaling and chromatin modification in the cortex of cisplatin-treated mice. Importantly, A3AR agonist administration after completion of cisplatin treatment resolved cognitive impairment, neuropathy and sensorimotor deficits. Our results highlight the efficacy of a selective A3AR agonist to prevent and reverse cisplatin-induced neurotoxicities via preventing brain mitochondrial damage and activating repair pathways. An A3AR agonist is already in cancer, clinical trials and our results demonstrate management of neurotoxic side effects of chemotherapy as an additional therapeutic benefit.","Adenosine;Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists;Administration;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Astrocytes;Brain;Cancer;Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment;Chromatin;Cisplatin;Clinical Trial;Cognitive Dysfunction;Drug Therapy;Executive Function;Female;Genes;In Situ Hybridization;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Memory, Short-Term;Mice;Microglia;Motor Activity;Neoplasms;Neuralgia;Neurons;Oligodendroglia;Oxidative Stress;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;RNA, Messenger;Receptor, Adenosine A3;Receptors, Purinergic P1;Sex;Spatial Memory;Therapeutics",Cancer;Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment;Cognitive Dysfunction;Mechanical Allodynia;Neoplasms;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35166070,2022,Inhibition of Integrin αvβ6 Activation of TGF-β Attenuates Tendinopathy.,"Tendinopathy is a common tendon disorder that causes pain and impairs function. It is the most common reason for consultation with musculoskeletal specialists. The available therapies for tendinopathy are limited in number and efficacy and have unclear cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here it is shown that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) activated by integrin αvβ6 promotes tendinopathy in mice. Excessive active TGF-β is found during tendinopathy progression, which led to tenocytes' phenotype transition to chondrocytes. Transgenic expression of active TGF-β in tendons induced spontaneous tendinopathy, whereas systemic injection of a TGF-β neutralizing antibody attenuated tendinopathy. Inducible knockout of the TGF-β type 2 receptor gene (Tgfbr2) in tenocytes inhibited tendinopathy progression in mice. Moreover, it is found that integrin αvβ6 induces TGF-β activation in response to mechanical load in tendons. Conditional knockout of the integrin αv gene in tendons prevented tendinopathy in mice. The study suggests that integrin αvβ6 activation of TGF-β is the mechanism of tendinopathy, and that integrin αvβ6 may be a therapeutic target in tendinopathy.","Animals;Antibodies, Neutralizing;Antigens, Neoplasm;Chondrocytes;Consultation;Genes;Injections;Integrin alphaV;Integrins;Mice;Pain;Phenotype;Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II;Specialists;Tendinopathy;Tendons;Tenocytes;Therapeutics;Transforming Growth Factor beta",Neoplasms;Pain;Tendinopathy,Adv Sci (Weinh),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35304127,2022,TET1 overexpression attenuates paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain through rescuing K2p1.1 expression in primary sensory neurons of male rats.,"Paclitaxel-induced downregulation of two-pore domain K+ channel 1.1 (K2p1.1) caused by increasing DNA methylation within its gene promoter in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contributes to neuropathic pain. Given that ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) promotes DNA demethylation and gene transcription, the present study investigated whether DRG overexpression of TET1 produces an antinociceptive effect on the paclitaxel-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity. TET1 was overexpressed in the DRG through unilateral microinjection of the herpes simplex virus expressing full-length Tet1 mRNA into the fourth and fifth lumbar DRGs of male rats. Behavioral tests were carried out to examine the effect of this overexpression on the paclitaxel-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity. Western blot analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine detection assay were performed to assess the levels of TET1/K2p1.1, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, respectively. DRG overexpression of TET1 mitigated the paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia, heat hyperalgesia and cold hyperalgesia on the ipsilateral side during the development and maintenance periods. Locomotor function or basal (acute) responses to mechanical, heat or cold stimuli were not affected. Mechanistically, DRG overexpression of TET1 rescued the expression of K2p1.1 by blocking the paclitaxel-induced increase in the level of 5-methylcytosine and correspondingly reversing the paclitaxel-induced decreases in the amount of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine within the K2p1.1 promoter region in the microinjected DRGs of male rats. Our findings suggest that DRG overexpression of TET1 alleviated chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain likely through rescuing DRG K2p1.1 expression. Our findings may provide a potential avenue for the management of this disorder.","5-Methylcytosine;Animals;Behavior Test;Blot, Western;Chromatin Immunoprecipitation;Cold Temperature;DNA Demethylation;DNA Methylation;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Dioxygenases;Down-Regulation;Drug Therapy;Ganglia, Spinal;Genes;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Maintenance;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Microinjections;Neuralgia;Paclitaxel;Potassium Channels;Promoter Regions, Genetic;RNA, Messenger;Rats;Sensory Receptor Cells;Simplexvirus",Ganglion Cysts;Herpes Simplex;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia,Life Sci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment

By investigating a deep-water clade of fish-hunting cone snails, we show that predator-prey evolution has generated a diverse set of SS analogs, each optimized to elicit specific systemic physiological effects in prey. The increased metabolic stability, distinct SS receptor activation profiles, and chemical diversity of the venom analogs make them suitable leads for therapeutic application, including pain, cancer, and endocrine disorders.

35507368,2023,E74-like factor 1 contributes to nerve trauma-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity through transcriptionally activating matrix metalloprotein-9 in dorsal root ganglion neurons.,"Nerve trauma-induced alternations of gene expression in the neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) participate in nerve trauma-caused nociceptive hypersensitivity. Transcription factors regulate gene expression. Whether the transcription factor E74-like factor 1 (ELF1) in the DRG contributes to neuropathic pain is unknown. We report here that peripheral nerve trauma caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of unilateral sciatic nerve or unilateral fourth lumbar spinal nerve ligation led to the time-dependent increases in the levels of Elf1 mRNA and ELF1 protein in injured DRG, but not in the spinal cord. Preventing this increase through DRG microinjection of adeno-associated virus 5 expressing Elf1 shRNA attenuated the CCI-induced upregulation of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) in injured DRG and induction and maintenance of nociceptive hypersensitivities, without changing locomotor functions and basal responses to acute mechanical, heat, and cold stimuli. Mimicking this increase through DRG microinjection of AAV5 expressing full-length Elf1 upregulated DRG MMP9 and produced enhanced responses to mechanical, heat, and cold stimuli in naive mice. Mechanistically, more ELF1 directly bond to and activated Mmp9 promoter in injured DRG neurons after CCI. Our data indicate that ELF1 participates in nerve trauma-caused nociceptive hypersensitivity likely through upregulating MMP9 in injured DRG.

35557456,2022,Characterization of Buprenorphine Antagonism at Human Mu Opioid Receptors.,"In 2017 the US government declared a public health emergency to address the national opioid crisis. Despite this focused effort and increased awareness, opioid overdose deaths have since increased by over 50%. Individuals with opioid use disorder have increased risk of opioid related death, and medication assistance can facilitate recovery by reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal effects. One such medication is buprenorphine, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of opioid use disorder sold under the brand Suboxone®, Subutex®, and Zubsolv®. While buprenorphine is clinically described as a partial agonist of the mu opioid receptor (MOR), the literature demonstrates that its pharmacological characteristics are complex. In ongoing studies we are rigorously characterizing the pharmacological actions of buprenorphine at the human MOR. A genetically encoded biosensor was used to monitor cAMP levels in real time in HEK293 cells expressing a low density of the human MOR. In these cells, buprenorphine acted as an antagonist, shifting the concentration response curve of the MOR agonist, DAMGO, to the right (reduced potency) in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to the action of the MOR antagonist naloxone. Unlike the effect of naloxone, buprenorphine also decreased the maximal response of DAMGO, an effect that saturated with increasing concentrations of buprenorphine. Similar antagonism by buprenorphine was observed when fentanyl was used as the MOR agonist. The effect of buprenorphine to decrease the potency of DAMGO was reduced by washout of buprenorphine. In contrast, the reduction in the maximal response to DAMGO was resistant to washout of buprenorphine. Both effects of buprenorphine (on DAMGO potency and efficacy) were prevented by pre-treatment with naloxone, followed by rigorous washout. This suggested that buprenorphine's effects were mediated by a naloxone-sensitive binding site, presumably the orthosteric site. Given the slow rate of dissociation of buprenorphine binding to MOR in several published studies and the rapid time-course involved in the cAMP response, we considered the possibility that the observed effects of buprenorphine were due to hemi-equilibrium conditions. Computations conducted using hemi-equilibrium equations support the hypothesis that the antagonist effects of buprenorphine in this system are due to hemi-equilibrium. These kinetics were further supported in high-expressing hMOR CHO cells, as buprenorphine agonism was resistant to reversal by naloxone or washing. As a frontline treatment for opioid use disorder, an understanding of buprenorphine's pseudo-irreversible binding may elucidate buprenorphine's unique properties and facilitate future drug discovery.","Address;Adenosine Monophosphate;Awareness;Binding Sites;Biosensors;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;CHO Cells;Cells;Comprehension;Craving;Death;Dissociation;Drug Discovery;Emergencies;Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-;Fentanyl;Future;Government;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Kinetics;Literature;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Risk;Suboxone;Subutex;Therapeutics;Time",Death;Dissociation;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,FASEB J,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
35701159,2022,Postsurgical Latent Pain Sensitization Is Driven by Descending Serotonergic Facilitation and Masked by µ-Opioid Receptor Constitutive Activity in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla.,"Following tissue injury, latent sensitization (LS) of nociceptive signaling can persist indefinitely, kept in remission by compensatory µ-opioid receptor constitutive activity (MORCA) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To demonstrate LS, we conducted plantar incision in mice and then waited 3-4 weeks for hypersensitivity to resolve. At this time (remission), systemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist/inverse agonist naltrexone reinstated mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. We first tested the hypothesis that LS extends to serotonergic neurons in the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) that convey pronociceptive input to the spinal cord. We report that in male and female mice, hypersensitivity was accompanied by increased Fos expression in serotonergic neurons of the RVM, abolished on chemogenetic inhibition of RVM 5-HT neurons, and blocked by intrathecal injection of the 5-HT3R antagonist ondansetron; the 5-HT2AR antagonist MDL-11 939 had no effect. Second, to test for MORCA, we microinjected the MOR inverse agonist d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) and/or neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6β-naltrexol. Intra-RVM CTAP produced mechanical hypersensitivity at both hindpaws; 6β-naltrexol had no effect by itself, but blocked CTAP-induced hypersensitivity. This indicates that MORCA, rather than an opioid ligand-dependent mechanism, maintains LS in remission. We conclude that incision establishes LS in descending RVM 5-HT neurons that drives pronociceptive 5-HT3R signaling in the dorsal horn, and this LS is tonically opposed by MORCA in the RVM. The 5-HT3 receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Surgery leads to latent pain sensitization and a compensatory state of endogenous pain control that is maintained long after tissue healing. Here, we show that either chemogenetic inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity in the RVM or pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT3 receptor signaling at the spinal cord blocks behavioral signs of postsurgical latent sensitization. We conclude that MORCA in the RVM opposes descending serotonergic facilitation of LS and that the 5-HT3 receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Drive;Female;General Surgery;Heat;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections, Intrathecal;Injuries;Lead;Ligands;Male;Medulla Oblongata;Mice;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Neurons;Ondansetron;Opioids;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Postoperative Pain, Chronic;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3;Report;Serotonergic Neurons;Serotonin;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics;Time;Tissues","Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Pain;Pain, Postoperative;Postoperative Pain, Chronic",J Neurosci,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment
36545239,2022,Intrathecal administration of the fat-mass and obesity-associated protein inhibitor mitigates neuropathic pain in female rats.,"Several intracellular signals are involved in the sexual dimorphism of chronic pain. Our previous studies demonstrated that the fat-mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), a demethylase of RNA N6-methyladenosine, in the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contributed to the development and maintenance of nerve injury-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in male rats and male mice. However, whether these effects of DRG FTO are in a sex-dependent manner is still unknown. The present study sought to investigate the effect of intrathecal administration of a specific FTO inhibitor, meclofenamic acid (MA), on chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in female rats. Intrathecal injection of MA attenuated the CCI-induced mechanical allodynia, heat hyperalgesia, and cold hyperalgesia in both the induction and maintenance periods, without changing acute/basal pain and locomotor function, in female rats. Intrathecal MA also blocked the CCI-induced hyperactivations of neurons and astrocytes in the ipsilateral L4 and L5 dorsal horns of female rats. Mechanistically, intrathecal MA prevented the CCI-induced increase in the histone methyltransferase G9a expression and reversed the G9a-controlled downregulation of mu-opioid receptor and Kv1.2 proteins in the ipsilateral L4 and L5 DRGs of female rats. These findings indicate that the effects of the FTO inhibitor on nerve injury-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in female rats are similar to those in male rats reported previously. Our data also further confirm the role of DRG FTO in neuropathic pain and suggest potential clinical application of the FTO inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of this disorder in both men and women.","Administration;Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO;Astrocytes;Chronic Pain;Cold Temperature;Constriction;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Down-Regulation;Female;Ganglia, Spinal;Heat;Histone Methyltransferases;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injections, Intrathecal;Injuries;Maintenance;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Meclofenamic Acid;Men;Mice;Neuralgia;Neurons;Pain;Proteins;RNA;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Role;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics;Women",Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Hyperalgesia;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Obesity;Pain,Transl Perioper Pain Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment

36245395,2022,The natural product argentatin C attenuates postoperative pain via inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and T-type voltage-gated calcium channels.,"Postoperative pain occurs in as many as 70% of surgeries performed worldwide. Postoperative pain management still relies on opioids despite their negative consequences, resulting in a public health crisis. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative therapies to treat chronic pain. Natural products derived from medicinal plants are potential sources of novel biologically active compounds for development of safe analgesics. In this study, we screened a library of natural products to identify small molecules that target the activity of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels that have important roles in nociceptive sensory processing. Fractions derived from the Native American medicinal plant, Parthenium incanum, were assessed using depolarization-evoked calcium influx in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Further separation of these fractions yielded a cycloartane-type triterpene identified as argentatin C, which was additionally evaluated using whole-cell voltage and current-clamp electrophysiology, and behavioural analysis in a mouse model of postsurgical pain. Argentatin C blocked the activity of both voltage-gated sodium and low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium channels in calcium imaging assays. Docking analysis predicted that argentatin C may bind to NaV 1.7-1.9 and CaV 3.1-3.3 channels. Furthermore, argentatin C decreased Na+ and T-type Ca2+ currents as well as excitability in rat and macaque DRG neurons, and reversed mechanical allodynia in a mouse model of postsurgical pain. These results suggest that the dual effect of argentatin C on voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels supports its potential as a novel treatment for painful conditions.","Alternative Therapies;American Natives;Analgesics;Calcium;Calcium Channels;Cells;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Electrophysiology;Ganglia, Spinal;General Surgery;Libraries;Macaca;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Natural Products;Neuralgia;Neurons;Opioids;Pain, Postoperative;Perception;Plants, Medicinal;Public Health;Rats;Role;Separation;Sodium;Therapeutics;Triterpenes;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels","Chronic Pain;Ganglion Cysts;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain, Postoperative",Br J Pharmacol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Discover and Validate Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment;NIDA SBIR

35708651,2022,A Standardized Emergency Department Order Set Decreases Admission Rates and In-Patient Length of Stay for Adults Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.,"Pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) causes severe complications and frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED). Patients with SCD frequently report inadequate pain treatment in the ED, resulting in hospital admission. A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess a quality improvement project to standardize ED care for patients presenting with pain associated with SCD. A 3-year prospective quality improvement initiative was performed. Our multidisciplinary team of providers implemented an ED order set in 2019 to improve care and provide adequate analgesia management. Our primary outcome was the overall hospital admission rate for patients after the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included ED disposition, rate of return to the ED within 72 hours, ED pain scores at admission and discharge, ED treatment time, in-patient length of stay, non-opioid medication use, and opioid medication use. There was an overall 67% reduction in the hospital admission rate after implementation of the order set (P = 0.005) and a significant decrease in the percentage admission rate month over month (P = 0.047). Time to the first non-opioid analgesic decreased by 71 minutes (P &gt; 0.001), and there was no change in time to the first opioid medication. The rate of return to the ED within 72 hours remained unchanged (7.0% vs 7.1%) (P = 0.93), and the ED elopement rate remained unchanged (1.3% vs 1.85%) (P = 0.93). After the implementation, there were significant increases in the prescribing of orally administered acetaminophen (7%), celecoxib (1.2%), and tizanidine (12.5%) and intravenous ketamine (30.5%) and ketorolac (27%). ED pain scores at discharge were unchanged for both hospital-admitted (7.12 vs 7.08) (P = 0.93) and non-admitted (5.51 vs 6.11) (P = 0.27) patients. The resulting potential cost reduction was determined to be $193,440 during the 12-month observation period, with the mean cost per visit decreasing by $792. Use of a standardized and multimodal ED order set reduced hospital admission rates and the timeliness of analgesia without negatively impacting patients' pain.","Acetaminophen;Adult;Analgesia;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Celecoxib;Cost;Emergency Service, Hospital;Hospitals;Humans;Ketamine;Ketorolac;Length of Stay;Observation;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Overall;Pain;Patients;Prospective Studies;Quality Improvement;Report;Retrospective Studies;Therapeutics;Time","Anemia, Sickle Cell;Pain",Pain Med,Clinical Research in Pain Management;Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Early Phase Pain Intervention Clinical Network (EPPIC Net);HEAL Data Eco-systemIntegrative Management of chronic Pain and OUD for Whole Recovery (IMPOWR)
29413434,2018,The effect of N-acetylcysteine on alcohol use during a cannabis cessation trial.,"Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) do not always respond to currently available treatments, and evaluation of new candidate pharmacotherapies is indicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an over-the-counter supplement, has shown promise in treating a variety of substance use disorders, but little research has evaluated its merits as a treatment for AUD. This secondary analysis from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network examined the effects of NAC versus placebo on alcohol use among participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) enrolled in a 12-week, multi-site cannabis cessation trial. Participants (N = 302, ages 18-50) were randomized to double-blind NAC (1200 mg, twice daily) or placebo. Neither alcohol use nor desire for alcohol cessation were requirements for participation. Participants that returned for at least one treatment visit and had recorded alcohol use data (i.e., total drinks per week, drinking days per week, and binge drinking days per week) were included in the analysis (n = 277). Compared to the placebo group, participants in the NAC group had increased odds of between-visit alcohol abstinence [OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.06-1.78; p = 0.019], fewer drinks per week [RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.48-0.99; p = 0.045], and fewer drinking days per week [RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.51-0.92; p = 0.014].

29846265,2018,Development and evaluation of addiction treatment programs in Latin America.,"The aim of this article is to present a state-of-the-art review of the scientific studies that have evaluated healthcare systems, services and programs for addiction treatment in Latin America. As a secondary aim, this article presents a brief description and analysis of the addiction prevention and treatment resources and programs available in Latin America, based on information from the ATLAS on Substance Use (ATLAS-SU) project led by the WHO. Substance use disorders (SUDs) are among the main causes associated with global burden of disease. Around the world, many initiatives have been proposed to promote policies to reduce substance use and reduce the impact of SUD, including integrating treatments into healthcare systems, increasing access to treatment programs and impacting outcome measures. In Latin America, multiple efforts have been implemented to improve addiction services and programs, although little is known about the impact they have generated. International studies report the availability of strategies and public inicitatives on prevention and treatment of addiction in Latin America. These studies also report established networks of public and private services that include prevention and detoxification programs, outpatient and residential treatment, and also social reintegration initiatives. However, despite these advances, information on the evaluation of the progress, results and impact of these programs is limited.",Access to Therapy;Delivery of Health Care;Global Burden of Disease;Health Care Systems;Humans;Latin America;National Health Programs;Outcome Measures;Outpatients;Policy;Program;Report;Residential Treatment;Resources;State-of-the-Art Review;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics,Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Curr Opin Psychiatry,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
30028058,2018,Withdrawal severity and early response to treatment in the outpatient transition from opioid use to extended release naltrexone.,"Long acting naltrexone has improved the therapy of opioid use disorder (OUD), and safe and effective withdrawal management during naltrexone induction may help advance treatment. Despite the uncertain role of opioid withdrawal in predicting successful outcomes, early symptom control may favor detoxification completion. We explored withdrawal severity and early response to treatment, safety, and clinical measures in 35 adult patients with DSM-5 OUD during a 7-day office-based buprenorphine-naltrexone and ancillary medications transition to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Subjective and objective measures of withdrawal intensity improved consistently throughout treatment in the whole sample. Participants who went on to receive XR-NTX (n = 27, 77%) reported a greater attenuation of symptoms by treatment day 2 (r = .595, p = .001), and were less likely to be injection drug users (r = -.501, p = .004). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded in 20% of participants: the majority (n = 6, 85.7%) consisted of single episodes of increased withdrawal which were well controlled using ancillary medications. One serious AE was unrelated to treatment. Early opioid withdrawal changes may be a useful indicator of treatment response, helping adjust the transition protocol to the individual patients' need and gather valuable information for a better understanding of the relationship between initiating and remaining in treatment.

30508432,2019,"Trends in Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis and Heart Valve Surgery, 2007 to 2017: A Study of Statewide Discharge Data.","Drug use-associated infective endocarditis (DUA-IE) is increasing as a result of the opioid epidemic. Infective endocarditis may require valve surgery, but surgical treatment of DUA-IE has invoked controversy, and the extent of its use is unknown. To examine hospitalization trends for DUA-IE, the proportion of hospitalizations with surgery, patient characteristics, length of stay, and charges. 10-year analysis of a statewide hospital discharge database. North Carolina hospitals, 2007 to 2017. All patients aged 18 years or older hospitalized for IE. Annual trends in all IE admissions and in IE hospitalizations with valve surgery, stratified by patients' drug use status. Characteristics of DUA-IE surgical hospitalizations, including patient demographic characteristics, length of stay, disposition, and charges. Of 22 825 IE hospitalizations, 2602 (11%) were for DUA-IE. Valve surgery was performed in 1655 IE hospitalizations (7%), including 285 (17%) for DUA-IE. Annual DUA-IE hospitalizations increased from 0.92 to 10.95 and DUA-IE hospitalizations with surgery from 0.10 to 1.38 per 100 000 persons. In the final year, 42% of IE valve surgeries were performed in patients with DUA-IE. Compared with other surgical patients with IE, those with DUA-IE were younger (median age, 33 vs. 56 years), were more commonly female (47% vs. 33%) and white (89% vs. 63%), and were primarily insured by Medicaid (38%) or uninsured (35%). Hospital stays for DUA-IE were longer (median, 27 vs. 17 days), with higher median charges ($250 994 vs. $198 764). Charges for 282 DUA-IE hospitalizations exceeded $78 million. Reliance on administrative data and billing codes. DUA-IE hospitalizations and valve surgeries increased more than 12-fold, and nearly half of all IE valve surgeries were performed in patients with DUA-IE. The swell of patients with DUA-IE is reshaping the scope, type, and financing of health care resources needed to effectively treat IE.

30556733,2019,"Tobacco and cannabis co-use: Drug substitution, quit interest, and cessation preferences.","The co-use of tobacco and cannabis is a common practice worldwide and carries with it substantial public health burden. Few interventions exist that target both substances and little is known about quit interest, treatment preferences, and drug substitution during past cessation attempts, which is critical to guide the development of treatment strategies. The goal of this study was to provide descriptive information regarding quit interest, treatment preferences, and perceived drug substitution among adult (age 18 +) cannabis-tobacco co-users. Participants (N = 282) from two independent survey samples (recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk) from across the United States were combined. Among all participants, 57% were female, 79% were White, and average age was 33.31 (SD = 9.54) years old. Approximately 80% had tried to quit smoking cigarettes at least once, while 40% had tried to quit using cannabis at least once. Of those who tried to quit, 50% self-reported a perceived increase in their cannabis use during tobacco cessation and 62% self-reported a perceived increase in their tobacco use during cannabis cessation. Average quit interest (10-point scale) for cannabis was 2.39 (SD = 2.35) and for tobacco was 7.07 (SD = 2.90). Results of this study suggest that tobacco use should be addressed among cannabis-tobacco co-users, but interventions should consider lack of interest in cannabis cessation. Reduction-based strategies for cannabis use appear to be more acceptable to this nontreatment-seeking, co-using population. Drug substitution during quit attempts for one substance should be further explored as an important treatment consideration.

30727792,2019,Sex differences in the prevalence and correlates of emergency department utilization among adults with prescription opioid use disorder.,"The emergency department (ED) is well-suited as an opportunity to increase treatment access for prescription opioid use disorder (POUD). We examined sex differences in ED utilization among individuals with POUD to understand potential sex-specific treatment barriers and needs. Data from the 2005-2014 National Surveys on Drug use and Health were analyzed to examine the prevalence and correlates of past-year ED utilization among male and female adults aged 18 or older with POUD (n = 4412). Overall, 58.2% of adults with POUD reported past-year ED utilization. Adjusted logistic regression revealed that females (vs. males) with POUD were more likely to report past-year ED utilization. Among females with POUD, older age, lower income, obtaining opioids from a physician, major depressive episode, and greater POUD severity were associated with increased odds of ED utilization. Among males with POUD, public insurance and obtaining opioids from a physician were associated with ED utilization. A larger proportion of males with POUD reporting ED use had multiple substance use disorders than those with no ED use. Treatment history (lifetime or past-year) for alcohol, drugs, or opioid use was associated with increased odds of ED use among males and females with POUD. Conclusions/Importance: Males and females with POUD presenting to the ED may have distinct predisposing, enabling, and need-related correlates. Sex-specific screening and intervention strategies may be useful to maximize the utility of the ED to address POUD.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Alcohols;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Health;History;Humans;Income;Insurance;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Report;Risk Factors;Screening;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Subst Use Misuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD

This study evaluated whether SUD is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications in patients with co-occurring T2DM and hypertension. Analysis of a limited data set obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys, a platform integrating data from electronic health records. Matched controls were defined for each of five SUDs: tobacco use disorder (TUD), opioid use disorder (OUD), cocaine use disorder, cannabis use disorder (CUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers. All patients were seen in the MetroHealth System (Cleveland, OH, USA) and had diagnosis codes for T2DM and hypertension. SUD group participants had a diagnosis of abuse/dependence for the substance of interest. Controls for each SUD group had no diagnosis code related to the SUD of interest and were selected to match the SUD patients on demographics, residential zip code median income and body mass index. Total sample sizes for each SUD-control comparison ranged from 1160 for CUD to 22 128 for TUD. Outcome was diagnosis (yes/no) of four T2DM complications (cerebrovascular accident, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic renal disease, myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality. Logistic regressions revealed that SUD was significantly associated with greater risk of cerebrovascular accident [TUD odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, OUD-OR = 1.94, cocaine use disorder OR = 2.67], diabetic neuropathy [TUD-adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.47, cocaine use disorder-aOR = 1.35, AUD-aOR = 1.27], diabetic renal disease (TUD-aOR = 1.25, OUD-OR = 1.34), myocardial infarction (TUD-OR = 1.96, OUD-OR = 2.01, cocaine use disorder-OR = 2.68, CUD-OR = 2.48, AUD-OR = 1.42) and mortality (TUD-OR = 1.15, cocaine use disorder-OR = 1.61, CUD-OR = 1.49, AUD-OR = 1.35).

30901744,2019,Blunts versus joints: Cannabis use characteristics and consequences among treatment-seeking adults.,"Despite the high prevalence of blunt smoking among cannabis users, very few studies examine the clinical profile of blunt smokers relative to those using more common methods of cannabis use, such as joints. The current study uses baseline data from the ACCENT (Achieving Cannabis Cessation-Evaluating N-acetylcysteine Treatment) study, a multi-site randomized pharmacotherapy clinical trial within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, to predict the association between blunt and joint use frequency and cannabis use characteristics (e.g., grams of cannabis used) and consequences (e.g., withdrawal) among past-month cannabis users (N = 377) who were screened for study participation. After controlling for race, age, gender, other forms of cannabis use (including joint use) and nicotine dependence, multivariable linear regression models indicated that the number of days of blunt use in the past month was a significant predictor of the average amount of cannabis per using day (t = 3.04, p &lt;  .01), the estimated average cost of cannabis (t = 2.28, p &lt;  .05) and Cannabis Withdrawal Scale scores (t = 1.94, p &lt;  .05). Frequency of joint use did not significantly predict any of the cannabis use characteristics or consequences. Blunt smokers may present to treatment with greater amounts of cannabis smoked and more intense withdrawal symptoms, which may adversely impact their likelihood of successful abstinence. Cannabis-dependent blunt smokers may be more likely to benefit from treatment that targets physiological and mood-related withdrawal symptoms.","Accent;Acetylcysteine;Adolescent;Adult;Association;Cannabis;Cannabis Dependence;Clinical Trial;Cost;Drug Abuse;Drug Therapy;Female;Form;Gender;Humans;Joints;Linear Models;Linear Regression;Male;Marijuana Smoking;Methods;Middle Aged;Mood;Nicotine Dependence;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Prevalence;Racial Stocks;Relatives;Scales;Smokers;Smoking;Smoking, Blunts;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;Tobacco Use Disorder;Withdrawal Symptoms",Cannabis Dependence;Drug Abuse;Nicotine Dependence;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Tobacco Use Disorder;Withdrawal Symptoms,Drug Alcohol Depend,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD

31246072,2020,A systematic scoping review of research on Black participants in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network.,"Black individuals experience a disproportionate burden of substance-related disabilities and premature death relative to other racial/ethnic groups, highlighting the need for additional research. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), a research platform for multisite behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of substance use treatments in community settings with diversified patient populations, provides a wealth of research knowledge on substance use. Although CTN trials have enrolled over 5,000 Black individuals since its inception in 2000, there has been no synthesis of the findings, discussion of the implications, or suggestions for future research for Black individuals. Members of the Minority Interest Group of the CTN conducted a scoping review of published research on Black participants in CTN trials. Studies were included if the sample was more than 75% Black and/or specific findings pertaining to Black participants were reported. The review yielded 50 articles, with studies that mostly focused on baseline characteristics, followed by substance use treatment outcomes, HIV/risky sex behaviors, retention, comorbid conditions and measurement issues. This review highlighted the importance of several issues that are critical to understanding and treating substance misuse among Black people, such as the characteristics of Black people entering treatment, measurement equivalence, and engaging/retaining adolescents and young adults in treatment. There is still a continued need to identify the most effective treatments for Black individuals who use substances. The CTN offers several untapped opportunities to further advance research on Black individuals who use substances (e.g., secondary analyses of publicly available data).

This study used data from the public-use files of the 2015, 2016, and 2017 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, which captured substance use and mental health problems among noninstitutionalized individuals. Prevalence and specific types of prescription opioids and other substances used and misused in the past year were examined among adolescents. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine correlates (demographics, other substances used, past-year major depressive episode, school enrollment, two-parent household, number of lifetime medical conditions, and survey year) of POU, NMPOU, and POUD. Multiple substance use was common within the past year. The most frequently used prescription opioids were hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, and other opioids among adolescents. Cannabis use disorder and alcohol use disorder were comparatively prevalent among opioid misusers. Several correlates (demographics, other substances used, lifetime medical conditions, major depressive episode, and survey year) of POU, NMPOU, and POUD were found. In this national sample, multiple substance use was common among adolescents with past-year POU and NMPOU. Clinical screening for opioid use problems, assessment, and treatment expansion for POUD can focus on persons with substance use, mental health, and/or behavioral problems. Longitudinal studies are needed to better elucidate temporal associations between POU and NMPOU/POUD among adolescents, and more prevention and treatment research on rural residents and minority groups is needed.","Adolescent;Alcohol Use Disorder;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cannabis;Codeine;Demography;Depressive Disorder, Major;Health;Health Surveys;Households;Humans;Hydrocodone;Logistic Regression;Longitudinal Studies;Mental Health;Minority Groups;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Parents;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Problem Behavior;Research;School Enrollment;Screening;Substance Use;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States","Alcohol Use Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use",J Adolesc Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
32076361,2020,Perceptions and preferences for long-acting injectable and implantable medications in comparison to short-acting medications for opioid use disorders.,"Treatment for opioid use disorders has recently evolved to include long-acting injectable and implantable formulations of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Incorporating patient preferences into treatment for substance use disorders is associated with increased motivation and treatment satisfaction. This study sought to assess treatment preferences for long-acting injectable and implantable MOUD as compared to short-acting formulations among individuals with OUD. We conducted qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews with forty adults recruited from across the United States through Craigslist advertisements and flyers posted in treatment programs. Eligible participants scored a two or greater on the heroin or opioid pain reliever sections of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medications, and Other Substances (TAPS) Tool, indicative of a past-year OUD. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. Twenty-four participants (60%) currently or previously had been prescribed MOUD. Sixteen participants (40%) expressed general opposition to MOUD, citing concerns that MOUD is purely financial gain for pharmaceutical companies and/or a ""band aid"" solution replacing one drug with another, rather than a path to abstinence. Some participants expressed personal preference for long-acting injectable (n = 16/40: 40%) and implantable formulations (n = 12/40: 30%) over short-acting formulations. About half of the participants were not willing to use injectables (n = 19/40: 48%) or implantables (n = 22/40: 55%), preferring short-acting formulations. Mixed evaluations of long- and short-acting MOUD focused on considerations of medication-related beliefs (privacy, concern over an embedded foreign body), the medication-related burden (convenience, provision of structure and support, medication administration, potential side effects), and medication-taking practices (potential for non-prescribed use, control over dosage, and duration of treatment). Though many participants personally prefer short-acting to long-acting MOUD, some were open to including long-acting formulations in the range of options for those with OUD. Participants felt long-acting formulations may reduce medication-related burden and the risk of diversion. Conversely, participants expressed concern about invasive administration and loss of control over their treatment. Results suggest support for expanded access to a variety of formulations of MOUD. The use of shared decision making may also help patients select the formulation best aligned with their experiences, values, and treatment goals.","Administration;Adult;Advertisement;Alcohols;Beliefs;Buprenorphine;Decision Making, Shared;Duration of Therapy;Foreign Bodies;Goals;Heroin;Humans;Injectables;Interview;Interviews, Telephone;Methadone;Motivation;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patient Preference;Patients;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Privacy;Program;Risk;Satisfaction;Solutions;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Tobacco;United States",Foreign Bodies;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
32097755,2020,A vulnerability assessment for the HCV infections associated with injection drug use.,"After the 2014-2015 HIV outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a nationwide analysis to identify vulnerable counties to an outbreak of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and prevent such an outbreak in the future. We developed a jurisdiction-level vulnerability assessment for HCV infections associated with injection drug use (IDU) in Utah. We used three years of data (2015-2017) from 15 data sources to construct a regression model to identify significant indicators of IDU. A ZIP Code, county, or individual-level measure of IDU does not exist, therefore, CDC has suggested using HCV cases as a proxy for IDU. We used the Social Vulnerability Index to highlight vulnerable areas to HCV outbreaks and applied Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify hot spots of HCV infections (i.e. current/ongoing HCV transmissions). Rates of skin infection, buprenorphine prescription, administered naloxone, teen birth, and per capita income were associated with HCV infections. The opioid epidemic is dynamic and over time, it impacts different communities through its sequelae such as HCV outbreaks. We need to conduct this vulnerability assessment frequently, using updated data, to better target our resources. Moreover, we should consider evaluating whether the improvement of HCV screening has an impact on controlling HCV outbreaks. The analysis informs Utah's agencies and healthcare officials to target resources and interventions to prevent IDU-related HCV outbreaks. Our results inform policymakers at the national level on possible indicators of HCV outbreaks as well.","Adolescent;Adult;Buprenorphine;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Community;Data Sources;Disease Outbreaks;Female;Future;Geographic Information Systems;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;Health Care;Health Policy;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Humans;Income;Index;Indiana;Indicators;Infections;Injections;Male;Measures;Naloxone;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Parturition;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Proxy;Resources;Screening;Skin;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Teens;Time;United States;Utah;Young Adult","HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Prev Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
32352815,2020,"Hazardous drinking, alcohol use disorders, and need for treatment among Pacific Islander young adults.","Pacific Islander (PI) young adults are suspected to bear heavy risk for hazardous drinking, alcohol use disorders (AUD), and alcohol-related harms. Yet, PIs remain among the most understudied racial groups in the United States-creating a lack of empirical data documenting their alcohol use problems and treatment needs. The present study presents the first known data on PI young adults' hazardous drinking, possible AUDs, alcohol-related harms, and treatment needs. Survey data were collected from 156 community-dwelling PI young adults (40% women, age 18-30 years) in 2 large PI communities: Los Angeles County and Northwest Arkansas. We screened participants for alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use, hazardous drinking, possible AUD, alcohol-related harms, and past-year need for mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Logistic regressions examined whether experiencing possible AUD and alcohol-related harms were associated with past-year need for treatment. PI young adults reported 78% lifetime rate of alcohol use with 56% screening positive for hazardous drinking, 49% for any possible AUD, and 40% experiencing significant alcohol-related harm (e.g., health, finances). Yet, just 25% of participants reported past-year need for SUD treatment. Although having possible AUD was not associated with perceived SUD treatment need, experiencing any alcohol-related harm associated with 4.7-13.2 times greater adjusted odds for needing treatment. Therefore, despite having low self-perceived treatment need, PI young adults experience excessive burden of hazardous drinking and alcohol-related harms. Given the profound negative social and health effects of AUDs, culturally grounded interventions should be designed to reduce PI young adults' elevated rates of hazardous drinking and alcohol-related harms.

32359670,2020,Primary care experiences of veterans with opioid use disorder in the Veterans Health Administration.,"While patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) are thought to encounter poor primary care experiences, the perspectives of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), specifically, are unknown. This study compares the primary care experiences of patients with OUD, other SUDs and no SUD in the Veterans Health Administration. The sample included Veterans who responded to the national Patient-Centered Medical Home Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients, 2013-2015. Respondents included 3554 patients with OUD, 36,175 with other SUDs, and 756,386 with no SUD; 742 OUD-diagnosed patients received buprenorphine. Multivariable multinomial logistic regressions estimated differences in the probability of reporting positive and negative experiences (0-100 scale) for patients with OUD, compared to patients with other SUDs and no SUD, and for OUD-diagnosed patients treated versus not treated with buprenorphine. Of all domains, patients with OUD reported the least positive experiences with access (31%) and medication decision-making (35%), and the most negative experiences with self-management support (35%) and provider communication (23%). Compared to the other groups, patients diagnosed with OUD reported fewer positive and/or more negative experiences with access, communication, office staff, provider ratings, comprehensiveness, care coordination, and self-management support (adjusted risk differences[aRDs] range from |2.9| to |7.0|). Among OUD-diagnosed patients, buprenorphine was associated with more positive experiences with comprehensiveness (aRD = 8.3) and self-management support (aRD = 7.1), and less negative experiences with care coordination (aRD = -4.9) and medication shared decision-making (aRD = -5.4). In a national sample, patients diagnosed with OUD encounter less positive and more negative experiences than other primary care patients, including those with other SUDs.

32631183,2020,Nonconsensual Dose Reduction Mandates are Not Justified Clinically or Ethically: An Analysis.,"This manuscript describes the institutional and clinical considerations that apply to the question of whether to mandate opioid dose reduction in patients who have received opioids long-term. It describes how a calamitous rise in addiction and overdose involving opioids has both led to a clinical recalibration by healthcare providers, and to strong incentives favoring forcible opioid reduction by policy making agencies. Neither the 2016 Guideline issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor clinical evidence can justify or promote such policies as safe or effective.","Analgesics, Opioid;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Chronic Pain;Drug Tapering;Guideline;Health Personnel;Health Policy;Humans;Incentives;Mandatory Programs;Manuscript;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Policy;Policy Making;Quality of Health Care;United States",Chronic Pain;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Law Med Ethics,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
32800083,2020,Increased Morbidity and Mortality in Hypertensive Patients With Substance Use Disorders: Electronic Health Record Findings.,"Substance use disorder (SUD) management by medical providers may be important for patients with comorbid health conditions exacerbated by SUD. This study evaluated potential associations of SUD with morbidity and mortality in a large sample of hypertensive patients. Analysis of a limited data set was obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys, a platform integrating data from electronic health records. Matched controls were defined for each of five SUDs: tobacco use disorder (TUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), cocaine use disorder (COUD), opioid use disorder (OUD), and cannabis use disorder (CUD) using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers. All patients were from The MetroHealth System (Cleveland, OH) and had diagnosed hypertension. SUD group participants had diagnosed abuse/dependence for the substance of interest. Controls for each SUD group had no diagnosis code related to the substance of interest and were selected to match the SUD patients on several factors. Total sample sizes for each SUD-control comparison ranged from 3,176 (CUD) to 49,696 (TUD); proportions of female patients ranged from 31.7% (AUD) to 51.2% (TUD). Outcomes were diagnosis (yes/no) of the following: cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. Logistic regressions revealed that SUD was significantly associated with cerebrovascular accident (odds ratios [ORs]: TUD = 2.23; AUD = 1.68; COUD = 2.53; OUD = 1.87; CUD = 2.20), renal failure (ORs: TUD = 1.46; COUD = 2.09; OUD = 1.77), myocardial infarction (ORs: TUD = 2.96; AUD = 1.92; COUD = 3.00), and mortality (ORs: TUD = 1.34; AUD = 1.60; COUD = 1.83; OUD = 1.35; CUD = 1.39). Among patients with hypertension, those with SUDs appear to have significantly greater risk for morbidity and mortality, suggesting the importance of managing SUD in hypertensive patients.",Adult;Aged;Alcohol Use Disorder;Association;Cannabis;Cocaine;Dataset;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Humans;Hypertension;Kidney Failure;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Middle Aged;Morbidity;Mortality;Myocardial Infarction;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Patients;Propensity Score;Risk;Sample Size;Stroke;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Tobacco Use Disorder,Alcohol Use Disorder;Hypertension;Kidney Failure;Myocardial Infarction;Opioid Use Disorder;Stroke;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Tobacco Use Disorder,J Stud Alcohol Drugs,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33074851,2021,The Influence of an Opioid Use Disorder on Initiating Physical Therapy for Low Back Pain: A Retrospective Cohort.,"Low back pain (LBP) is common among patients with an opioid use disorder (OUD). The extent to which patients with an OUD initiate physical therapy for LBP is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the association between a history of an OUD and initiation of physical therapy for LBP within 60 days of a primary care provider (PCP) visit for this condition. Claims from a single state-wide all payer claims database from June 30, 2013 and August 31, 2015 were used to establish a retrospective cohort of patients who consulted a PCP for a new episode of LBP. The outcome measure was patients who had at least 1 physical therapy claim within 60-days after the PCP visit. After propensity score matching on covariates, logistic regression was used to compare the outcome of patients with a history of an OUD to patients without an OUD. Propensity score matching resulted in 1360 matched pairs of participants. The mean age was 47.2 years (15.9) and 55.9% were female. Compared to patients without an OUD, patients with an OUD were less likely to initiate physical therapy for LBP (adjusted odds ratio  = 0.65, 95% confidence intervals:0.49-0.85). After a visit to a PCP for a new episode of care for LBP, patients with a history of an OUD are less likely to initiate physical therapy.",Association;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Database;Episode of Care;Female;History;Humans;Logistic Regression;Low Back Pain;Middle Aged;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Outcome Measures;Patients;Physical Therapy;Physical Therapy Modalities;Primary Health Care;Propensity Score;Retrospective Studies,Low Back Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33097315,2021,Commentary on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid use disorder treatment among Indigenous communities in the United States and Canada.,"This commentary focuses on how some Indigenous communities in the United States (U.S.) and Canada are addressing the opioid epidemic within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of the co-authors as researchers, clinicians, and pharmacists working within or among Indigenous communities in three eastern Canadian provinces and two western U.S. states. The pandemic has likely exacerbated opioid use problems among Indigenous communities, especially for individuals with acute distress or comorbid mental illness, or who are in need of withdrawal management or residential services. In response to the pandemic, we discuss first how greater prescription flexibility has facilitated and even increased access to medications for opioid use disorder. Second, we describe how Indigenous-serving clinics have expanded telemedicine services, albeit not without some challenges. Third, we note challenges with restricted participation in traditional Indigenous healing practices that can be helpful for addiction recovery. Fourth, we mention providers' worries about the pandemic's impact on their patients' mental health and safety. We argue that certain treatment transformations may be helpful even after the pandemic is over, through enhancing access to community-grounded treatment, decreasing stigma, and promoting patient self-efficacy.","Access To Medicines;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Canada;Comment;Community;Humans;Indigenous Peoples;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Patients;Pharmacists;Pliability;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Research Personnel;Safety;Self Efficacy;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;United States",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33145681,2020,A Research Agenda for Advancing Strategies to Improve Opioid Safety: Findings from a VHA State of the Art Conference.,"US military Veterans have been disproportionately impacted by the US opioid overdose crisis. In the fall of 2019, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) convened a state-of-the-art (SOTA) conference to develop research priorities for advancing the science and clinical practice of opioid safety, including both use of opioid analgesics and managing opioid use disorder. We present the methods and consensus recommendations from the SOTA. A core group of researchers and VA clinical stakeholders defined three areas of focus for the SOTA: managing opioid use disorder, long-term opioid therapy for pain including consideration for opioid tapering, and treatment of co-occurring pain and substance use disorders. The SOTA participants divided into three workgroups and identified key questions and seminal studies related to those three areas of focus. The strongest recommendations included testing implementation strategies in the VHA for expanding access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder, testing collaborative tapering programs for patients prescribed long-term opioids, and larger trials of behavioral and exercise/movement interventions for pain among patients with substance use disorders.","Access To Medicines;Accidental Falls;Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Art;Conferences;Consensus;Drug Overdose;Exercise;Humans;Methods;Military Personnel;Movement;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Program;Research;Research Personnel;Research Priorities;Safety;Science;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Veterans Health",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33386733,2021,Brief intervention medication therapy management: Establishment of an opioid misuse intervention model delivered in a community pharmacy.,"Medication expertise and close patient contact position community pharmacists to make significant contributions to combatting the opioid epidemic. This position facilitated the development and initial implementation of the Brief Intervention Medication Therapy Management (BIMTM) model to detect and address patient opioid misuse. BIMTM is an intervention consisting of 9 sessions. One medication management session is delivered by a pharmacist in a community pharmacy setting, and the remaining sessions are delivered telephonically by a patient navigator to follow up with goals established with the pharmacist and address concomitant health concerns that increase risk for misuse. We employed the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to summarize and present key findings from 4 distinct studies. CFIR domains addressed were (1) intervention characteristics, (2) outer setting, (3) inner setting, (4) process, and (5) characteristics of individuals. The study results show sequential development of evidence for BIMTM. A multistate cross-sectional pharmacist survey (n = 739) demonstrated limited pharmacist training and/or resources to address misuse, suggesting the need for external intervention development. Our multistakeholder intervention planning project showed limitations of current evidence-based models of care and of intervention implementation, which resulted in construction of the BIMTM. A multisite cross-sectional screening survey of patients (n = 333) established an electronic misuse screening protocol within 4 community pharmacies and identified opioid misuse in 15% of screened patients; among those patients, 98% had concomitant health conditions that contribute to the risk of opioid misuse. Presentation of study results to pharmacy leaders produced commitment for intervention implementation and a partnership to develop a grant proposal supporting this action. Our small-scale randomized trial evinced success in recruitment and retention and BIMTM patient benefit. The small-scale randomized trial likewise showed high levels of satisfaction with BIMTM. The establishment of BIMTM supports community pharmacist identification and intervention with patients engaged in misuse. Continued use of this research-based strategy may further empower pharmacists to address the opioid epidemic.",Address;Brief Interventions;Community Pharmacies;Community Pharmacists;Community Pharmacy Services;Crisis Intervention;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronics;Goals;Grants;Health;Humans;Medication Therapy Management;Needs;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Navigators;Patients;Pharmacists;Pharmacy;Prescription Drug Misuse;Research;Resources;Risk;Satisfaction;Scales;Screening;Surveys,Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,Am J Health Syst Pharm,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33933923,2021,Implementation of a New Hampshire community-initiated response to the opioid crisis: A mixed-methods process evaluation of Safe Station.,"New Hampshire (NH) ranked first for fentanyl- and all opioid-related overdose deaths per capita from 2014 to 2016 and third in 2017 with no rate reduction from the previous year relative to all other states in the US. In response to the opioid crisis in NH, Manchester Fire Department (MFD), the state's largest city fire department, launched the Safe Station program in 2016 in partnership with other community organizations. This community-based response to the crisis-described as a connection to recovery-focuses on reducing barriers to accessing resources for people with substance use and related problems. The study aim is to characterize the multi-organizational partnerships and workflow of the Safe Station model and identify key components that are engaging, effective, replicable, and sustainable. A mixed-methods design included: semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with 110 stakeholders from six groups of community partners (Safe Station clients, MFD staff and leadership, and local emergency department, ambulance, and treatment partner staff); implementation and sustainability surveys (completed by MFD stakeholders); and ethnographic observations conducted at MFD. Qualitative data were content analyzed and coded using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Survey subscales were scored and evaluated to corroborate the qualitative findings. Community partners identified key program characteristics including firefighter compassion, low-threshold access, and immediacy of service linkage. Implementation and sustainability survey data corroborate the qualitative interview and observation data in these areas. All participants agreed that community partnerships are key to the program's success. There were mixed evaluations of the quality of communication among the organizations. Safe Station is a novel response to the opioid crisis in New Hampshire that offers immediate, non-judgmental access to services for persons with opioid use disorders requiring community-wide engagement and communication. Data convergence provides guidance to the sustainability and replicability of the program.","Ambulances;Cities;Clients;Communication;Community;Compassion;Death;Emergency Service, Hospital;Fentanyl;Firefighters;Fires;Humans;Interview;Leadership;Methods;New Hampshire;Observation;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Persons;Program;Relatives;Research;Resources;Substance Use;Surveys;Therapeutics;Workflow",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34283690,2022,Physical therapists' attitudes are associated with their confidence in and the frequency with which they engage in prescription opioid medication misuse management practices with their patients. A cross-sectional study.,"Background: In the US, prescription opioid medication misuse (POMM) necessitates engagement of physical therapists (PTs). We (1) evaluated the attitudes of (PT) related to their management of patients with POMM and (2) examined the association between these attitudes and PTs confidence in POMM-related management abilities and the frequency with which they engaged in POMM-related management practices. Methods: We conducted a national survey of PTs that included a modified Drug and Drug Problems Perception Questionnaire (DDPPQ). Confidence in POMM-related abilities and the frequency of engaging in POMM-related management practices were measured. Logistic regression evaluated the association between the DDPPQ subscales (role adequacy, role legitimacy, role self-esteem, role support, job satisfaction) and confidence and frequency outcomes. Results: The analysis included 402 respondents. Role adequacy and legitimacy subscales were associated with confidence and frequency outcomes (p&lt;.05), indicating that more favorable role adequacy and legitimacy attitudes are associated with greater odds of having more confidence in POMM-related management abilities and of engaging in more frequent POMM-related management practices. Conclusions: PTs with a greater sense of preparedness to engage in POMM-related management were more likely to report greater confidence in POMM-related management abilities and engage in POMM-related management practices with greater frequency.","Ability;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Attitude;Cross-Sectional Studies;Humans;Job Satisfaction;Legitimacy;Logistic Regression;Methods;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Therapists;Physical Therapy;Practice Management;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescriptions;Questionnaires;Rehabilitation;Report;Respondents;Role;Self Esteem;Surveys",Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34524070,2021,Physical therapists should play a greater role in managing patients with opioid use and opioid misuse.,"The U.S. opioid crisis necessitates that health care providers of all types work collaboratively to manage patients taking prescription opioid medications and manage those who may be misusing prescription opioids. Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common diagnoses associated with an opioid prescription. Physical therapists commonly manage patients with musculoskeletal conditions and chronic pain. Some patients who attend physical therapy for pain management take prescription opioid medications for pain and some of these patients may be misusing prescription opioids. Physical therapists who manage patients with musculoskeletal conditions are well-positioned to help address the opioid crisis. Historically, physical therapists have not been adequately engaged in efforts to manage persons with co-occurring musculoskeletal pain and opioid misuse or OUD. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) has emphasized physical therapy over the use of prescription opioids for the management of painful conditions. The APTA, however, does not highlight the important role that physical therapists could play in monitoring opioid use among patients receiving treatment for pain, nor the role that physical therapists should play in screening for opioid misuse. Such screening could facilitate referral of patients suspected misuse to an appropriate provider for formal assessment and treatment. This commentary presents simulated musculoskeletal patient presentations depicting 2 common opioid use states; chronic opioid use and opioid misuse. The cases highlight and interactions that physical therapists could have with these patients and actions that the physical therapist could take when working inter-disciplinarily. Recommendations are provided that aim to increase physical therapists' knowledge and skills related to managing patients taking prescription opioid medications for pain.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Chronic Pain;Comment;Diagnosis;Health Personnel;Humans;Knowledge;Musculoskeletal Pain;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Persons;Physical Therapists;Physical Therapy;Play;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Referral;Role;Screening;Therapeutics;Work",Chronic Pain;Musculoskeletal Pain;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34702088,2021,The estimand framework and its application in substance use disorder clinical trials: a case study.,"Relapse rates among individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) remain high and new treatment approaches are needed, which require evaluation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Measurement and interpretation challenges for SUD RCT data are often ignored or presented only in statistical analysis plans. Since different analytic approaches may result in different estimates and thus interpretations of the treatment effect, it is important to present this clearly throughout the trial. Inconsistencies between study analyses and objectives present further challenges for interpretation and cross-study comparisons. The recent International Council for Harmonization (ICH) addendum provides standardized language and a common framework for aligning trial objectives, design, conduct, and analysis. The framework focuses on estimands, which describe the treatment effect and link the trial objective with the scientific question and the analytic approach. The use of estimands offers SUD researchers and clinicians the opportunity to explicitly address events that affect measurement and interpretation at the outset of the trial. Furthermore, the use of standard terminology can lead to clearer interpretations of SUD trials and the treatments evaluated in SUD trials. Resources for understanding and applying estimands are needed to optimize the use of this new, helpful framework. This Perspective provides this resource for SUD researchers. Specifically, it highlights the relevance of estimands for SUD trials. Furthermore, it demonstrates how estimands can be used to develop clinically relevant analyses to address challenges in SUD trials. It also shows how a standardized framework can be employed to improve the interpretation and presentation of SUD study findings.","Address;Affect;Case Study;Clinical Trial;Comprehension;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Humans;Language;Lead;News;Randomized Controlled Trial;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Relapse;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Terminology;Therapeutics",Relapse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34798887,2021,Implementation and first-year operating costs of an academic medical center-based syringe services program.,"Syringe services programs (SSPs) remain highly effective, cost-saving interventions for the prevention of blood-borne infections among people who inject drugs. However, there have been restrictions regarding financial resources allocated to these programs, particularly in the US South. This study aimed to provide cost data regarding the implementation and first-year operations of an academic-based SSP utilizing fixed and mobile strategies, including the integration of onsite wound care. We conducted a micro-costing study that retrospectively collected detailed resource utilization and unit cost data for both the fixed and mobile SSP strategies, including onsite wound care, from both healthcare and societal perspectives. A three-step approach was used to identify, measure, and value intervention costs, and cost components were categorized into implementation, variable program, and time-dependent costs. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of SSP operational changes (i.e., needs-based distribution and opt-out HIV/HCV testing) on the cost-per-participant. Cost data we presented as overall cost and cost-per-participant adjusted to 2017 US dollars. A total of 452 and 129 participants enrolled in fixed and mobile SSP services, respectively. The total cost associated with implementation and first year operations for the fixed site was $407,217.22 or $729.72 per participant and $311,625.52 or $2415.70 per participant for the mobile unit. The largest cost component for both modalities was time-dependent costs (personnel and overhead), while intervention materials (syringes, injection equipment, naloxone) were less than 15% of the total program cost. Implementation and operation of new SSP models continue to be low cost compared to treatment for the multitude of harms PWID face without access to evidence-based prevention. Future cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses integrating a comprehensive SSP model within an academic institution, including onsite wound care and other medical services, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of this model, and state-level policy action must be taken to lift the prohibition of state and local funds for the implementation, sustainability, and maintenance of these programs in Florida.","Academic Medical Centers;Blood-Borne Infections;Comprehension;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost Savings;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Equipment;Face;Florida;Funds;Future;HIV;HIV Infections;Health Care;Humans;Injections;Maintenance;Measures;Naloxone;Needle-Exchange Programs;Needs;News;Occupational Groups;Overall;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Program;Resources;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Syringes;Therapeutics;Time;Wounds","Blood-Borne Infections;HIV Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Wounds",Harm Reduct J,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
34802777,2022,"Validation of the tobacco, alcohol, prescription medication, and other substance use (TAPS) tool with the WHO alcohol, smoking, and substance Involvement screening test (ASSIST).","Community pharmacies are emerging as a valuable setting to identify patients with substance use. Few tools have been specially validated to screen patients in these settings, particularly among those prescribed opioid medications. The goal of this study was to validate the performance of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) tool in community pharmacy settings compared to a reference-standard substance use assessment. Participants were recruited while receiving opioid medications (not solely buprenorphine) from 19 pharmacies from a large national chain in Ohio and Indiana. Adults who were not involved in the criminal justice system or receiving cancer treatment were invited to participate in a one-time, cross-sectional, self-administered, health survey which included the TAPS tool. Substance use risks calculated from the TAPS tool were compared with the reference standard, World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) using confusion matrices. We calculated Areas Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics Curves (ROC) to evaluate the TAPS tool's validity. The TAPS tool showed fair or better discrimination between moderate-risk use and high-risk use for tobacco, alcohol, and prescription opioids (AUCs: 0.75-0.97 and fair or better discrimination between low-risk and moderate-risk use in five of eight subscales, including tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, and heroin (AUCs: 0.70-0.92).

35120065,2022,Association Between Benzodiazepine and Opioid Prescription and Mortality Among Patients in a Large Healthcare System.,"Coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines (BDZ) is associated with adverse outcomes, including greater healthcare utilization and overdose risk. This study aims to examine opioid and BDZ coprescription, dosing, and mortality among patients with and without opioid use disorder (OUD) in a large healthcare system. Using data from the California state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program during 2010 to 2014 linked with a large healthcare system electronic health record database and mortality records from the Centers for Disease Control National Death Index, this study examined 5202 patients (1978 with OUD, 3224 controls). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between most recent BDZ and opioid prescription, and their interaction with respect to mortality. About 10.5% of the sample died on or before December 31, 2014. About 17.7% were prescribed BDZ during the final month of observation. Individuals with OUD were prescribed higher average BDZ and opioid doses than those without OUD. After adjusting for covariates, increased prescribed doses of BDZ (odds ratio [OR]=1.34, 95%CI: 1.15-1.55 per 10 mg/d increment) and opioids (OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.02-1.05 per 10 mg/d increment) were positively associated with mortality. Non-OUD patients who received both BDZ and opioid prescriptions had a higher mortality than those who received only BDZ or opioids (The ratio of odds ratio (ROR) = 3.83, 95%CI: 1.78-8.21). Study findings highlight significant mortality associated with the coprescription of opioids and BDZ in a general healthcare setting. Further research is needed to elucidate factors associated with mortality among non-OUD patients who are co-prescribed opioids and BDZ.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Benzodiazepines;California;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Database;Death;Delivery of Health Care;Electronic Health Records;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Humans;Index;Logistic Regression;Mortality;Observation;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Records;Research;Respect;Risk",Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
35417791,2022,Pain Severity and Interference and Substance Use Among Community Pharmacy Patients Prescribed Opioids: A Secondary Analysis of the PHARMSCREEN Study.,"This secondary analysis examined relationships between pain severity and interference and substance use among patients filling opioid prescriptions in Indiana and Ohio community pharmacies (n = 1,461). We likewise sought to explore the moderating role of gender in pain-substance use relations. We used patient-reported data from a cross-sectional health survey linked with controlled substance dispensing data from statewide prescription drug monitoring programs. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between pain severity and interference and various indices of risky prescription opioid use and non-opioid substance use. Exploratory analyses examined whether gender moderated associations. Increased pain severity was associated with increased odds of moderate- to high-risk opioid use (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.16-1.31) and opioid-benzodiazepine co-use (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03-1.40). Increased pain interference was associated with greater odds of receiving opioids from multiple pharmacies or providers (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01-1.31). Increased pain severity and interference were associated with higher odds of any tobacco use (severity: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.21; interference: OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12) and weekly to daily sedative use (severity: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25; interference: OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.22). Increased pain severity was associated with decreased odds of any alcohol use (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). Gender was a significant effect modifier in associations between pain and alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use. The study was registered in the database of clinicaltrials.gov (register number NCT03936985). Perspective: This study suggests that pain severity and interference are associated with increased use of non-medical prescription opioids, sedatives, and tobacco and decreased use of alcohol, in ways that are different between women and men. Findings may guide the development of gender-sensitive evidence-based strategies to ameliorate or prevent substance misuse among patients living with pain.","Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Benzodiazepine;Cannabis;Community Pharmacies;Controlled Substances;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Female;Gender;Health Surveys;Humans;Indiana;Logistic Regression;Male;Men;Ohio;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Measurement;Patients;Pharmacy;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Registers;Risk;Role;Sedatives;Substance Use;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Women",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use,J Pain,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
35573377,2022,The Feasibility and Utility of Harnessing Digital Health to Understand Clinical Trajectories in Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder: D-TECT Study Design and Methodological Considerations.,"Across the U.S., the prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) and the rates of opioid overdoses have risen precipitously in recent years. Several effective medications for OUD (MOUD) exist and have been shown to be life-saving. A large volume of research has identified a confluence of factors that predict attrition and continued substance use during substance use disorder treatment. However, much of this literature has examined a small set of potential moderators or mediators of outcomes in MOUD treatment and may lead to over-simplified accounts of treatment non-adherence. Digital health methodologies offer great promise for capturing intensive, longitudinal ecologically-valid data from individuals in MOUD treatment to extend our understanding of factors that impact treatment engagement and outcomes. This paper describes the protocol (including the study design and methodological considerations) from a novel study supported by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This study (D-TECT) primarily seeks to evaluate the feasibility of collecting ecological momentary assessment (EMA), smartphone and smartwatch sensor data, and social media data among patients in outpatient MOUD treatment. It secondarily seeks to examine the utility of EMA, digital sensing, and social media data (separately and compared to one another) in predicting MOUD treatment retention, opioid use events, and medication adherence [as captured in electronic health records (EHR) and EMA data]. To our knowledge, this is the first project to include all three sources of digitally derived data (EMA, digital sensing, and social media) in understanding the clinical trajectories of patients in MOUD treatment. These multiple data streams will allow us to understand the relative and combined utility of collecting digital data from these diverse data sources. The inclusion of EHR data allows us to focus on the utility of digital health data in predicting objectively measured clinical outcomes. Results may be useful in elucidating novel relations between digital data sources and OUD treatment outcomes.

35710401,2022,Mining comorbidities of opioid use disorder from FDA adverse event reporting system and patient electronic health records.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) has become an urgent health problem. People with OUD often experience comorbid medical conditions. Systematical approaches to identifying co-occurring conditions of OUD can facilitate a deeper understanding of OUD mechanisms and drug discovery. This study presents an integrated approach combining data mining, network construction and ranking, and hypothesis-driven case-control studies using patient electronic health records (EHRs). First, we mined comorbidities from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) of 12 million unique case reports using frequent pattern-growth algorithm. The performance of OUD comorbidity mining was measured by precision and recall using manually curated known OUD comorbidities. We then constructed a disease comorbidity network using mined association rules and further prioritized OUD comorbidities. Last, novel OUD comorbidities were independently tested using EHRs of 75 million unique patients. The OUD comorbidities from association rules mining achieves a precision of 38.7% and a recall of 78.2 Based on the mined rules, the global DCN was constructed with 1916 nodes and 32,175 edges. The network-based OUD ranking result shows that 43 of 55 known OUD comorbidities were in the first decile with a precision of 78.2%. Hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes were two top-ranked novel OUD comorbidities identified by data mining and network ranking algorithms. Based on EHR-based case-control studies, we showed that patients with OUD had significantly increased risk for hyperthyroidism (AOR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.43-1.49, p value &lt; 0.001), hypothyroidism (AOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.42-1.48, p value &lt; 0.001), type 2-diabetes (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.26-1.29, p value &lt; 0.001), compared with individuals without OUD. Our study developed an integrated approach for identifying and validating novel OUD comorbidities from health records of 87 million unique patients (12 million for discovery and 75 million for validation), which can offer new opportunities for OUD mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and multi-component service delivery for co-occurring medical conditions among patients with OUD.","Algorithms;Association;Case Reports;Case-Control Studies;Comorbidity;Comprehension;Data Mining;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Disease;Drug Discovery;Electronic Health Records;Growth;Health;Humans;Hyperthyroidism;Hypothyroidism;Informatics;Mining;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Records;Risk;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Hyperthyroidism;Hypothyroidism;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
35838242,2022,"Design, Implementation, and Evolution of the Medicaid Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN).","In the US, Medicaid covers over 80 million Americans. Comparing access, quality, and costs across Medicaid programs can provide policymakers with much-needed information. As each Medicaid agency collects its member data, multiple barriers prevent sharing Medicaid data between states. To address this gap, the Medicaid Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN) developed a research network of states to conduct rapid multi-state analyses without sharing individual-level data across states. To describe goals, design, implementation, and evolution of MODRN to inform other research networks. MODRN implemented a distributed research network using a common data model, with each state analyzing its own data; developed standardized measure specifications and statistical software code to conduct analyses; and disseminated findings to state and federal Medicaid policymakers. Based on feedback on Medicaid agency priorities, MODRN first sought to inform Medicaid policy to improve opioid use disorder treatment, particularly medication treatment. Since its 2017 inception, MODRN created 21 opioid use disorder quality measures in 13 states. MODRN modified its common data model over time to include additional elements. Initial barriers included harmonizing utilization data from Medicaid billing codes across states and adapting statistical methods to combine state-level results. The network demonstrated its utility and addressed barriers to conducting multi-state analyses of Medicaid administrative data. MODRN created a new, scalable, successful model for conducting policy research while complying with federal and state regulations to protect beneficiary health information.

35849749,2022,Patient-centered quality measurement for opioid use disorder: Development of a taxonomy to address gaps in research and practice.,"Background: Evidence-based treatment is provided infrequently and inconsistently to patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Treatment guidelines call for high-quality, patient-centered care that meets individual preferences and needs, but it is unclear whether current quality measures address individualized aspects of care and whether measures of patient-centered OUD care are supported by evidence. Methods: We conducted an environmental scan of OUD care quality to (1) evaluate patient-centeredness in current OUD quality measures endorsed by national agencies and in national OUD treatment guidelines; and (2) review literature evidence for patient-centered care in OUD diagnosis and management, including gaps in current guidelines, performance data, and quality measures. We then synthesized these findings to develop a new quality measurement taxonomy that incorporates patient-centered aspects of care and identifies priority areas for future research and quality measure development. Results: Across 31 endorsed OUD quality measures, only two measures of patient experience incorporated patient preferences and needs, while national guidelines emphasized providing patient-centered care. Among 689 articles reviewed, evidence varied for practices of patient-centered care. Many practices were supported by guidelines and substantial evidence, while others lacked evidence despite guideline support. Our synthesis of findings resulted in EQuIITable Care, a taxonomy comprised of six classifications: (1) patient Experience and engagement, (2) Quality of life; (3) Identification of patient risks; (4) Interventions to mitigate patient risks; (5) Treatment; and (6) Care coordination and navigation. Conclusions: Current quality measurement for OUD lacks patient-centeredness. EQuIITable Care for OUD provides a roadmap to develop measures of patient-centered care for OUD.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Classification;Diagnosis;Future;Guideline;Humans;Life;Measures;Methods;Needs;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Preference;Patient-Centered Care;Patients;Quality of Health Care;Quality of Life;Research;Review Literature;Risk;Taxonomy;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
35900201,2022,"Application of machine learning algorithms for localized syringe services program policy implementation - Florida, 2017.","People who inject drugs (PWID) are at an amplified vulnerability for experiencing a multitude of harms related to their substance use, including viral (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C) and bacterial infections (e.g. endocarditis). Implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as syringe services programs (SSPs), remains imperative, particularly in locations at an increased risk of HIV outbreaks. This study aims to identify communities in Florida that are high-priority locations for SSP implementation by examining state-level data related to the substance use and overdose crises. State-level surveillance data were aggregated at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) (n = 983) for 2017. We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection as a proxy of injection drug use. Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) regression was used to develop a machine learning model to identify significant indicators of acute HCV infection and high-priority areas for SSP implementation due to their increased vulnerability to an HIV outbreak. The final model retained three variables of importance: (1) the number of drug-associated skin and soft tissue infection hospitalizations, (2) the number of chronic HCV infections in people aged 18-39, and 3) the number of drug-associated endocarditis hospitalizations. High-priority SSP implementation locations were identified in both urban and rural communities outside of current Ending the HIV Epidemic counties. SSPs are long researched, safe, and effective evidence-based programs that offer a variety of services that reduce disease transmission and assist with combating the overdose crisis. Opportunities to increase services in needed regions across the state now exist in Florida as supported by the expansion of the Infectious Disease Elimination Act of 2019. This study provides details where potential areas of concern may be and highlights regions where future evidence-based harm reduction programs, such as SSPs, would be useful to reduce opioid overdoses and disease transmission among PWID.Key messagesThe rate of acute HCV in Florida in 2017 was 1.9 per 100,000, nearly twice the national average.Serious injection related infections among PWID are significant indicators of acute HCV infection.High-priority SSP implementation locations in Florida were identified in both urban and rural communities, including those outside of current Ending the HIV Epidemic counties.","Aged;Algorithms;Bacterial Infections;Communicable Diseases;Community;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Endocarditis;Epidemics;Florida;Future;HIV;HIV Infections;Harm Reduction;Hepatitis C;Hospitalization;Humans;Indicators;Infections;Injections;Machine Learning;Needle-Exchange Programs;Opiate Overdose;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Program;Proxy;Risk;Rural Communities;Skin;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Syringes","Bacterial Infections;Communicable Diseases;Endocarditis;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Infections;Opiate Overdose;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use",Ann Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
36614917,2022,Differential Effects of Patient Navigation across Latent Profiles of Barriers to Care among People Living with HIV and Comorbid Conditions.,"Engaging people living with HIV who report substance use (PLWH-SU) in care is essential to HIV medical management and prevention of new HIV infections. Factors associated with poor engagement in HIV care include a combination of syndemic psychosocial factors, mental and physical comorbidities, and structural barriers to healthcare utilization. Patient navigation (PN) is designed to reduce barriers to care, but its effectiveness among PLWH-SU remains unclear. We analyzed data from NIDA Clinical Trials Network's CTN-0049, a three-arm randomized controlled trial testing the effect of a 6-month PN with and without contingency management (CM), on engagement in HIV care and viral suppression among PLWH-SU (n = 801). Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals' experiences to 23 barriers to care. The effects of PN on engagement in care and viral suppression were compared across latent profiles. Three latent profiles of barriers to care were identified. The results revealed that PN interventions are likely to be most effective for PLWH-SU with fewer, less severe healthcare barriers. Special attention should be given to individuals with a history of abuse, intimate partner violence, and discrimination, as they may be less likely to benefit from PN alone and require additional interventions.",Arm;Attention;Clinical Trial;Comorbidity;HIV;HIV Infections;Health Care;History;Intimate Partner Violence;News;Patient Navigation;Persons;Psychosocial Factors;Randomized Controlled Trial;Report;Social Determinants of Health;Substance Use;Syndemic;Violence,HIV Infections;Substance Use,J Clin Med,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD
33757707,2021,Using community engagement to implement evidence-based practices for opioid use disorder: A data-driven paradigm &amp; systems science approach.,"Community-driven responses are essential to ensure the adoption, reach and sustainability of evidence-based practices (EBPs) to prevent new cases of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reduce fatal and non-fatal overdoses. Most organizational approaches for selecting and implementing EBPs remain top-down and individually oriented without community engagement (CE). Moreover, few CE approaches have leveraged systems science to integrate community resources, values and priorities. This paper provides a novel CE paradigm that utilizes a data-driven and systems science approach; describes the composition, functions, and roles of researchers in CE; discusses unique ethical considerations that are particularly salient to CE research; and provides a description of how systems science and data-driven approaches to CE may be employed to select a range of EBPs that collectively address community needs. Finally, we conclude with scientific recommendations for the use of CE in research. Greater investment in CE research is needed to ensure contextual, equitable, and sustainable access to EBPs, such as medications for OUD (MOUD) in communities heavily impacted by the opioid epidemic. A data-driven approach to CE research guided by systems science has the potential to ensure adequate saturation and sustainability of EBPs that could significantly reduce opioid overdose and health inequities across the US.","Address;Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Community-Based Participatory Research;Drug Overdose;Evidence-Based Practice;Health;Humans;Investments;Needs;News;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Paper;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Science",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;HEALing CommunitiesManagement of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
34145186,2022,Harnessing the Power of Social Media to Understand the Impact of COVID-19 on People Who Use Drugs During Lockdown and Social Distancing.,"This paper uses a social media platform, Reddit, to identify real-time experiences of people who use drugs during the COVID-19 lock-down. Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related ""subreddits,"" communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users' posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time. The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809 posts/comments (3756 posts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256 posts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%). During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery. As the pandemic progresses, providers and policymakers should consider these experiences among people who use drugs during the early stage of the pandemic.","COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Collection;Comment;Communicable Disease Control;Community;Confusion;Dataset;Humans;Machine Learning;Methadone;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pandemics;Paper;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Distancing;Power, Psychological;SARS-CoV-2;Social Media;Suboxone;Time;Unsupervised Machine Learning",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Communicable Diseases;Confusion;Opioid Use Disorder,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;HEALing CommunitiesManagement of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
35783994,2022,What is the prevalence of and trend in opioid use disorder in the United States from 2010 to 2019? Using multiplier approaches to estimate prevalence for an unknown population size.,"Opioid-related overdose deaths have increased since 2010 in the U.S., but information on trends in opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence is limited due to unreliable data. Multiplier methods are a classical epidemiological technique to estimate prevalence when direct estimation is infeasible or unreliable. We used two different multiplier approaches to estimate OUD prevalence from 2010 to 2019. First, we estimated OUD in National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and based on existing capture-recapture studies, multiplied prevalence by 4.5x. Second, we estimated the probability of drug poisoning death among people with OUD (Meta-analysis indicates 0.52/100,000), and divided the number of drug poisoning deaths in the US by this probability. Estimates were weighted to account for increase in drug-related mortality in recent years due to fentanyl. Estimated OUD prevalence was lowest when estimated in NSDUH with no multiplier, and highest when estimated from vital statistics data without adjustment. Consistent findings emerged with two methods: NSDUH data with multiplier correction, and vital statistics data with multiplier and adjustment. From these two methods, OUD prevalence increased from 2010 to 2014; then stabilized and slightly declined annually (survey data with multiplier, highest prevalence of 4.0% in 2015; death data with a multiplier and correction, highest prevalence of 2.35% in 2016). The number of US adolescent and adult individuals with OUD in 2019 was estimated between 6.7-7.6 million. When multipliers and corrections are used, OUD may have stabilized or slightly declined after 2015. Nevertheless, it remains highly prevalent, affecting 6-7 million US adolescents and adults.",Adjustment;Adolescent;Adult;Death;Fentanyl;Health;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poisoning;Population Size;Prevalence;Probability;Surveys;United States;Vital Statistics,Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Poisoning,Drug Alcohol Depend Rep,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;HEALing CommunitiesManagement of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33251171,2020,"The Opioid/Overdose Crisis as a Dialectics of Pain, Despair, and One-Sided Struggle.","The opioid/overdose crisis in the United States and Canada has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and has become a major field for research and interventions. It has embroiled pharmaceutical companies in lawsuits and possible bankruptcy filings. Effective interventions and policies toward this and future drug-related outbreaks may be improved by understanding the sociostructural roots of this outbreak. Much of the literature on roots of the opioid/overdose outbreak focuses on (1) the actions of pharmaceutical companies in inappropriately promoting the use of prescription opioids; (2) ""deaths of despair"" based on the deindustrialization of much of rural and urban Canada and the United States, and on the related marginalization and demoralization of those facing lifetimes of joblessness or precarious employment in poorly paid, often dangerous work; and (3) increase in occupationally-induced pain and injuries in the population. All three of these roots of the crisis-pharmaceutical misconduct and unethical marketing practices, despair based on deindustrialization and increased occupational pain-can be traced back, in part, to what has been called the ""one-sided class war"" that became prominent in the 1970s, became institutionalized as neo-liberalism in and since the 1980s, and may now be beginning to be challenged. We describe this one-sided class war, and how processes it sparked enabled pharmaceutical corporations in their misconduct, nurtured individualistic ideologies that fed into despair and drug use, weakened institutions that created social support in communities, and reduced barriers against injuries and other occupational pain at workplaces by reducing unionization, weakening surviving unions, and weakening the enforcement of rules about workplace safety and health. We then briefly discuss the implications of this analysis for programs and policies to mitigate or reverse the opioid/overdose outbreak.","Analgesics, Opioid;Back;Bankruptcy;Canada;Community;Comprehension;Death;Demoralization;Disease Outbreaks;Filing;Future;Health;Humans;Injuries;Liberalism;Literature;Marketing;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Precarious Employment;Prescriptions;Program;Research;Safety;Social Support;United States;Wars;Work;Workplace",Death;Injuries;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Front Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary CarePrevention;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"

We conducted interviews and surveys with participants who inject drugs or misuse prescription opioids in 2 rural Oregon counties with high opioid overdose rates. Survey participants were identified through participant-driven sampling initiated in syringe service programs and field outreach (n = 144). Semi-structured interviews with participants were recruited from the same locations (n = 52). Of 144 surveys completed, 112 reported using opioids in the past 30 days; 96% of the 112 also report methamphetamine use. Among the 124 reporting injection drug use, 50% indicated they injected both methamphetamine and heroin in the past 30 days. Interview participants reported early exposure to methamphetamine and indicated that methamphetamine was more widely available, less expensive, and less stigmatized compared to heroin. Participants reported using methamphetamine to improve work-life functioning and because they enjoy the high produced from simultaneous use. Several participants reported a conscious effort to shift to methamphetamine from heroin as a harm reduction strategy.Some participants reported being involuntarily discharged from treatment for opioid use disorder due to methamphetamine use. Several participants perceived methamphetamine as conveying overdose prevention or reversal benefits, while fentanyl contamination in methamphetamine was reported or suspected. As rural communities respond to evolving drug supply and demand, there is increasing need for public health efforts to address the emerging issue of concurrent methamphetamine and opioid use.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Drug Overdose;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Heroin;Humans;Injections;Interview;Life;Methamphetamine;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Oregon;Perception;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Program;Public Health;Report;Rural Communities;Rural Population;Supplies;Surveys;Syringes;Therapeutics;Work",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Prescription Opioid Misuse,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

33962813,2022,Incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation impede use of medication for opioid use disorder and HIV care engagement in Vietnam.,"Non-prescribed opioid use is illegal in Vietnam. People who are apprehended for use of non-prescribed opioids may be arrested and incarcerated or sent to compulsory rehabilitation centers. For those on medication to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD), incarceration in either setting may disrupt treatment. This study estimates the effects of incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation on MOUD and HIV treatment outcomes in Vietnam. Data are from a clinical trial testing the effects of MOUD on HIV viral suppression in six Vietnamese HIV clinics. Participants were assessed quarterly for 12 months. We assessed the associations between incarceration or compulsory rehabilitation during months 0-9 and study outcomes of receipt of MOUD, HIV clinic engagement, and antiretroviral therapy prescription during months 9-12, among those who were released by month 9 of the study, using logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial models. At nine months, 25 of 258 participants (9.7%) were incarcerated or sent to compulsory rehabilitation at least once and completed the month 9 assessment. Of those, 19 (76.0%) did not receive MOUD in months 9 through 12. Both incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation were negatively associated with subsequent receipt of MOUD (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = (0.01, 0.24); 0.14 (0.04, 0.50), respectively) and HIV clinic engagement (aOR = 0.13, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.71); 0.09 (0.02, 0.39), respectively). In the final three months of the study, participants who were incarcerated had 42.5 fewer days of MOUD (95% CI = 23.1, 61.9), and participants in compulsory rehabilitation had 46.1 fewer days of MOUD (95% CI = 33.8, 58.4) than those not incarcerated or in compulsory rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that both incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation disrupt MOUD and HIV treatment among people with HIV and Opioid Use Disorder in Vietnam. Prioritization of evidence-based strategies to support engagement in care for people who use drugs could potentially expand HIV and Opioid Use Disorder treatment access and curb substance use more effectively than reliance on incarceration or compulsory rehabilitation.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;HIV;HIV Infections;Humans;Logistic Regression;Methadone;Models, Binomial;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Prisons;Rehabilitation;Rehabilitation Centers;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Vietnam;Vietnamese",HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

Data were from a multisite clinical trial comparing extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) with treatment as usual (TAU; buprenorphine or methadone) to achieve HIV viral suppression among people with OUD and uncontrolled HIV disease. The exposure of interest was fentanyl use, as measured by urine drug screening. Outcomes were time to MOUD initiation, defined as date of first injection of XR-NTX, buprenorphine prescription, or methadone administration; MOUD persistence, the total number of injections, prescriptions, or administrations received over 24 weeks; and MOUD retention, having an injection, prescription, or administration during weeks 20-24. Participants (N = 111) averaged 47 years old and 62% were male. Just over half (57%) were Black and 13% were Hispanic. Sixty-four percent of participants tested positive for fentanyl at baseline.

29410132,2018,Use of a prescription opioid registry to examine opioid misuse and overdose in an integrated health system.,"Strategies are needed to identify at-risk patients for adverse events associated with prescription opioids. This study identified prescription opioid misuse in an integrated health system using electronic health record (EHR) data, and examined predictors of misuse and overdose. The sample included patients from an EHR-based registry of adults who used prescription opioids in 2011 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care system. We characterized time-at-risk for opioid misuse and overdose, and used Cox proportional hazard models to model predictors of these events from 2011 to 2014. Among 396,452 patients, 2.7% were identified with opioid misuse and 1044 had an overdose event. Older patients were less likely to meet misuse criteria or have an overdose. Whites were more likely to be identified with misuse, but not to have an overdose. Alcohol and drug disorders were related to higher risk of misuse and overdose, with the exception that marijuana disorder was not related to opioid misuse. Higher daily opioid dosages and benzodiazepine use increased the risk of both opioid misuse and overdose. We characterized several risk factors associated with misuse and overdose using EHR-based data, which can be leveraged relatively quickly to inform preventive strategies to address the opioid crisis.","Address;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;California;Cannabis;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Drug Overdose;Electronic Health Records;Female;Health;Humans;Integrated Health Care Systems;Male;Middle Aged;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Registries;Risk;Risk Factors;Time;Whites",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse,Prev Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care
30676892,2019,The association between medical comorbidity and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of treatment initiation and engagement for alcohol and other drug use disorders.,"Background: Medical comorbidity may influence treatment initiation and engagement for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use disorders. We examined the association between medical comorbidity and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) treatment initiation and engagement measures.Methods: We used electronic health record and insurance claims data from 7 US health care systems to identify patients with AOD use disorders between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015 (N = 86,565). Among patients identified with AOD use disorders in outpatient and emergency department (ED) settings, we examined how Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index scores and medical complications of AOD use were associated with treatment initiation. Among those who initiated treatment in inpatient and outpatient/ED settings, we also examined how comorbidity and AOD use-related medical complications were associated with treatment engagement. Analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equation logistic regression modeling.Results: Among patients identified as having an AOD diagnosis in outpatient and ED settings (n = 69,965), Charlson/Deyo comorbidity index scores of 2 or more were independently associated with reduced likelihood of initiation (risk ratio [RR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.86; reference score = 0), whereas prior-year diagnoses of cirrhosis (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.35) and pancreatic disease (RR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.56) were associated with greater likelihood of initiation. Among those who were identified in outpatient/ED settings and initiated, higher comorbidity scores were associated with lower likelihood of engagement (score 1: RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.94; score 2+: RR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.71).Conclusion: Medical comorbidity was associated with lower likelihood of initiating or engaging in AOD treatment, but cirrhosis and pancreatic disease were associated with greater likelihood of initiation. Interventions to improve AOD treatment initiation and engagement for patients with comorbidities are needed, such as integrating medical and AOD treatment.","Adolescent;Adult;Alcohol-Induced Disorders;Alcohols;Ambulatory Care;Association;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cirrhosis;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Diagnosis;Digestive System Diseases;Drug Use Disorders;Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Endocrine System Diseases;Female;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Health Services Research;Hospitalization;Humans;Index;Indicators;Inpatients;Insurance;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Measures;Mental Disorders;Mental Health Services;Metabolic Diseases;Methods;Middle Aged;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Odds Ratio;Outpatients;Pancreatic Diseases;Patient Participation;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Respiratory Tract Diseases;Retrospective Studies;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Wounds and Injuries;Young Adult",Alcohol-Induced Disorders;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cirrhosis;Digestive System Diseases;Drug Use Disorders;Endocrine System Diseases;Mental Disorders;Metabolic Diseases;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Pancreatic Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;Substance-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care
30676931,2019,Predictors of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) treatment initiation and engagement among patients with opioid use disorder across 7 health systems.,"Background: The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) has increased rapidly in the United States and improving treatment access is critical. Among patients with OUD, we examined factors associated with the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment initiation and engagement. Methods: Electronic health record and claims data between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015, from 7 health systems were used to identify patients (n = 11,490) with a new index OUD diagnosis (no AOD diagnosis prior &lt;60 days) based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes. Multivariable generalized linear models with a logit link clustered on health system were used to examine the associations of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and department of index diagnosis, with HEDIS measures of treatment initiation and engagement. Results: The prevalence of OUD among all AOD diagnoses varied across health systems, as did rates of AOD initiation (5.7%-21.6%) and engagement (7.6%-24.6%). Those diagnosed in the emergency department (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27,1.97) or psychiatry/AOD treatment (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.47,3.46) were more likely to initiate treatment compared with primary care. Older patients were less likely to initiate (age 50-64 vs. age 18-29: aOR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.51; age 65+ vs. age 18-29: aOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.26, 0.43), as were women (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.85). Patients diagnosed in psychiatry/AOD treatment (aOR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.98, 3.60) compared with primary care were more likely to engage in treatment. Those identified in an inpatient setting (aOR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.27 vs. primary care), those with medical comorbidity (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.95), and older patients (age 50-64 vs. 18-29: aOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.88; age 65+ vs. 18-29: aOR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.57) were less likely to engage in treatment. Conclusions: Rates of initiation and engagement for OUD patients vary widely with noticeable room for improvement, particularly in this critical time of the opioid crisis. Targeting patient and system factors may improve health system performance, which is key to improving patient outcomes.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Alcohols;Association;Comorbidity;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Emergence Delirium;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Health;Health Care;Health Services Research;Humans;ICD-9;Index;Indicators;Inpatients;International Classification of Diseases;Linear Models;Male;Measures;Mental Health Services;Methods;Middle Aged;News;Odds Ratio;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patient Participation;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Psychiatry;Sex Factors;Therapeutics;Time;United States;Women;Young Adult",Emergence Delirium;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care
30908174,2019,Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of alcohol and drug treatment initiation and engagement among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and patients without an HIV diagnosis.,"Background: Problematic use of alcohol and other drugs (AOD) is highly prevalent among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH), and untreated AOD use disorders have particularly detrimental effects on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outcomes. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of treatment initiation and engagement are important benchmarks for access to AOD use disorder treatment. To inform improved patient care, we compared HEDIS measures of AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement and health care utilization among PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis. Methods: Patients with a new AOD use disorder diagnosis documented between October 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015, were identified using electronic health records (EHR) and insurance claims data from 7 health care systems in the United States. Demographic characteristics, clinical diagnoses, and health care utilization data were also obtained. AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement rates were calculated using HEDIS measure criteria. Factors associated with treatment initiation and engagement were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: There were 469 PLWH (93% male) and 86,096 patients without an HIV diagnosis (60% male) in the study cohort. AOD use disorder treatment initiation was similar in PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis (10% vs. 11%, respectively). Among those who initiated treatment, few engaged in treatment in both groups (9% PLWH vs. 12% patients without an HIV diagnosis). In multivariable analysis, HIV status was not significantly associated with either AOD use disorder treatment initiation or engagement. Conclusions: AOD use disorder treatment initiation and engagement rates were low in both PLWH and patients without an HIV diagnosis. Future studies need to focus on developing strategies to efficiently integrate AOD use disorder treatment with medical care for HIV.",Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcohols;Ambulatory Care;Benchmarks;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Demography;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Female;Future;HIV;HIV Infections;Health Care;Health Care Systems;Health Services Research;Hospitalization;Humans;Insurance;Logistic Regression;Male;Measures;Mental Health Services;Methods;Middle Aged;Needs;News;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient Care;Patient Participation;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult,HIV Infections;Substance-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care

32126455,2020,"The role of substance use disorders in experiencing a repeat opioid overdose, and substance use treatment patterns among patients with a non-fatal opioid overdose.","A non-fatal opioid overdose (NFOO) increases the risk of another overdose and identifies high-risk patients. We estimated the risk of repeat opioid overdose for patients with and without substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses and the change in substance use treatment utilization rates associated with the first NFOO. We selected patients (&gt;18 years of age) from Kaiser Permanente Northern California with a NFOO between 2009-2016 (n = 3,992). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the 1-year risk of opioid overdose associated with SUD diagnoses (opioid, alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine, sedative, and cocaine), controlling for patient characteristics. Among patients with an index NFOO, we calculated monthly utilization rates for outpatient substance use services and buprenorphine before and after the index overdose. Interrupted time series models estimated the change in level and trend in utilization rates associated with the index overdose. Approximately 7.2 % of patients had a repeat opioid overdose during the year after the index NFOO. The only SUD diagnosis significantly associated with greater risk of repeat overdose was opioid use disorder (OUD) (aHR: 1.51; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.01). Before the index overdose, 4.16 % of patients received outpatient substance use services and 1.32 % received buprenorphine. The index overdose was associated with a 5.94 % (standard error: 0.77 %) absolute increase in outpatient substance use services and a 1.29 % (standard error: 0.15 %) increase in buprenorphine. Patients with a NFOO and OUD are vulnerable to another overdose. Low initiation rates for substance use treatment after a NFOO indicate a need to address patient, provider, and system barriers.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcohols;Amphetamine;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;California;Cannabis;Cocaine;Cohort Studies;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Female;Humans;Index;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Male;Middle Aged;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Risk;Role;Sedatives;Standards;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care
32293514,2020,Addressing identification bias in the design and analysis of cluster-randomized pragmatic trials: a case study.,"Pragmatic trials provide the opportunity to study the effectiveness of health interventions to improve care in real-world settings. However, use of open-cohort designs with patients becoming eligible after randomization and reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) to identify participants may lead to a form of selection bias referred to as identification bias. This bias can occur when individuals identified as a result of the treatment group assignment are included in analyses. To demonstrate the importance of identification bias and how it can be addressed, we consider a motivating case study, the PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) Trial. PROUD is an ongoing pragmatic, cluster-randomized implementation trial in six health systems to evaluate a program for increasing medication treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs). A main study objective is to evaluate whether the PROUD intervention decreases acute care utilization among patients with OUD (effectiveness aim). Identification bias is a particular concern, because OUD is underdiagnosed in the EHR at baseline, and because the intervention is expected to increase OUD diagnosis among current patients and attract new patients with OUD to the intervention site. We propose a framework for addressing this source of bias in the statistical design and analysis. The statistical design sought to balance the competing goals of fully capturing intervention effects and mitigating identification bias, while maximizing power. For the primary analysis of the effectiveness aim, identification bias was avoided by defining the study sample using pre-randomization data (pre-trial modeling demonstrated that the optimal approach was to use individuals with a prior OUD diagnosis). To expand generalizability of study findings, secondary analyses were planned that also included patients newly diagnosed post-randomization, with analytic methods to account for identification bias. As more studies seek to leverage existing data sources, such as EHRs, to make clinical trials more affordable and generalizable and to apply novel open-cohort study designs, the potential for identification bias is likely to become increasingly common. This case study highlights how this bias can be addressed in the statistical study design and analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03407638.

36318205,2022,Validity of the Single-Item Screen-Cannabis (SIS-C) for Cannabis Use Disorder Screening in Routine Care.,"Cannabis use is prevalent and increasing, and frequent use intensifies the risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD). CUD is underrecognized in medical settings, but a validated single-item cannabis screen could increase recognition. To evaluate the Single-Item Screen-Cannabis (SIS-C), administered and documented in routine primary care, compared with a confidential reference standard measure of CUD. This diagnostic study included a sample of adult patients who completed routine cannabis screening between January 28 and September 12, 2019, and were randomly selected for a confidential survey about cannabis use. Random sampling was stratified by frequency of past-year use and race and ethnicity. The study was conducted at an integrated health system in Washington state, where adult cannabis use is legal. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to March 2022. The SIS-C asks about frequency of past-year cannabis use with responses (none, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, daily or almost daily) documented in patients' medical records. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM) for past-year CUD was completed on a confidential survey and considered the reference standard. The SIS-C was compared with 2 or more criteria on the CIDI-SAM, consistent with CUD. All analyses were weighted, accounting for survey design and nonresponse, to obtain estimates representative of the health system primary care population. Of 5000 sampled adult patients, 1688 responded to the cannabis survey (34% response rate). Patients were predominantly middle-aged (weighted mean [SD] age, 50.7 [18.1]), female or women (weighted proportion [SE], 55.9% [4.1]), non-Hispanic (weighted proportion [SE], 96.7% [1.0]), and White (weighted proportion [SE], 74.2% [3.7]). Approximately 6.6% of patients met criteria for past-year CUD. The SIS-C had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96) for identifying CUD. A threshold of less than monthly cannabis use balanced sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.83) for detecting CUD. In populations with a 6% prevalence of CUD, predictive values of a positive screen ranged from 17% to 34%, while predictive values of a negative screen ranged from 97% to 100%. In this diagnostic study, the SIS-C had excellent performance characteristics in routine care as a screen for CUD. While high negative predictive values suggest that the SIS-C accurately identifies patients without CUD, low positive predictive values indicate a need for further diagnostic assessment following positive results when screening for CUD in primary care.",Accounting;Adult;Cannabis;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Ethnic Groups;Female;Health;Hispanics;Humans;Interview;Marijuana Abuse;Mass Screening;Measures;Medical Records;Middle Aged;Needs;Negative Predictive Value;Patients;Population;Positive Predictive Value;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Racial Stocks;Receiver Operating Characteristic;Reference Standards;Risk;Screening;Sensitivity;Specificity;Substance Abuse;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Washington;Whites;Women,Marijuana Abuse;Mental Disorders;Substance Abuse;Substance-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care
30091814,2018,Cognitive functioning and treatment outcomes in a randomized controlled trial of internet-delivered drug and alcohol treatment.,"Substance use disorders are associated with lower cognitive functioning, and this impairment is associated with poorer outcomes. The Therapeutic Education System (TES) is an internet-based psychosocial intervention for substance use disorders that may provide enhanced treatment for individuals with cognitive deficits. This secondary analysis investigates the association between cognitive functioning and treatment outcomes in a large (N = 507) randomized controlled effectiveness trial of TES compared to treatment-as-usual conducted within outpatient programs in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. All participants completed a computer-based cognitive assessment (Microcog™ short version) at baseline. Scores on subtests of attention, reasoning, and spatial perception were tested as moderators of the treatment effect on abstinence and retention at the end of the 12-week treatment phase using mixed effects logistic regression. Cognitive functioning was not found to be a moderator of treatment on abstinence or retention. Post-hoc analysis of the main effect of cognitive functioning on retention and abstinence found impaired reasoning and cognitive flexibility were associated with lower retention. There were no other main effects of cognitive functioning on retention or abstinence. The benefit of internet delivered treatment over standard care was unchanged across a range of cognitive functioning. Consistent with previous research, mild to moderate impairment in reasoning and cognitive flexibility were associated with lower retention across both treatment arms. An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention for substance use disorders, TES, is equally effective across a spectrum of cognitive functioning among diverse patients.

There are currently three World Health Organization-recommended and US Food and Drug Administration-approved medication treatments for opioid use disorder: the full opioid agonist methadone, the opioid partial agonist buprenorphine, and the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. We provide a review of the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and discuss the barriers, challenges, risks, and efficacy of buprenorphine treatment vs. other treatments. Although evidence from numerous studies has shown buprenorphine to be effective for the treatment of opioid use disorder, a majority of patients with opioid use disorder do not receive buprenorphine, or any other medical treatment. We review the different formulations of buprenorphine, including newer long-acting injectable formulations that may decrease the risk of diversion and improve adherence.",Affect;Buprenorphine;Full Opioid Agonists;Humans;Injectables;Medication Adherence;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Partial Opioid Agonists;Patients;Review;Risk;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States Food and Drug Administration;World Health Organization,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,CNS Drugs,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
31313402,2020,Opioid use and dropout from extended-release naltrexone in a controlled trial: implications for mechanism.,"Extended-release formulations of naltrexone have emerged as effective treatment options for opioid use disorder. This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness. This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections. We analyzed time to dropout from treatment using survival analysis with an extended Cox model as a function of treatment (XR-NTX versus placebo) and with weekly urine drug test (UDT) results for opioids at each week as a time-dependent covariate. Thirteen addiction treatment programs in Russia, 2008-09. A total of 250 adults with opioid use disorder who had completed in-patient detoxification. XR-NTX injection or placebo injection every 4 weeks with weekly clinic visits and biweekly counseling. Urine toxicology for opioids measured weekly and week of dropout from treatment. The Cox model yielded a significant interaction of time-dependent urine toxicology by treatment (P = 0.024). Among patients receiving placebo, a positive UDT in a given week increased the risk for dropout from treatment in the subsequent week [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.6-10.0], whereas among patients receiving XR-NTX, a positive UDT result showed no significant effect on risk for dropout (HR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.6-4.5). The proportion of patients who completed all 24 weeks without any positive UDT result was 31% on XR-NTX compared with 20% on placebo (P = 0.051). Extended-release injection naltrexone was effective at reducing the risk of dropout from opioid use disorder treatment after an episode of opioid use. Just under a third of patients (31%) on XR-NTX had no opioid-positive urine tests across the trial, but the hypothesis that this would differ from placebo (20%) was not confirmed.","Adult;Ambulatory Care;Clinic Visits;Clinical Effectiveness;Confidence Intervals;Counseling;Cox Models;Delayed-Action Preparations;Double-Blind Method;Duration of Therapy;Female;Humans;Injections;Male;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Dropouts;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placebos;Program;Receptors, Opioid;Relapse;Risk;Russia;Survival Analysis;Sustained-Release Preparations;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Treatment Outcome;Urine",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
31414355,2019,Screening for Substance Use in Rural Primary Care: a Qualitative Study of Providers and Patients.,"Substance use frequently goes undetected in primary care. Though barriers to implementing systematic screening for alcohol and drug use have been examined in urban settings, less is known about screening in rural primary care. To identify current screening practices, barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for the implementation of substance use screening in rural federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). As part of a multi-phase study implementing electronic health record-integrated screening, focus groups (n = 60: all stakeholder groups) and individual interviews (n = 10 primary care providers (PCPs)) were conducted. Three stakeholder groups (PCPs, medical assistants (MAs), and patients) at three rural FQHCs in Maine. Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Themes surrounding current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for implementation were identified and organized by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework. Identifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment. Though stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context. Findings highlight that strong relationships with providers are critical for patients, while in-clinic resources and training are needed to increase provider comfort and preparedness to address substance use.",Address;Adult;Alcohols;Classification;Disclosure;Electronic Health Records;Face;Female;Focus Groups;Health;Health Personnel;Humans;Interview;Judgment;Knowledge;Maine;Male;Middle Aged;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Primary Health Care;Privacy;Qualitative Research;Resources;Rural Population;Screening;Self;Stakeholder Participation;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Tablets;Therapeutics;Trust,Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
32233747,2020,Exploring gender differences among treatment-seekers who use opioids versus alcohol and other drugs.,"Identifying clinical differences between opioid users (OU) and alcohol and other drug users (AOD) may help to tailor treatment to OU, particularly among the majority of OU who are not on opioid agonist treatments. Given the dearth of research on these differences, this study explored gender differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between OU and AOD. Participants (N = 506) were from a multisite, randomized controlled clinical trial of an Internet-delivered psychosocial intervention conducted in 2010-2011. Logistic regression models explored differences in demographic and clinical characteristics by substance use category within and between women and men. Women OU were more likely to be younger, White, employed, benzodiazepine users, and less likely to have children or use cocaine and cannabis than women AOD. Men OU, compared to men AOD, were more likely to be younger, White, younger at first abuse/dependence, benzodiazepine users, and reported greater psychological distress, but were less likely to be involved in criminal justice or use stimulants. Interactions by gender and substance use were also detected for age of first abuse/dependence, employment, and criminal justice involvement. These findings provide a nuanced understanding of gender differences within substance use groups to inform providers for OU seeking treatment.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Distribution;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Cannabis;Child;Cocaine;Comprehension;Controlled Clinical Trial;Criminal Justice;Demography;Drug Users;Employment;Female;Gender;Humans;Internet;Logistic Regression;Male;Men;Middle Aged;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Psychological Distress;Psychosocial Intervention;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Research;Sex Characteristics;Sex Distribution;Sex Factors;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;United States;Whites;Women",Alcohol-Related Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Women Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"

32956164,2020,Digital Clinical Trials for Substance Use Disorders in the Age of Covid-19.,": As a result of the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, clinical research for substance use disorders (SUDs) has been impeded due to widespread stay-at-home mandates limiting the operations of ""non-essential"" work. Although appropriate to proceed with an abundance of caution to prevent viral spread, there will be detrimental consequences for patients with SUDs if clinical trials research cannot adapt and continue uninterrupted. The field of digital health has strong evidence for its feasibility and effectiveness and offers tools that can facilitate the continuation of SUD clinical trials research remotely in accordance with Covid-19 precautions. Some digital tools have been used as components of SUD research in the past; however, no published clinical trial in SUDs to-date has been entirely virtual. This has important implications for disrupted clinical care, as providers seek guidelines for best digital practices. This paper provides a roadmap for integrating the fields of digital health and SUD clinical trials by proposing methods to complete recruitment, screening, informed consent, other study procedures, and internal lab operations digitally. The immediate future of SUD research depends on the ability to comply with social distancing. Investment in research of digital clinical trials for SUDs provides an opportunity to cultivate benefits for research and clinical care long-term as we can (1) define regulatory requirements for the implementation of digital systems, (2) develop consensus on system-wide standards and protocols in the appropriate use of technology, and (3) gain experience that can translate to the treatment of patients with SUDs through telehealth in the community.","Ability;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Clinical Trial;Clinical Trials as Topic;Community;Consensus;Coronavirus;Coronavirus Infections;Dates;Future;Guideline;Health;Humans;Infection Control;Informed Consent;Investments;Long-Term Care;Methods;Pandemics;Paper;Patient Selection;Patients;Physical Distancing;Pneumonia, Viral;Procedures;Research;Screening;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Technology;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Work","COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Coronavirus Infections;Infections;Pneumonia, Viral;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders",J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33264087,2021,Early implementation of screening for substance use in rural primary care: A rapid analytic qualitative study.,"Background: Few primary care patients are screened for substance use. As part of a phased feasibility study examining the implementation of electronic health record-integrated screening with the Tobacco, Alcohol, and Prescription Medication Screening (TAPS) Tool and clinical decision support (CDS) in rural primary care clinics, focus groups were conducted to identify early indicators of success and challenges to screening implementation. Method: Focus groups (n = 6) were conducted with medical assistants (MAs: n = 3: 19 participants) and primary care providers (PCPs: n = 3: 13 participants) approximately one month following screening implementation in three Federally Qualified Health Centers in Maine. Rapid analysis and matrix analysis using Proctor's Taxonomy of Implementation Outcomes were used to explore implementation outcomes. Results: There was consensus that screening is being used, but use of the CDS was lower, in part due to limited positive screens. Fidelity was high among MAs, though discomfort with the CDS surfaced among PCPs, impacting adoption and fidelity. The TAPS Tool's content, credibility and ease of workflow integration were favorably assessed. Challenges include screening solely at annual visits and self-administered screening for certain patients. Conclusions: Results reveal indicators of implementation success and strategies to address challenges to screening for substance use in primary care.",Address;Adoption;Alcohols;Clinical Decision Support;Consensus;Electronic Health Records;Feasibility Studies;Focus Groups;Health;Humans;Indicators;Maine;Mass Screening;Methods;Patients;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Qualitative Research;Rural Population;Screening;Self;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Taxonomy;Tobacco;Workflow,Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
33750454,2021,"Implementation facilitation to introduce and support emergency department-initiated buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in high need, low resource settings: protocol for multi-site implementation-feasibility study.","For many reasons, the emergency department (ED) is a critical venue to initiate OUD interventions. The prevailing culture of the ED has been that substance use disorders are non-emergent conditions better addressed outside the ED where resources are less constrained. This study, its rapid funding mechanism, and accelerated timeline originated out of the urgent need to learn whether ED-initiated buprenorphine (BUP) with referral for treatment of OUD is generalizable, as well as to develop strategies to facilitate its adoption across a variety of ED settings and under real-world conditions. It both complements and uses methods adapted from Project ED Health (CTN-0069), a Hybrid Type 3 implementation-effectiveness study of using Implementation Facilitation (IF) to integrate ED-initiated BUP and referral programs. ED-CONNECT (CTN 0079) was a three-site implementation study exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of introducing ED-initiated BUP in rural and urban settings with high-need, limited resources, and different staffing structures. We used a multi-faceted approach to develop, introduce and iteratively refine site-specific ED clinical protocols and implementation plans for opioid use disorder (OUD) screening, ED-initiated BUP, and referral for treatment. We employed a participatory action research approach and use mixed methods incorporating data derived from abstraction of medical records and administrative data, assessments of recruited ED patient-participants, and both qualitative and quantitative inquiry involving staff from the ED and community, patients, and other stakeholders. This study was designed to provide the necessary, time-sensitive understanding of how to identify OUD and initiate treatment with BUP in the EDs previously not providing ED-initiated BUP, in communities in which this intervention is most needed: high need, low resource settings.

34138594,2022,Graded response item response theory in scaling suicidal thoughts and behaviors among trauma-exposed women with substance use disorders.,"Objective: The co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUD) and trauma-exposure is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, traditional methods of measurement for suicidal thoughts and behaviors are limited by an overreliance on dichotomous (i.e., yes or no) and averaged/summed scale score measurements. Further, among trauma-exposed individuals with SUD, it remains unclear which specific demographic factors, types of SUDs, and trauma sequelae (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptom clusters) may be associated with elevated STB. The present study utilized item response theory to (a) generate empirically derived STB severity scores and, (b) examine which demographic factors, SUD diagnoses, and DSM-IV PTSD symptom clusters are associated with suicidality in a trauma-exposed sample with SUDs. Method: Female trauma-exposed participants with SUDs (N = 544) were recruited from community substance use treatment facilities in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Clinician-administered interviews assessed STB, SUDs, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Results indicated that the unidimensional item response theory (IRT) model used to estimate latent STB severity scores fit well, with strong local reliability at higher levels of latent STB severity. Regression predictors of elevated STB severity included younger age, opioid dependence, and higher PTSD reexperiencing symptoms. Conclusions: Clinicians are advised to screen for and target opioid use disorders and reexperiencing symptoms when addressing suicidal thoughts and behavior in trauma-exposed individuals with SUDs.

34366201,2022,Engagement patterns with a digital therapeutic for substance use disorders: Correlations with abstinence outcomes.,"Patient engagement may play a key role in the success or failure of treatments for substance use disorder (SUD). This exploratory analysis of data from a large, multisite effectiveness trial (NCT01104805) sought to determine how patient engagement with a digital therapeutic for SUD delivered at clinics was associated with abstinence outcomes. The study evaluated engagement for 206 participants enrolled in a treatment program for SUDs related to cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, or other stimulants who were randomized to receive treatment as usual (TAU) or reduced TAU plus the digital Therapeutic Education System (TES) for 12 weeks. Participants were eligible for contingency management incentives for module completion (modules cover Community Reinforcement Approach topic areas) and negative urine drug screens. Analyses examined the association of module completion with end-of-treatment abstinence. Participants completed a mean of 38.8 (range 0-72) TES modules over 12 weeks of treatment. Study completers (n = 157) completed a mean of 45.5 (range 9-72) TES modules, whereas study noncompleters (n = 49) completed a mean of 17.4 (range 0-45) TES modules. The study observed a strong positive correlation between TES engagement (i.e., total number of modules completed) and the probability of abstinence during weeks 9-12 of treatment among 157 study completers (OR = 1.11; 95% CI 1.08-1.14). Each module completed increased the odds of abstinence during weeks 9-12 by approximately 11% for study completers and 9% for the full sample. The study observed a similar, but weaker, association between engagement and abstinence among 49 patients who did not complete the study (OR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.98-1.07). Greater engagement with a digital therapeutic for patients with SUD (i.e., number of modules completed over time) was strongly associated with the probability of abstinence in the last four weeks of treatment among those who completed the recommended 12-week treatment.

There remains a dearth of research evaluating methods for effectively implementing treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) within these communities. We describe proceedings from a 2-day Collaborative Board (CB) meeting tasked with developing an implementation intervention for AI/AN clinical programs to improve the delivery of medications to treat OUD (MOUD). The CB was comprised of Elders, cultural leaders, providers, individuals with lived experience with OUD, and researchers from over 25 communities, organizations, and academic institutions. Conversations were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by two academic researchers with interpretation oversight provided by the CB. These proceedings provided a foundation for ongoing CB work and a frame for developing the program-level implementation intervention using a strength-based and holistic model of OUD recovery and wellbeing. Topics of discussion posed to the CB included engagement and recovery strategies, integration of extended family traditions, and addressing stigma and building trust with providers and clients. Integration of traditional healing practices, ceremonies, and other cultural practices was recommended. The importance of centering AI/AN culture and involving family were highlighted as priorities for the intervention.",Adult;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Clients;Community;Community-Based Participatory Research;Culture;Epidemics;Extended Family;Family;Foundations;Implementation Science;Methods;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Organizations;Program;Research;Research Personnel;Therapeutics;Trust;Work,Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder,Am J Community Psychol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"
36645265,2023,Trajectories of depression among patients in treatment for opioid use disorder: A growth mixture model secondary analysis of the XBOT trial.,"To inform clinical practice, we identified subgroups of adults based on levels of depression symptomatology over time during opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. Participants were 474 adults in a 24-week treatment trial for OUD. Depression symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at nine-time points. This was a secondary analysis of the Clinical Trials Network Extended-Release Naltrexone versus Buprenorphine for Opioid Treatment (XBOT) trial using a growth mixture model. Three distinct depression trajectories were identified: Class 1 High Recurring-10% with high HAM-D with initial partial reductions (of HAM-D across time), Class 2 Persistently High-5% with persistently high HAM-D, and Class 3 Low Declining-85% of the participants, with low HAM-D with early sustained reductions. The majority (low declining) had levels of depression that improved in the first 4 weeks and then stabilized across the treatment period. In contrast, 15% (high recurring and persistently high) had high initial levels that were more variable across time. The persistently high class had higher rates of opioid relapse. In this OUD sample, most depressive symptomatology was mild and improved after medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Smaller subgroups had higher depressive symptoms that persisted or recurred after the initiation of MOUD. Depressive symptoms should be followed in patients initiating treatment for OUD, and when persistent, should prompt further evaluation and consideration of antidepressant treatment. This study is the first to identify three distinct depression trajectories among a large clinical sample of individuals in MOUD treatment.",Adult;Antidepressive Agents;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Depression;Depressive Symptoms;Growth;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Relapse;Scales;Therapeutics;Time,Opioid Use Disorder;Relapse,Am J Addict,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Management of Unhealthy Opioid and Polysubstance use Among Patients in Primary Care;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP);Optimizing the Duration, Retention, and Discontinuation of Medication Treatment"

29272165,2018,Treatment and Prevention of Opioid Use Disorder: Challenges and Opportunities.,"Treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States evolved in response to changing federal policy and advances in science. Inpatient care began in 1935 with the US Public Health Service Hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort Worth, Texas. Outpatient clinics emerged in the 1960s to provide aftercare. Research advances led to opioid agonist and opioid antagonist therapies. When patients complete opioid withdrawal, return to use is often rapid and frequently deadly. US and international authorities recommend opioid agonist therapy (i.e., methadone or buprenorphine). Opioid antagonist therapy (i.e., extended-release naltrexone) may also inhibit return to use. Prevention efforts emphasize public and prescriber education, use of prescription drug monitoring programs, and safe medication disposal options. Overdose education and naloxone distribution promote access to rescue medication and reduce opioid overdose fatalities.

29407684,2018,Menthol cigarette smoking among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders.,"There are higher rates of menthol cigarette smoking within certain population subgroups. Limited research has examined menthol use among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders (SUD), a population with a high prevalence of cigarette smoking, poor smoking cessation outcomes, and high tobacco disease burden. Survey data were collected from 863 smokers sampled from 24 SUD treatment programs affiliated with the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in the United States. Prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking was examined for the sample. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine demographic and tobacco use characteristics associated with menthol cigarette smoking. Overall, the prevalence of menthol smoking among individuals in SUD treatment was 53.3%. Smoking menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes was associated with being female (AOR=1.61, p=0.003), African American (AOR=7.89, p&lt;0.001), Hispanic/Latino (AOR=3.39, p&lt;0.001), and lower odds of having a college degree (AOR=0.49, p=0.015). Controlling for demographic factors, menthol smokers were more likely to report marijuana (AOR=3.33, p&lt;0.007) as their primary drug compared to alcohol. Lastly, menthol smokers were more likely to report interest in getting help for quitting smoking (AOR=1.53, p=0.01), although they were not more likely to report making a past year quit attempt. In conclusion, use of menthol cigarettes was higher among smokers in SUD treatment than in general population smokers. Regulatory policies targeting the manufacture, marketing, or sale of menthol cigarettes may benefit vulnerable populations, including smokers in SUD treatment.","Adult;African Americans;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Cannabis;Cigarette Smoking;Cigarettes;Clinical Trial;Cost of Illness;Demography;Educational Status;Factors, Demographic;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Latinos;Logistic Models;Male;Marijuana Abuse;Marketing;Menthol;Middle Aged;Motivation;Multivariate Analysis;Nicotine;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Program;Public Policy;Report;Research;Sales;Smokers;Smoking;Smoking Cessation;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Tobacco Products;Tobacco Use;United States;Vulnerable Populations;Whites",Alcoholism;Marijuana Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29486419,2018,"Cross-sectional cause of death comparisons for stimulant and opioid mortality in San Francisco, 2005-2015.","Opioids and stimulants (e.g., cocaine or methamphetamine/amphetamine [MAMP]) are major contributors to acute substance toxicity deaths. Causes of stimulant death have received little attention. We sought to characterize and compare causes of death and significant contributing conditions among persons who died from acute opioid, cocaine, or MAMP toxicity. We identified all opioid, cocaine, or MAMP deaths in San Francisco from 2005 to 2015 through the California Electronic Death Reporting System. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations between acute substance toxicity deaths (opioid versus stimulant; cocaine versus MAMP), additional reported causes of death, and significant contributing conditions most often linked to opioid and stimulant use. From 2005-2015, there were 1252 opioid deaths and 749 stimulant deaths. Cocaine accounted for most stimulant deaths. Decedents with cardiac or cerebral hemorrhage deaths had higher adjusted odds of death due to acute stimulant toxicity versus acute opioid toxicity (aOR = 4.79, 95%CI = 2.88-7.96, p &lt; 0.01; aOR = 58.58, 95%CI = 21.06-162.91, p &lt; 0.01, respectively); no statistically significant associations were found for cocaine compared to MAMP deaths. Significant contributing cardiac conditions were associated with higher adjusted odds of stimulant compared to opioid (aOR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.19-1.79, p &lt; 0.01) and cocaine compared to MAMP death (aOR = 1.66, 95%CI = 1.13-2.45, p = .01). Stimulant compared to opioid deaths tended to involve cardiac or cerebrovascular causes of death, and cocaine deaths were more likely than MAMP deaths to involve significant contributing cardiac conditions.

29754987,2018,A statewide effort to reduce high-dose opioid prescribing through coordinated care organizations.,"Oregon's Medicaid program is delivered through 16 Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) participating in a statewide performance improvement program to reduce high-dose opioid prescribing. CCOs were allowed flexibility to develop their own dose targets and any policies, trainings, guidelines, and/or materials to meet these targets. In this study, we characterize CCO strategies to reduce high-dose opioid prescribing across the 16 CCOs. We reviewed relevant CCO documents and conducted semi-structured interviews with CCO administrators to acquire opioid-related policies, practices, timelines and contextual factors. We applied a systematic coding procedure to develop a comprehensive description of each CCO's strategy. We used administrative data from the state to summarize contextual utilization data for each CCO. Most CCOs selected a target daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dose of 90 mg. Sixteen issued quantity limits related to dose, eight restricted specific drug formulations (short-acting or long-acting), and 11 allowed for time-limited taper plan periods for patients over threshold. Many CCOs also employed provider trainings, feedback reports, and/or onsite technical assistance. Other innovations included incentive measures, electronic health record alerts, and toolkits with materials on local alternative therapy resources and strategies for patient communication. CCOs leveraging collaborations with regional partners appeared to mount a greater intensity of interventions than independently operating CCOs. CCOs developed a diversity of interventions to confront high-risk opioid prescribing within their organization. As healthcare systems mount interventions to reduce risky opioid prescribing, it is critical to carefully describe these activities and examine their impact on process and health outcomes.","Administrators;Alternative Therapies;Analgesics, Opioid;Classification;Coding;Communication;Community Health Services;Drug Formulation;Electronic Health Records;Feedback;Guideline;Health;Health Care Systems;Humans;Incentives;Interview;Measures;Medicaid;Morphine;Opioids;Oregon;Organizational Policy;Organizations;Pain Management;Patients;Pliability;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Procedures;Program;Report;Resources;Risk;Safety;Time;United States",Pain,Addict Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29807248,2018,Quantity fluctuations of illicitly used opioids and overdose risk.,"Reduced opioid tolerance is believed to be associated with overdose risk, although this relationship has primarily been examined in the context of gaps and frequency of opioid use. We sought to assess how changes in the quantity of opioids used, as opposed to periods of abstinence or overall frequency of use, relate to overdose risk. Among repeated visits of participants of a behavioral intervention trial from 2014 to 2016, we used multivariable logistic regression models fit with generalized estimating equations to examine the relationship between the percentage of opioid use days on which individuals used more or less than the quantity they used on average (i.e., quantity volatility) and the occurrence of opioid overdose. Our sample included 290 four-month reporting periods among 63 participants (67% male). Opioid overdose events were reported by 28 (44%) participants during 48 (17%) reporting periods. Our measure of quantity volatility had a median of 20% (IQR 0.0-50.0). In multivariable analysis, using a quantity different than the quantity used on average on more than 20% of all opioid use days in the reporting period was significantly associated with odds of any opioid overdose (Adjusted OR = 3.55, 95%CI = 1.55-8.13, p = 0.003), controlling for confounders. Quantity volatility of illicitly used opioids was positively associated with overdose risk and may contribute to the complex system of overlapping factors that influence overdose risk.

The Medication Research Partnership (MRP) was a successful effort to promote adoption of pharmacotherapy for opioid and alcohol use disorders in nine substance abuse treatment centers and a commercial health plan. This qualitative analysis of interviews (n = 39) conducted with change leaders at baseline and at the end/beginning of 6-month change cycles explains how treatment centers overcame obstacles to the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of pharmacotherapy. Results show that barriers to adopting, implementing, and sustaining pharmacotherapy can be overcome through incremental testing of organizational change strategies, accompanied by expert coaching and a learning community of like-minded professionals. The greatest challenges lie in overcoming abstinence-only philosophies, establishing a business case for pharmacotherapy, and working with payers and pharmaceutical representatives.","Adoption;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Analgesics, Opioid;Attitude of Health Personnel;Buprenorphine;Business;Change, Organizational;Coaching;Community;Drug Therapy;Health;Health Personnel;Humans;Interprofessional Relations;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Learning;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizational Innovation;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Philosophy;Research;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics",Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcohol-Related Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders,J Behav Health Serv Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29908763,2018,Acceptability and feasibility of naloxone prescribing in primary care settings: A systematic review.,"Naloxone access through established healthcare settings is critical to responding to the opioid crisis. We conducted a systematic review to assess the acceptability and feasibility of prescribing naloxone to patients in primary care. We queried PubMed, EmBase and CINAHL for US-based, peer-reviewed, full-length, original articles relating to acceptability or feasibility of prescribing naloxone in primary care. Searches yielded 270 unduplicated articles; one analyst reviewed all titles and abstracts. Two analysts independently reviewed eligible articles for study design, study outcome, and acceptability and/or feasibility. Analyses were compared and a third reviewer consulted if discrepancies emerged. Seventeen articles were included. Providers' willingness to prescribe naloxone appeared to increase over time. Most studies provided prescribers in-person naloxone trainings, including how to write a prescription and indications for prescribing. Most studies implemented universal prescribing, whereby anyone prescribed long-term opioids or otherwise at risk for overdose was eligible for naloxone. Patient education was largely provided by prescribers and most studies provided take-home educational materials. Providers reported concerns around naloxone prescribing including lack of knowledge around prescribing and educating patients. Providers also reported benefits such as improving difficult conversations around opioids and resetting the culture around opioids and overdose. Current literature supports the acceptability and feasibility of naloxone prescribing in primary care. Provision of naloxone through primary care may help normalize such medication safety interventions, support larger opioid stewardship efforts, and expand access to patients not served by a community distribution program.","Abstracts;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Culture;Drug Overdose;Health Care;Humans;Knowledge;Literature;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome Studies;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Persons;Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Program;PubMed;Risk;Safety;Systematic Review;Time",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Prev Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29917118,2019,Considering Systemic Barriers to Treating Tobacco Use in Clinical Settings in the United States.,"The Comorbidity Workgroup of the Tobacco Treatment Research Network, within the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, previously highlighted the need to provide tobacco treatment to patients diagnosed with comorbid physical and mental health conditions. Yet, systemic barriers in the United States health care system prevent many patients who present for medical treatment from getting the evidence-based tobacco treatment that they need. The identified barriers include insufficient training in the epidemiologic impact of tobacco use, related disorders, and pharmacological and behavioral treatment approaches; misunderstanding among clinicians about the effectiveness of tobacco treatment; lack of therapeutic support from clinical staff; insufficient use of health information technology to improve tobacco use identification and treatment; and limited time and reimbursement for clinicians to provide treatment. We highlight three vignettes demonstrating the complexities of practical barriers at the health care system level. We consider each of the barriers in turn and discuss evidence-based strategies that could be implemented in the clinical care of patients with comorbid conditions. In addition, in the absence of compelling data to guide implementation approaches, we offer suggestions for potential strategies and avenues for future research. Implications: Three vignettes highlighted in this article illustrate some systemic barriers to providing tobacco treatment for patients being treated for comorbid conditions. We explore the barriers to tobacco treatment and offer suggestions for changes in training, health care systems, clinical workflow, and payment systems that could enhance the reach and the quality of tobacco treatment within the US health care system.",Communication Barriers;Comorbidity;Future;Health Care Systems;Health Information Technology;Humans;Mental Health;Needs;Nicotine;Patients;Research;Smoking Cessation;Societies;Suggestion;Therapeutics;Time;Tobacco;Tobacco Use;Tobacco Use Disorder;United States;Workflow,Tobacco Use Disorder,Nicotine Tob Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29948609,2018,Implementing Treatment of Opioid-Use Disorder in Rural Settings: a Focus on HIV and Hepatitis C Prevention and Treatment.,To describe the epidemiology of opioid-use disorder in the rural United States (U.S.) as it pertains to HIV and hepatitis C transmission and treatment resources. Heroin and fentanyl analogs have surpassed prescription opioids in their availability in rural opioid markets adding to HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) and overdose risks. Only 18% of rural individuals live in towns with inpatient services which are of limited quality and utility. Opioid treatment programs that provide methadone are not located in rural areas and only 3% of the primary care providers have the ability to prescribe buprenorphine. National models and resources have been established but lack implementation in rural areas leading to ongoing HIV and HCV transmission and overdose.

30570409,2019,Relationship between Tobacco Use and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among Clients in Substance Use Disorders Treatment.,"We examined relationships of smoking status and tobacco-related variables with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a metric of disease burden, among clients in substance use disorders (SUDs) treatment. Participants (N = 2,068; 46.6% female) completed surveys reporting demographics, smoking status, and past-month days they experienced physical and/or mental health distress. Smokers (n = 1,596; 77.2% of sample) answered questions on tobacco-related variables. Multinomial regression models assessed relationships between tobacco-related variables (smoking status, nicotine dependence, menthol smoking, electronic-cigarette use, health concerns, and cost as reasons affecting reducing/quitting smoking, past and future quit attempts) with HRQol in four categories (good health, physical health distress, mental health distress, or both physical and mental health distress). Current smokers were more likely than former smokers to report frequent physical and mental health distress than good health (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.16, 3.34), as were smokers with higher nicotine dependence (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.35). Smokers reporting both frequent physical and mental health distress were more sensitive to cigarettes' cost (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.29), and less likely to use e-cigarettes (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38, 0.94). Findings of poor HRQoL among nicotine-dependent smokers with additional SUDs strengthen the imperative to provide smoking cessation interventions in addictions treatment.","Behavior, Addictive;Benchmarks;Cigarettes;Clients;Cost;Cost of Illness;Demography;Electronic Cigarette Use;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems;Female;Future;Health;Health-Related Quality Of Life;Humans;Male;Mental Health;Menthol;Nicotine;Nicotine Dependence;Quality of Life;Report;Smokers;Smoking;Smoking Cessation;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Tobacco Smoking;Tobacco Use;Tobacco Use Disorder;Vaping",Nicotine Dependence;Substance Use Disorders;Tobacco Use Disorder,J Psychoactive Drugs,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
30656242,2019,Use of single IRBs for multi-site studies: A case report and commentary from a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network study.,"Recent NIH policy stipulates that multi-site studies must use a single or IRB (Institutional Review Board) in order to streamline the review process while maintaining standards for human subjects protection. The Western States Node of the Clinical Trials Network (CTN) used a single IRB for protocol CTN-0067, a clinical trial testing the use of an opioid antagonist (extended-release naltrexone) versus opioid agonists (buprenorphine or methadone) for opioid use disorders among individuals living with HIV. This case study discusses the processes and challenges associated with use of a single IRB. These lessons are also informed by other single IRB experiences within the CTN. The intention of the NIH single IRB policy is to facilitate efficient IRB processes. Advanced planning and transparent communication, however, are critical to avoid stalling IRB approval and protocol implementation. Research teams need to account for local IRB willingness to cede to a single IRB and understand the variations in interpretations of abbreviated reviews. In order to facilitate the effective use of single IRBs, recommendations include assigning staff at each study site for IRB submission coordination and interaction with the lead site IRB staff, training investigators and key regulatory staff on expectations for working with single IRBs, dedicating a regulatory specialist at the lead site to manage the process, developing a communication plan, and supporting the development of strong working relationships with local regulatory staff and the single IRB. The CTN experiences with single IRBs may provide insights for other investigators.","Buprenorphine;Case Reports;Case Study;Clinical Trial;Comment;Communication;Drug Abuse;Ethics Committees, Research;Expectations;HIV;Intention;Lead;Methadone;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Policy;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Subjects;Review;Specialists;Standards;Therapeutics",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder,Contemp Clin Trials Commun,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
30732542,2019,Barriers to Buprenorphine Expansion in Ohio: A Time-Elapsed Qualitative Study.,"Buprenorphine partial opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, a key treatment for opioid use disorders (OUDs), is underutilized in the United States. Qualitative interviews, conducted in 2012/2013 and repeated in 2015, identified systemic barriers to providing buprenorphine treatment in Ohio. A representative sample of Ohio's Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) county boards (n = 18) was selected based on percentage of OUD admissions, density of buprenorphine prescribers, and county board area population. Boards reported that the barriers to the use of buprenorphine in 2012/2013 included (1) negative attitudes toward the use of buprenorphine among substance use disorder treatment providers; (2) a lack of prescribers; and (3) lack of funding. The 2015 interviews suggested that the lack of prescribers surpassed lack of funding as the main impediment to buprenorphine expansion. Negative provider attitudes were no longer problematic. Concerns about buprenorphine diversion, however, had emerged as a new barrier. This article offers recommendations for future policy efforts to overcome these barriers and expand the use of evidence-based opioid treatments. It highlights the need for payers and policymakers to increase the number of buprenorphine prescribers to make best use of funding available to fight the opioid epidemic.","Alcohols;Attitude;Attitude of Health Personnel;Buprenorphine;Drug Abuse;Drug Therapy;Evidence-Based Practice;Future;Humans;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Mental Health Services;Needs;News;Ohio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Partial Opioid Agonists;Physicians;Policy;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Drug Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Psychoactive Drugs,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
30765118,2019,Comparing Canadian and United States opioid agonist therapy policies.,"Canada and the United States (U.S.) face an opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose epidemic. The most effective OUD treatment is opioid agonist therapy (OAT)-buprenorphine (with and without naloxone) and methadone. Although federal approval for OAT occurred decades ago, in both countries, access to and use of OAT is low. Restrictive policies and complex regulations contribute to limited OAT access. Through a non-systematic literature scan and a review of publicly available policy documents, we examined and compared OAT policies and practice at the federal (Canada vs. U.S.) and local levels (British Columbia [B.C.] vs. Oregon). Differences and similarities were noted between federal and local OAT policies, and subsequently OAT access. In Canada, OAT policy control has shifted from federal to provincial authorities. Conversely, in the U.S., federal authorities maintain primary control of OAT regulations. Local OAT health insurance coverage policies were substantively different between B.C. and Oregon. In B.C., five OAT options were available, while in Oregon, only two OAT options were available with administrative limitations. The differences in local OAT access and coverage policies between B.C. and Oregon, may be explained, in part, to the differences in Canadian and U.S. federal OAT policies, specifically, the relaxation of special federal OAT regulatory controls in Canada. The analysis also highlights the complicating contributions, and likely policy solutions, that exist within other drug policy sub-domains (e.g., the prescription regime, and drug control regime) and broader policy domains (e.g., constitutional rights). U.S. policymakers and health officials could consider adopting Canada's regulatory policy approach to expand OAT access to mitigate the harms of the ongoing opioid overdose epidemic.","Avena;British Columbia;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Canada;Classification;Drug Control;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Face;Health;Health Policy;Humans;Insurance Coverage;Insurance, Health;Literature;Methadone;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Prescriptions;Regulation;Relaxation;Review;Solutions;Therapeutics;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
30878769,2019,Predictors of timely opioid agonist treatment initiation among veterans with and without HIV.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is prevalent among people with HIV (PWH). Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is the most effective treatment for OUD and is associated with improved health outcomes, but is often not initiated. To inform clinical practice, we identified factors predictive of OAT initiation among patients with and without HIV. We identified 19,698 new clinical encounters of OUD between 2000 and 2012 in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS), a national observational cohort of PWH and matched uninfected controls. Mixed effects models examined factors predictive of OAT initiation within 30-days of a new OUD clinical encounter. 4.9% of both PWH and uninfected patients initiated OAT within 30 days of a new OUD clinical encounter. In adjusted models, participants with a psychiatric diagnosis (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.47 - 0.62), PWH (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.92), and rural residence (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.78) had a lower likelihood of any OAT initiation, while African-American patients (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.34-1.92), those with an alcohol related diagnosis (aOR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.48-2.08), diagnosis year 2005-2008 relative to 2000-2004 (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), and patients with HCV (aOR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.27-1.77) had a greater likelihood of initiating any OAT within 30 days. Predictive factors were similar in the total sample and PWH only models. PWH were less likely to receive timely OAT initiation than demographically similar uninfected patients. Given the health benefits of such treatment, the low rate of OAT initiation warrants focused efforts in both PWH and uninfected populations.","Adult;African Americans;Aging;Alcohols;Avena;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Diagnosis;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Female;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;Health Benefits;Hospitals;Humans;Male;Methadone;Middle Aged;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Population;Prevalence;Relatives;Therapeutics;Time-to-Treatment;United States;Veterans","Diagnosis, Psychiatric;HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders",Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
31193741,2018,Health-related internet use among opioid treatment patients.,"The Internet and smartphones have become commonplace and can be effective in overcoming traditional barriers to accessing health information about substance use disorders (SUD), and their prevention or treatment. Little is known, however, about specific factors that may influence the use of these technologies among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with SUDs. This study characterized the use of digital technologies and the Internet among individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder, focusing on identifying predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes. Participants came from an urban opioid replacement therapy program and completed a face-to-face survey on Internet and technology use. We examined the association between online health information seeking and technology acceptance variables, including perceived usefulness, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (e.g., availability of devices/services and technical support). Participants (N = 178, ages 18-64) endorsed high rates of current smartphone ownership (94%) and everyday Internet use (67%). 88% of participants reported searching online for information about health or medical topics in the past 3 months. Predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes were higher technology acceptance for mobile Internet use, younger age, current employment, and less bodily pain. Our results demonstrate high acceptance and use of mobile technology and the Internet among this sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with SUDs. However, these findings also highlight the importance of identifying barriers that disadvantaged groups face in using mobile technologies when designing technology-based interventions for this population.",Association;Devices;Digital Technology;Disadvantaged;Employment;Face;Health;Internet;Internet Use;Mobile Phone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Ownership;Pain;Patients;Population;Program;Smartphone;Substance Use Disorders;Surveys;Technology;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,Addict Behav Rep,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
31410816,2019,Inpatient Addiction Medicine Consultation and Post-Hospital Substance Use Disorder Treatment Engagement: a Propensity-Matched Analysis.,"Hospitalizations due to medical and surgical complications of substance use disorder (SUD) are rising. Most hospitals lack systems to treat SUD, and most people with SUD do not engage in treatment after discharge. Determine the effect of a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service, the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), on post-hospital SUD treatment engagement. Cohort study using multivariable analysis of Oregon Medicaid claims comparing IMPACT patients with propensity-matched controls. 18-64-year-old Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries with SUD, hospitalized at an Oregon hospital between July 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016. IMPACT patients (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 416) using a propensity score that accounted for SUD, gender, age, race, residence region, and diagnoses. IMPACT included hospital-based consultation care from an interdisciplinary team of addiction medicine physicians, social workers, and peers with lived experience in recovery. IMPACT met patients during hospitalization; offered pharmacotherapy, behavioral treatments, and harm reduction services; and supported linkages to SUD treatment after discharge. Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measure of SUD treatment engagement, defined as two or more claims on two separate days for SUD care within 34 days of discharge. Only 17.2% of all patients were engaged in SUD treatment before hospitalization. IMPACT patients engaged in SUD treatment following discharge more frequently than controls (38.9% vs. 23.3%, p &lt; 0.01; aOR 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-3.58). IMPACT participation remained associated with SUD treatment engagement when limiting the sample to people who were not engaged in treatment prior to hospitalization (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.46-4.72). Hospital-based addiction medicine consultation can improve SUD treatment engagement, which is associated with reduced substance use, mortality, and other important clinical outcomes.

31416475,2019,Medicaid expansion and treatment for opioid use disorders in Oregon: an interrupted time-series analysis.,"The study examined the association of the Affordable Care Act's 2014 Medicaid expansion on the use of psychosocial services and pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorders among Oregon Medicaid recipients. Logistic regression analysis examined utilization of care before (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2013) and after Medicaid expansion in Oregon (January 1, 2014-December 31, 2016). Adult membership in the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid) increased 180% following Medicaid expansion (2013 = 172,539; 2014 = 482,081) and the number with a diagnosis of OUD nearly doubled (2013 = 6808; 2014 = 13,418). More individuals received psychosocial services (2013 = 4714; 2014 = 8781) and medications (2013 = 3464; 2014 = 6093) for opioid use disorder. The percent of patients receiving psychosocial services (69% to 65%) and the percent of individuals receiving pharmacotherapy (57% to 45%) declined primarily because of a decline in the proportion receiving care in an opioid treatment program (2013 = 41%; 2014 = 33%). Odds of accessing any psychosocial service increased by 8% per year from 2010 to 2013 (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.11) with an 18% immediate decline associated with Medicaid expansion in 2014 (AOR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.76-0.87). Following Medicaid expansion, the odds of accessing psychosocial services increased 8% per year (2014 through 2016) (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.11). Use of medications for opioid use disorder found no change in the odds of use in the years prior to Medicaid expansion, an immediate 36% (AOR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.60-0.68) decline in 2014, and a 13% increase per year in 2015 and 2016 (AOR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.16). The number of Medicaid recipients with an opioid use disorder who received psychosocial and pharmacological services increased substantially following Oregon's Medicaid expansion in 2014. There was a decline, however, in the proportion of individuals with an opioid use disorder receiving care in opioid treatment programs.","Adolescent;Adult;Association;Diagnosis;Drug Therapy;Female;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Logistic Regression;Male;Medicaid;Middle Aged;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;Patients;Program;Social Work, Psychiatric;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
31687981,2020,Altered monocyte phenotype and dysregulated innate cytokine responses among people living with HIV and opioid-use disorder.,"Opioid-use disorders (OUD) and hepatitis C or B co-infection (HEP) are common among people living with HIV (PLHIV). The impact of OUD on innate and adaptive immunity among PLHIV with and without HEP is unknown. To investigate the impact of OUD on monocyte and T-cell phenotypes, cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and plasma inflammatory markers, among PLHIV with and without HEP. Cross-sectional study enrolling PLHIV receiving ART, with and without OUD. Flow cytometry determined monocyte and T-cell phenotypes; LPS and PHA-induced cytokine production was assessed following LPS and PHA stimulation by multiplex cytokine array; plasma IL-6, soluble CD163, and soluble CD14 were measured by ELISA. Twenty-two PLHIV with OUD and 37 PLHIV without OUD were included. PLHIV with OUD exhibited higher frequencies of intermediate (CD14CD16) and nonclassical (CD14CD16) monocytes when compared with PLHIV without OUD (P = 0.0025; P = 0.0001, respectively), regardless of HEP co-infection. Soluble CD163 and monocyte cell surface CD163 expression was increased among PLHIV with OUD and HEP, specifically. Regardless of HEP co-infection, PLHIV with OUD exhibited reduced production of IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha in response to LPS when compared with PLHIV without OUD; PHA-induced production of IL-10, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were also reduced among individuals with OUD. OUD among PLHIV are associated with altered monocyte phenotypes and a dysregulated innate cytokine response. Defining underlying mechanisms of opioid-associated innate immune dysregulation among PLHIV should be prioritized to identify optimal OUD treatment strategies.","Adaptive Immunity;Adult;Antigens, CD;Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic;Art;Biomarkers;Cells;Coinfection;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cytokines;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Female;Flow Cytometry;HIV;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Humans;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-1alpha;Interleukin-1beta;Interleukin-6;Interleukin-8;Lipopolysaccharides;Male;Middle Aged;Monocytes;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Phenotype;Phytohemagglutinins;Plasma;Production;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Receptors, Cell Surface;Soluble CD14 Protein;T-Lymphocytes;Therapeutics;Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Coinfection;HIV Infections;Hepatitis C;Necrosis;Neoplasms;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,AIDS,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
31703741,2019,Making the business case for an addiction medicine consult service: a qualitative analysis.,"As the drug poisoning crisis worsens in North America and opioid use disorder (OUD)-related hospital admissions increase, policymakers and hospital administrators are beginning to recognize the important role of hospitals in the OUD care continuum. This study explores and describes how U.S. addiction medicine physicians created and presented business propositions to hospital administrators to support the development of addiction medicine consult (AMC) services. Fifteen qualitative interviews were completed with board-certified or board-eligible addiction medicine physicians from 14 U.S. hospitals. The interviews occurred as part of a broader mixed methods study exploring hospital service delivery for patients admitted with OUD. Using a directed content analysis, the transcribed interviews were coded, analyzed, and final themes consolidated. Semi-structured interviews completed with addiction medicine physicians from established (n = 9) and developing (n = 5) AMC services at 14 U.S. hospitals explored how clinical champions persuaded hospital administrators to support AMC service development. Four elements were foundational to making the ""business case"": 1) describing the prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) or OUD in the hospital; 2) identifying the negative financial impacts of not treating SUDs during hospitalization; 3) highlighting the ongoing care quality and treatment gap for hospitalized patients with SUDs; and 4) noting the success of other institutional AMC services. Study findings informed the creation of tools to support AMC service development: 1) an AMC service business case template, and 2) an AMC service design and operations resource list. OUD-related hospital admissions are unlikely to abate. Hospital administrators should consider innovative care delivery mechanisms to improve care for persons with OUD. AMC services may be a promising delivery mechanism to achieve this aim. For clinical and administrative champions, understanding how to communicate the potential effectiveness of this intervention to hospital leaders is an essential first step to AMC service creation.","Abate;Addiction Medicine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Business;Comprehension;Consultation;Continuity of Patient Care;Elements;Female;Hospital Administrators;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Interview;Leadership;Male;Methadone;Methods;Middle Aged;Narcotic Antagonists;North America;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Poisoning;Prevalence;Quality of Health Care;Referral and Consultation;Resources;Role;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Poisoning;Substance Use Disorders,BMC Health Serv Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
31952629,2020,"""Now hospital leaders are paying attention"": A qualitative study of internal and external factors influencing addiction consult services.","Hospitalizations related to opioid use disorder (OUD) are increasing, necessitating an increase in the delivery of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) among hospitalized adults. The addiction consult service (ACS) is a promising organizational intervention to address this growing clinical need. Little is known about the barriers and facilitators of ACS development and operations. We completed 17 semi-structured telephone interviews with board-certified or board-eligible addiction physicians across 16 U.S. acute care hospitals. Interviews explored contextual facilitators and barriers for ACS development and operations. We transcribed, coded, analyzed interviews, and derived final themes using a directed content analysis. We identified six themes that promoted or inhibited ACS development and operations: 1) stigma and discrimination; 2) internal (e.g., hospital administrators) and external stakeholders (e.g., State Medicaid programs); 3) addiction-informed institutions with addiction-related resources; 4) access to community-based treatment programs (e.g., local opioid treatment programs); 5) restrictive and misinterpreted OAT policies; and 6) service financing. The first theme, stigma and discrimination, is presented as a stand-alone-theme but permeates the five other themes as a broader meta-theme. As OUD-related hospitalizations increase, and the opioid-related overdose crisis continues, understanding the constraints related to the development and operations of ACSs are important preliminary steps for improving the care of patients hospitalized with OUD. Clinical champions, hospital leaders, and hospital societies could act, through practice and policy initiatives, to support ACS development and increase the delivery of evidence-based services (e.g., OAT) to patients hospitalized with OUD.","Addiction Medicine;Address;Adult;Attention;Avena;Buprenorphine;Community;Comprehension;Hospital Administrators;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Interview;Interviews, Telephone;Medicaid;Methadone;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Physicians;Policy;Program;Resources;Societies, Hospital;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32228522,2020,HIV care continuum characteristics among people with opioid use disorder and HIV in Vietnam: baseline results from the BRAVO study.,"Little is known about patient characteristics that contribute to initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving viral suppression among HIV people with opioid use disorder in Vietnam. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and the critical steps in the HIV care continuum of ART initiation and HIV viral suppression among people with opioid use disorder and HIV in Vietnam. We assessed baseline participant characteristics, ART status, and HIV viral suppression (HIV RNA PCR &lt; 200 copies/mL) enrolled in a clinical trial of HIV clinic-based buprenorphine versus referral for methadone among people with opioid use disorder in Vietnam. We developed logistic regression models to identify characteristics associated with ART status and HIV viral suppression. Among 283 study participants, 191 (67.5%) were prescribed ART at baseline, and 168 of those on ART (90%) were virally suppressed. Years since HIV diagnosis (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.06, 1.19) and being married (aOR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.51, 5.34) were associated with an increased likelihood of current prescription for ART at baseline. Greater depression symptoms were negatively associated with receipt of ART (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = (0.94, 0.9963)). In the HIV suppression model, once adjusting for all included covariates, only receipt of ART was associated with viral suppression (aOR = 25.9, 95% CI = (12.5, 53.8). In bivariate analyses, methamphetamine was negatively correlated with ART prescription (p = 0.07) and viral suppression (p = 0.08). While fewer than 90% of participants had received ART, 90% of those on ART had achieved HIV viral suppression at baseline, suggesting that interventions to improve uptake of ART in Vietnam are essential for achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals in people who use heroin in Vietnam. Social determinants of health associated with ART and HIV viral suppression suggest that social support may be a key to facilitating both of these steps in the HIV care continuum.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Retroviral Agents;Art;Art Therapy;Association;Buprenorphine;Clinical Trial;Continuity of Patient Care;Depression;Diagnosis;Female;Goals;HIV;HIV Infections;Heroin;Humans;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Male;Methadone;Methamphetamine;Middle Aged;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Persons;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Prescriptions;RNA;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Referral;Social Determinants of Health;Social Support;Vietnam;Viral Load",HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,BMC Public Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32651887,2020,Reducing overdose after release from incarceration (ROAR): study protocol for an intervention to reduce risk of fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose among women after release from prison.,"Drug overdose is the leading cause of death after release from prison, and this risk is significantly higher among women compared to men. Within the first 2 weeks after release, the risk of death from drug overdose is 12.7 times higher than the general population, with risk of death further elevated among females. Although female inmates have higher rates of opioid use disorder and post-release overdose fatality, justice-involved women are under-represented in studies of medications for opioid use disorder. The Reducing Overdose After Release from Incarceration (ROAR) pilot intervention and evaluation (recruitment June 2019 through December 2020) aims to reduce opioid overdose among women released to the community following incarceration in state prison. The evaluation further assesses induction, acceptance and effectiveness of extended release naltrexone in a female post-prison population. In the week prior to their release, female adults in custody with moderate to severe opioid use disorder start treatment with extended release naltrexone, an injectable opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids for up to 1 month. All ROAR participants receive training to use naloxone rescue kits and are provided nasal naloxone at release. Ongoing support from a certified recovery mentor to facilitate sustained engagement with treatment for substance use disorders begins in the month prior to release from prison and continues for 6 months in community. We evaluate the association between ROAR participation and the primary outcome of opioid overdose. Using administrative data provided by the Oregon Department of Corrections and the Oregon Health Authority, we compare the odds of overdose among ROAR participants versus a comparison group of females released from prison during the study period. Evaluation activities in community includes survey and qualitative interviews for 6 months post release, as well as a review of clinic records to assess retention on medication among the pilot cohort (N = 100). ROAR is a collaboration between Oregon's public health, criminal justice, and medical communities. The ROAR intervention and evaluation provide critical information on improving interventions to prevent opioid overdose and improve retention on treatment in community in an overlooked, high-risk population: incarcerated women re-entering the community.

32801112,2020,Impact of 12 step mutual help groups on drug use disorder patients across six clinical trials.,"12 step mutual help groups are widely accessed by people with drug use disorder but infrequently subjected to rigorous evaluation. Pooling randomized trials containing a condition in which mutual help group attendance is actively facilitated presents an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of 12 step groups in large, diverse samples of drug use disorder patients. Data from six federally-funded randomized trials were pooled (n = 1730) and subjected to two-stage instrumental variables modelling, and, fixed and random effects regression models. All trials included a 12 step group facilitation condition and employed the Addiction Severity Index as a core measure. The ability of 12 step facilitation to increase mutual help group participation among drug use disorder patients was minimal, limiting ability to employ two-stage instrumental variable models that correct for selection bias. However, traditional fixed and random effect regression models found that greater 12 step mutual help group attendance by drug use disorder patients predicted reduced use of and problems with illicit drugs and also with alcohol. Facilitating significant and lasting involvement in 12 step groups may be more challenging for drug use disorder patients than for alcohol use disorder patients, which has important implications for clinical work and for effectiveness evaluations. Though selection bias could explain part of the results of traditional regression models, the finding that participation in 12 step mutual help groups predicts lower illicit drug and alcohol use and problems in a large, diverse, sample of drug use disorder patients is encouraging.",Ability;Adult;Alcohol Drinking;Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Clinical Trial;Clinical Trials as Topic;Drug Use Disorders;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Index;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Selection Bias;Self;Self-Help Groups;Substance-Related Disorders;Work,Alcohol Use Disorder;Alcoholism;Drug Use Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32861136,2020,A systematic review and meta-analysis of medications for stimulant use disorders in patients with co-occurring opioid use disorders.,"Stimulant (cocaine and/or methamphetamine) use has increased among people with opioid use disorder. We conducted a systematic review of medications for stimulant use disorders in this population. We searched for randomized controlled trials in multiple databases through April 2019, and dual-screened studies using pre-specified inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes were abstinence defined as stimulant-negative urine screens for ≥3 consecutive weeks; overall use as the proportion of stimulant-negative urine specimens; and retention as the proportion of participants who completed treatment. We rated strength of evidence using established criteria and conducted meta-analyses of comparable interventions and outcomes. Thirty-four trials of 22 medications focused on cocaine use disorder in patients with opioid use disorder. Most studies enrolled participants stabilized on opioid maintenence therapy, generally methadone. None of the six studies that assessed abstinence found significant differences between groups. We found moderate-strength evidence that antidepressants (desipramine, bupropion, and fluoxetine) worsened retention. There was moderate-strength evidence that disulfiram worsened treatment retention (N = 605, RR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.77 to 0.95). We found low-strength evidence that psychostimulants (mazindol and dexamphetamine) may reduce cocaine use, though the difference was not statistically significant (standard mean difference 0.35 [95 % CI -0.05 to 0.74]). There was only 1 trial for methamphetamine use disorder, which showed insufficient-strength evidence for naltrexone. Co-occurring stimulant/opioid use disorder is an important problem for targeting future research. Medication trials for methamphetamine use disorder are lacking in this population. Most of the medications studied for cocaine use were ineffective, although psychostimulants warrant further study.","Amphetamine;Analgesics, Opioid;Antidepressive Agents;Bupropion;Central Nervous System Stimulants;Cocaine;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Database;Desipramine;Dextroamphetamine;Disulfiram;Drug Therapy;Female;Fluoxetine;Future;Humans;Mazindol;Meta-Analysis;Methadone;Methamphetamine;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Patients;Persons;Population;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Standards;Substance Use Disorders;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Urine",Cocaine-Related Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32935311,2020,Prescription Opioid Dispensing Patterns Prior to Heroin Overdose in a State Medicaid Program: a Case-Control Study.,"A large proportion of individuals who use heroin report initiating opioid use with prescription opioids. However, patterns of prescription opioid use preceding heroin-related overdose have not been described. To describe prescription opioid use in the year preceding heroin overdose. Case-control study comparing prescription opioid use with a heroin-involved overdose, non-heroin-involved opioid overdose, and non-overdose controls from 2015 to 2017. Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries with linked administrative claims, vital statistics, and prescription drug monitoring program data. Opioid, benzodiazepine, and other central nervous system depressant prescriptions preceding overdose; among individuals with one or more opioid prescription, we assessed morphine milligram equivalents per day, overlapping prescriptions, prescriptions from multiple prescribers, long-term use, and discontinuation of long-term use. We identified 1458 heroin-involved overdoses (191 fatal) and 2050 non-heroin-involved opioid overdoses (266 fatal). In the 365 days prior to their overdose, 45% of individuals with a heroin-involved overdose received at least one prescribed opioid compared with 78% of individuals who experienced a non-heroin-involved opioid overdose (p &lt; 0.001). For both heroin- and non-heroin-involved overdose cases, the likelihood of receiving an opioid increased with age. Among heroin overdose cases with an opioid dispensed, the rate of multiple pharmacy use was the only high-risk opioid pattern that was greater than non-overdose controls (adjusted odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 6.95). Discontinuation of long-term opioid use was not common prior to heroin overdose and not higher than discontinuation rates among non-overdose controls. Although individuals with a heroin-involved overdose were less likely to receive prescribed opioids in the year preceding their overdose relative to non-heroin opioid overdose cases, prescription opioid use was relatively common and increased with age. Discontinuation of long-term prescription opioid use was not associated with heroin-involved overdose.","Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Case-Control Studies;Central Nervous System Depressants;Confidence Intervals;Drug Overdose;Heroin;Humans;Medicaid;Morphine;Odds Ratio;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Oregon;Pharmacy;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Program;Relatives;Report;Risk;United States;Vital Statistics",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32940824,2021,Provider Perspectives on Integration of Substance Use Disorder and HIV Care in Vietnam: A Qualitative Study.,"UNAIDS recommends integration of medications for substance use disorders (SUD) with HIV care to improve HIV outcomes. Yet, integration of HIV and SUD services remains limited in many countries. The objective of this study was to assess provider perceptions of care integration in Vietnam. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 43 providers (nurses, physicians, counselors, pharmacists, and clinic managers) in 8 HIV clinics in northern Vietnam, 2013-2015. Providers identified five themes informing HIV and SUD treatment integration: (1) treatment for alcohol use disorder is often neglected compared to other SUD treatment; (2) structural challenges must be addressed to increase integration feasibility; (3) workforce limitations; (4) societal and healthcare stigmatization of SUD; and (5) providers' conflicting views regarding integration challenges. The experience of providers in Vietnam may be useful to other countries attempting to integrate HIV and SUD services.","Adult;Alcohol Use Disorder;Attitude of Health Personnel;Counselors;Delivery of Health Care, Integrated;Female;HIV;HIV Infections;Health Care;Humans;Interview;Interviews as Topic;Male;Middle Aged;Nurses;Opioid Use Disorder;Perception;Pharmacists;Physicians;Primary Health Care;Qualitative Research;Stigmatization;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Vietnam;Workforce",Alcohol Use Disorder;HIV Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Behav Health Serv Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
32945874,2020,"Assessment of Opioid Prescribing Patterns in a Large Network of US Community Health Centers, 2009 to 2018.","Understanding opioid prescribing patterns in community health centers (CHCs) that disproportionately serve low-income patients may help to guide strategies to reduce opioid-related harms. To assess opioid prescribing patterns between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, in a network of safety-net clinics serving high-risk patients. Cross-sectional study of 3 227 459 opioid prescriptions abstracted from the electronic health records of 2 129 097 unique primary care patients treated from 2009 through 2018 at a network of CHCs that included 449 clinic sites in 17 states. All age groups were included in the analysis. The following measures were described at the population level for each study year: (1) percentage of patients with at least 1 prescription for an opioid by age and sex, (2) number of opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (3) number of long-acting opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (4) mean annual morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per patient, (5) mean MME per prescription, (6) number of chronic opioid users, and (7) mean of high-dose opioid users. The study population included 2 129 097 patients (1 158 413 women [54.4%]) with a mean (SD) age of 32.2 (21.1) years and a total of 3 227 459 opioid prescriptions. The percentage of patients receiving at least 1 opioid prescription in a calendar year declined 67.4% from 15.9% in 2009 to 5.2% in 2018. Over the 10-year study period, a greater percentage of women received a prescription (13.1%) compared with men (10.9%), and a greater percentage of non-Hispanic White patients (18.1%) received an opioid prescription compared with non-Hispanic Black patients (9.5%), non-Hispanic patients who self-identified as other races (8.0%), and Hispanic patients (6.9%). The number of opioid prescriptions for every 100 patients decreased 73.7% from 110.8 in 2009 to 29.1 in 2018. The number of long-acting opioids for every 100 patients decreased 85.5% during the same period, from 22.0 to 3.2. The MMEs per patient decreased from 1682.7 in 2009 to 243.1 in 2018, a decline of 85.6%. In this cross-sectional study, the opioid prescribing rate in 2009 in the CHC network was higher than national population estimates but began to decline earlier and more precipitously. This finding likely reflects harm mitigation policies and efforts at federal, state, and clinic levels and strong clinical quality improvement strategies within the CHCs.","Adult;Age Groups;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Calendar;Community Health Centers;Community Networks;Comprehension;Cross-Sectional Studies;Delayed-Action Preparations;Electronic Health Records;Ethnic Groups;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Income;Male;Measures;Medication Therapy Management;Men;Morphine;Opioids;Patients;Policy;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Primary Health Care;Quality Improvement;Racial Stocks;Risk;Safety-net Clinics;Self;Sex;Sex Factors;United States;Whites;Women",,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
33166363,2020,"Population-based trends in hospitalizations due to injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections, Oregon, 2008 to 2018.","Injection drug use has far-reaching social, economic, and health consequences. Serious bacterial infections, including skin/soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis, are particularly morbid and mortal consequences of injection drug use. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort analysis of hospitalizations among patients with a diagnosis code for substance use and a serious bacterial infection during the same hospital admission using Oregon Hospital Discharge Data. We examined trends in hospitalizations and costs of hospitalizations attributable to injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2018. From 2008 to 2018, Oregon hospital discharge data included 4,084,743 hospitalizations among 2,090,359 patients. During the study period, hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection increased from 980 to 6,265 per year, or from 0.26% to 1.68% of all hospitalizations (P&lt;0.001). The number of unique patients with an injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection increased from 839 to 5,055, or from 2.52% to 8.46% of all patients (P&lt;0.001). While hospitalizations for all injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased over the study period, bacteremia/sepsis hospitalizations rose most rapidly with an 18-fold increase. Opioid use diagnoses accounted for the largest percentage of hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections, but hospitalizations for amphetamine-type stimulant-related serious bacterial infections rose most rapidly with a 15-fold increase. People living with HIV and HCV experienced increases in hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infection during the study period. Overall, the total cost of hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased from $16,305,129 in 2008 to $150,879,237 in 2018 (P&lt;0.001). In Oregon, hospitalizations for injection drug use-related serious bacterial infections increased dramatically and exacted a substantial cost on the health care system from 2008 to 2018. This increase in hospitalizations represents an opportunity to initiate substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction services to improve outcomes for people who inject drugs.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Amphetamine;Analysis, Cohort;Bacteremia;Bacterial Infections;Child;Child, Preschool;Cost;Diagnosis;Economics;Endocarditis;Female;HIV;Harm Reduction;Health;Health Care Costs;Health Care Systems;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Injections;Male;Middle Aged;North Carolina;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Osteomyelitis;Overall;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Retrospective Studies;Rosa;Sepsis;Skin;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult","Bacteremia;Bacterial Infections;Endocarditis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Osteomyelitis;Sepsis;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders",PLoS One,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
33577229,2022,Trust in Hospital Physicians Among Patients With Substance Use Disorder Referred to an Addiction Consult Service: A Mixed-methods Study.,"Trust is essential in patient-physician relationships. Hospitalized patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often experience stigma and trauma in the hospital, which can impede trust. Little research has explored the role of hospital-based addictions care in creating trusting relationships with patients with SUDs. This study describes how trust in physicians changed among hospitalized people with SUDs who were seen by an interprofessional addiction medicine service. We analyzed data from hospitalized patients with SUD seen by an addiction consult service from 2015 to 2018. Participants completed surveys at baseline and 30 to 90 days after hospital discharge. Follow-up assessments included open-ended questions exploring participant experiences with hospitalization and the addiction consult service. We measured provider trust using the Wake Forest Trust scale. We modeled trust trajectories using discrete mixture modeling, and sampled qualitative interviews from those trust trajectories. Of 328 participants with SUD who had prior hospitalizations but had not previously been seen by an addiction consult service, 196 (59.8%) had both baseline and follow-up trust scores. We identified 3 groups of patients: Persistent-Low Trust, Increasing Trust, and Persistent-High Trust and 4 qualitative themes around in-hospital trust: humanizing care, demonstrating addiction expertise, reliability, and granting agency. Most participants retained or increased to high trust levels after hospitalization with an addiction consult service. Addiction consult services can create environments where healthcare providers build trust with, and humanize care for, hospitalized patients with SUD, and can also mitigate power struggles that hospitalized patients with SUD frequently experience.","Addiction Medicine;Environment;Forests;Health Personnel;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Interview;Methods;Patients;Persons;Physicians;Power, Psychological;Reproducibility of Results;Research;Role;Scales;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Trust;Wounds and Injuries",Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
33635926,2021,Understanding the impact of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic on hospitalized patients with substance use disorder.,"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic rapidly shifted dynamics around hospitalization for many communities. This study aimed to evaluate how the pandemic altered the experience of healthcare, acute illness, and care transitions among hospitalized patients with substance use disorder (SUD). We performed a qualitative study at an academic medical center in Portland, Oregon, in Spring 2020. We conducted semi-structured interviews, and conducted a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach, at a semantic level. We enrolled 27 participants, and identified four main themes: 1) shuttered community resources threatened patients' basic survival adaptations; 2) changes in outpatient care increased reliance on hospitals as safety nets; 3) hospital policy changes made staying in the hospital harder than usual; and, 4) care transitions out of the hospital were highly uncertain.

33863865,2022,Patient outcomes after opioid dose reduction among patients with chronic opioid therapy.,"The net effects of prescribing initiatives that encourage dose reductions are uncertain. We examined whether rapid dose reduction after high-dose chronic opioid therapy (COT) associates with suicide, overdose, or other opioid-related adverse events. This retrospective cohort study included Oregon Medicaid recipients with high-dose COT. Claims were linked with prescription data from the prescription drug monitoring program and death data from vital statistics, 2014 to 2017. Participants were placed into 4 mutually exclusive dose trajectory groups after the high-dose COT period, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the effect of dose changes on patient outcomes in the following year. Of the 14,596 high-dose COT patients, 4191 (28.7%) abruptly discontinued opioid prescriptions, 1648 (11.3%) reduced opioid dose before discontinuing, 6480 (44.4%) had a dose reduction but never discontinued, and 2277 (15.6%) had a stable or increasing dose. Discontinuation, whether abrupt (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-9.25) or with dose reduction (aHR 4.47, 95% CI 1.68-11.88) significantly increased risk of suicide compared with those with stable or increasing dose. By contrast, discontinuation or dose reduction reduced the risk of overdose compared with those with a stable or increasing dose (aHR 0.36-0.62, 95% CI 0.20-0.94). Patients with an abrupt discontinuation were more likely to overdose on heroin (vs. prescription opioids) than patients in other groups (P &lt; 0.0001). Our study suggests that patients on COT require careful risk assessment and supportive interventions when considering opioid discontinuation or continuation at a high dose.","Analgesics, Opioid;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Cox Proportional Hazards Models;Death;Drug Overdose;Drug Tapering;Heroin;Humans;Medicaid;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Patients;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Assessment;Suicide;Therapeutics;United States;Vital Statistics",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Pain,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34001775,2022,Low-dose Buprenorphine Initiation in Hospitalized Adults With Opioid Use Disorder: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.,"Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) can initiate buprenorphine without requiring a withdrawal period through a low-dose (sometimes referred to as ""micro-induction"") approach. Although there is growing interest in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, current evidence is limited to case reports and small case series. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD seen by a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service who underwent low-dose buprenorphine initiation starting during hospital admission. We then integrated our practice-based experiences with results from the existing literature to create practice considerations. Sixty-eight individuals underwent 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations between July 2019 and July 2020. Reasons for low-dose versus standard buprenorphine initiation included co-occurring pain (91.7%), patient anxiety around the possibility of withdrawal (69.4%), history of precipitated withdrawal (9.7%), opioid withdrawal intolerance (6.9%), and other reason/not specified (18.1%). Of the 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations, 50 (69.4%) were completed in the hospital, 9 (12.5%) transitioned to complete as an outpatient, and 13 (18.1%) were terminated early. We apply our experiences and findings from literature to recommendations for varied clinical scenarios, including acute illness, co-occurring pain, opioid withdrawal intolerance, transition from high dose methadone to buprenorphine, history of precipitated withdrawal, and rapid hospital discharge. We share a standard low-dose initiation protocol with potential modifications based on above scenarios. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation offers a well-tolerated and versatile approach for hospitalized patients with OUD. We share lessons from our experiences and the literature, and provide practical considerations for providers.","Addiction Medicine;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Analysis, Cohort;Anxiety;Buprenorphine;Case Reports;Cohort Studies;History;Hospitals;Humans;Literature;Methadone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain;Patients;Retrospective Studies;Standards",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34051546,2021,Interim methadone - Effective but underutilized: A scoping review.,"Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) may provide interim methadone services - up to 120 days of methadone dosing without counseling. Regulatory requirements limit use of interim methadone services. We summarized the evidence on interim methadone and other strategies to minimize wait lists in OTPs. A scoping review selected studies of interim methadone and strategies that facilitated access to methadone. Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized; if evidence was lacking, lesser quality evidence was included. Six studies examined interim methadone and three studies examined alternatives: low threshold services, an open access policy, and a medication first policy. The studies included four randomized clinical trials of interim methadone (with three follow-up reports and five secondary analyses), one prospective cohort of interim methadone, one retrospective cohort of interim methadone, one randomized trial of low threshold services and two pre-post assessments of changes in program or state policies. The clinical trials and observational cohorts reported reductions in heroin use during interim methadone and participants were more likely to enter OTPs than those on wait lists. Retention rates in interim methadone were similar to patients in active treatment. Studies testing strategies to facilitate access to methadone were effective without interim methadone's restrictions. Interim methadone appears to be effective and safe compared to wait list controls and provided similar outcomes to standard services. Interim methadone could increase access to OTPs. More research is needed on the alternative approaches to facilitate access to medication with comparisons to wait list controls and assessment of patient outcomes.","Access To Medicines;Analgesics, Opioid;Clinical Trial;Counseling;Heroin;Humans;Methadone;Observational Study;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Policy;Program;Prospective Studies;Report;Research;Retrospective Studies;Review;Standards;Therapeutics;Waiting Lists",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34078194,2021,Experimental (Re)structuring: The Clinical Trial as Turning Point Among Medical Research Participants.,"Amid the growth of addiction medicine randomized controlled trials (RCTs), scholars have begun examining participants' study experiences, highlighting facilitators and barriers to enrollment. However, this work can overlook the interplay between trial participation and social-structural dimensions among people with substance use disorders linked to the social nature of use, socioeconomic marginalization, and time demands of substance procurement and use. To effectively conduct RCTs with this unique population, it is necessary to examine the broader social context of study participation. We conducted nested qualitative interviews with 22 participants involved in an RCT testing a treatment for alcohol and opioid use disorders in HIV clinics. Thematic analyses revealed social-structural circumstances shaping RCT participation as well as how participation constitutes a turning point, prompting individuals to reconfigure social networks, reorient to spatial environments, and reorganize day-to-day life-with implications for how substance use disorder RCTs should be approached by researchers.",Addiction Medicine;Alcohols;Biomedical Research;Canada;Clinical Trial;Environment;Growth;HIV;Humans;Interview;Life;Medical Research;Nature;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Population;Qualitative Research;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research Personnel;Social Environment;Social Networks;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;Vulnerable Populations;Work,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Qual Health Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34080541,2021,"Mobile methadone medication units: A brief history, scoping review and research opportunity.","The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved the first mobile medication unit (i.e., a van to administer methadone) in 1988 and approved units on an ad hoc basis until issuing a moratorium in 2007 citing concerns about safety and diversion. In February 2020, the DEA released a notice of proposed rulemaking to permit a resumption of mobile medication units. The Biden Administration plans to release the final rule in 2021. Because a preliminary scan suggested limited evidence, a scoping review examined the research related to methadone vans to identify and assess the extent of mobile methadone research and inform the development and implementation of new mobile services. A scoping review, supplemented with key informant interviews, identified and described the most relevant evidence. Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched from inception to July 2020. Informant interviews provided perspective on the need for and the use of mobile medication units, the history of methadone vans, and benefits and problems associated with the units. The scoping review found limited evidence: three cohort analyses (one prospective) and one before and after analysis (four studies) of individuals using mobile medication services. Mobile services were associated with enhanced retention in care (relative to patients in fixed site programs) and mobile units appeared to facilitate access for underserved populations with opioid use disorders. The key informants addressed the history of methadone vans, the potential use to serve rural communities and correctional facilities and the benefits and problems associated with mobile services. The scoping review found evidence that mobile services increase methadone access among underserved populations and may enhance retention in care. The DEA's proposed regulatory modification creates opportunities to further evaluate the implementation and the effects of mobile medication units.","Administration;Analysis, Cohort;Bidens;Correctional Facilities;Database;History;Humans;Interview;MEDLINE;Methadone;Needs;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Permits;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Populations, Underserved;Program;Prospective Studies;Relatives;Research;Retention in Care;Review;Rural Communities;Safety;Systematic Review;Systematic Reviews as Topic",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34117637,2021,'This could be my last chance': Therapeutic optimism in a randomised controlled trial for substance use disorders.,"In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 'therapeutic optimism' describes a participant's belief they will benefit from the study treatment, despite the express goal of RCTs to test unknown aspects of interventions. Harbouring such expectations may interfere with RCT participation experiences, particularly among marginalised populations, such as people with substance use disorders (PSUD) who may experience social and structural barriers to participation that also increase their vulnerability to therapeutic optimism. However, little research explores therapeutic optimism within substance use trials. Thus, we conducted a nested qualitative study within an RCT testing a treatment for alcohol and opioid use disorders in HIV clinics. Using interviews with 22 participants in Vancouver, Canada, analysis revealed themes relevant to therapeutic optimism, that were specifically linked to intrinsic (e.g. health-related) or extrinsic motivations (e.g. stipend). First, compared to extrinsically motivated participants, intrinsically motivated participants held high expectations for the trial and attributed greater agency to the study medication. Second, intrinsically motivated participants expressing therapeutic optimism anticipated marked changes in their lives from the study/medication. Finally, some participants predicted the treatment would solve substance-related issues in their communities. These findings highlight the interplay between therapeutic optimism and complex interpretations of RCT objectives among PSUD.",Alcohols;Beliefs;Canada;Community;Expectations;Goals;HIV;Health;Humans;Interview;Medical Research;Motivation;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Optimism;Persons;Population;Qualitative Research;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Sociol Health Illn,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34134860,2021,"""Sobriety equals getting rid of hepatitis C"": A qualitative study exploring the interplay of substance use disorder and hepatitis C among hospitalized adults.","People who use drugs (PWUD) commonly experience complex illness, psychosocial stressors, housing insecurity, and stigma, which may play key roles in their struggles with addiction. In a study of hospitalized PWUD with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), participants described treating HCV as ""part of recovery."" These findings led us to explore how hospitalization and acute illness altered patients' perceptions of substance use disorder (SUD) and HCV. Researchers audio recorded in-depth semi-structured individual interviews of 27 hospitalized adults with SUD and HCV seen by an addiction consult service (ACS) at an urban academic medical center between June and November 2019. Research staff transcribed interviews and dual coded them deductively and inductively at the semantic level. Researchers used a matrix visualization to discern relationships among codes and conducted a thematic analysis. Many participants believed addictions treatment should precede an HCV cure for varying reasons. Some wanted to avoid reinfection; others believed ""getting clean"" afforded the mental clarity to address health issues, including HCV. Patients newly engaged in SUD treatment described HCV treatment as a ""step towards recovery"" and could serve as motivation to continue SUD treatment. Participants believed HCV cure could facilitate sobriety by ""mentally putting drugs in the past"" and was a future-oriented action toward ""better health."" Many participants described the compounded stigma of having HCV infection and SUD by multiple groups, including friends/family who do not use drugs, other drug users, and health care workers. Hospitalized adults with SUD and HCV believed addictions engagement should precede HCV treatment and HCV cure could play an important role in their ""recovery"" journey.

34161198,2022,Exploring how hospitalization can alter hepatitis c virus treatment prioritization and trajectories in people who use drugs: A qualitative analysis.,"Background: People who use drugs (PWUD) have high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Hospitalization can be a time for PWUD to engage in addiction treatment, but little is known about how hospitalization shapes HCV treatment readiness. We aimed to describe how hospitalization and addiction medicine consult service (AMCS) can alter HCV prioritization of inpatient PWUD with HCV. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews (n = 27) of hospitalized adults with addiction and HCV infection seen by an AMCS at a single, urban, academic center. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded iteratively at the semantic level, and analyzed for themes. Results: Of the 27 participants, most identified as Caucasian (85%), male gender (67%), and they primarily used opioids (78%); approximately half (48%) reported HCV diagnosis over 5 years ago. We identified three main themes around hospitalization altering the prioritizations and HCV treatment preferences for PWUD: (1) HCV treatment non-engaged (2) HCV treatment urgency, and (3) HCV treatment in the future. Those wanting to treat HCV-whether urgently or in the future-shared the overlapping theme of hospitalization as a reachable moment for their addiction and HCV. These participants recognized the long-term benefits of addressing HCV and connected their hospitalization to substance use. Conclusion: In our study, PWUD with HCV expressed varying and competing priorities and life circumstances contributing to three main HCV treatment trajectories. Our results suggest ways hospitalization can serve as an HCV touchpoint for PWUD, especially in the context of addressing substance use, and could be used when designing and implementing targeted interventions to improve the HCV care continuum for PWUD.","Addiction Medicine;Adult;Continuity of Patient Care;Diagnosis;Future;Gender;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Hospitalization;Humans;Infections;Inpatients;Interview;Life;Male;Methods;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Qualitative Research;Semantics;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time","Hepatitis C;Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders",Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34282085,2022,Effectiveness of and Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder for Adolescents and Young Adults: A Scoping Review.,"A scoping review assessed access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and treatment outcomes among adolescents (12 - 17 years) and young adults (18 - 25 years). Studies addressing adolescent and young adult opioid use disorder and treatment with MOUD on patient outcomes (eg, retention in care) were included. Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized. Investigators extracted key information, summarized findings, noted methodological weaknesses, and tabled the details. The search identified 4 randomized trials (N = 241), 1 systematic review with 52 studies (total N = 125,994), and 5 retrospective analyses of health insurance claims. The trials reported buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone reduced opioid use. Return to use was observed when pharmacotherapy ceased. A systematic review concluded that adolescents and young adults had lower retention in care than older adults. The observational studies found that adolescents were unlikely to receive MOUD. There was some evidence that non-Hispanic Black adolescents and young adults were less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive MOUD. MOUD therapies reduce opioid use among adolescent and young adults but few receive MOUD. MOUD services for adolescents and young adults should be developed and tested. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to develop appropriate clinical guidelines for using MOUD with adolescents and young adults.","Access To Medicines;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Blacks;Buprenorphine;Clinical Practice Guideline;Clinical Trial;Drug Therapy;Health Services Accessibility;Hispanics;Humans;Insurance, Health;Naltrexone;Observational Study;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Research Personnel;Retention in Care;Retrospective Studies;Review;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Whites;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched, and reference lists were reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies were eligible if they focused on methadone treatment in office-based settings conducted in the United States or other highly developed countries and reported outcomes (e.g., retention in care). Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized; uncontrolled and descriptive studies were included when stronger evidence was unavailable. One investigator abstracted key information, and a second verified data. A scoping review approach broadly surveyed the evidence, and therefore study quality was not rated formally. Eighteen studies of patients treated with office-based methadone were identified, including six trials, eight observational studies, and four additional articles discussing use of pharmacies to dispense methadone. Studies on office-based methadone treatment, including primary care-based dispensing, were limited but consistently found that stable methadone patients valued office-based care and remained in care with low rates of drug use; outcomes were similar compared with stable patients in regular care. Office-based methadone treatment was associated with higher treatment satisfaction and quality of life. Limitations included underpowered comparisons and small samples. Limited research suggests that office-based methadone treatment and pharmacy dispensing could enhance access to methadone treatment for patients with opioid use disorder without adversely affecting patient outcomes and, potentially, inform modifications to federal regulations.

34510087,2022,Causes of Death in the 12 Months After Hospital Discharge Among Patients With Opioid Use Disorder.,"Patients with substance use disorders are seven times more likely hospitalized than the general population. However, causes of death for recently hospitalized patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are not well described. This study describes causes of death in the year post-discharge among hospitalized patients with OUD. We analyzed data from participants who were at least 18 years old, with Medicaid insurance, and had a diagnosis of OUD during a general hospital admission in Oregon between April 2015 and December 2017. During the study window, 6,654 Oregon Medicaid patients with an OUD diagnosis were hospitalized. Patients were predominately female (56.7%) and White (72.2%), an average age of 44.2 years (SD = 15.4 years) and average hospital length of stay of 6.5 days (SD = 10.9 days). In the 12 months post-discharge, 522 patients died (7.8%); 301 patients from a drug or substance related cause (4.5%), including 71 from drug overdose (1.1%). Stated another way, of those who died within 12 months, 58% of deaths were attributed to drug-related causes, including 13.6% of deaths attributed to overdose; 42% died of non-drug related causes. Drug-related death was the most frequent cause of mortality. Hospitalized patients with OUD are at high risk of death, from drug and non-drug related causes, in the year after discharge. Future research should consider not only overdose, but a more comprehensive definition of drug-related death in understanding post-discharge mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD, and care systems should work to mitigate the risk of death in this population.","Adolescent;Adult;Aftercare;Analgesics, Opioid;Cause of Death;Comprehension;Death;Diagnosis;Drug Overdose;Female;Future;Hospitals;Hospitals, General;Humans;Insurance;Length of Stay;Medicaid;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Oregon;Patient Discharge;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Research;Risk;Substance Use Disorders;Time;United States;Whites;Work",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34520702,2022,"Opioid treatment programs, telemedicine and COVID-19: A scoping review.","Background: Methadone and buprenorphine are effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that are highly regulated in the United States. The on-going opioid crisis, and more recently COVID-19, has prompted reconsideration of these restrictions in order to sustain and improve treatment access, with renewed interest in telemedicine. We reviewed the evidence on use of telemedicine interventions and applicability to MOUD policy changes in the post-COVID-19 treatment landscape. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched from inception to April 2021 and reference lists were reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies were eligible if they examined telemedicine interventions and reported outcomes (e.g. treatment initiation, retention in care). Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized; other studies were included when stronger evidence was unavailable. One investigator abstracted key information and a second investigator verified data. We described the results qualitatively. Results: We identified nine studies: three controlled trials (two randomized), and six observational studies. Three studies evaluated patients treated with methadone and six studies with buprenorphine, including one study of pregnant women with OUD. All studies showed telemedicine approaches associated with similar outcomes (treatment retention, positive urine toxicology) compared to treatment as usual. Trials were limited by small samples sizes, lack of reporting harms, and most were conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; observational studies were limited by failure to control for confounding. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that telemedicine may enhance access to MOUD with similar effectiveness compared with face-to-face treatment. Few studies have been published since COVID-19, and it is unclear the potential impact of these interventions on the existing racial/ethnic disparities in treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic and need for social distancing led to temporary policy changes for prescribing of MOUD that could inform additional research in this area to support comprehensive policy reforms.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Database;Face;Female;Humans;MEDLINE;Methadone;Methods;Needs;Observational Study;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Distancing;Policy;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications, Infectious;Pregnant Women;Program;Research;Research Personnel;Retention in Care;Review;SARS-CoV-2;Sample Size;Systematic Review;Systematic Reviews as Topic;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Toxicology;Treatment Outcome;United States;Urine","COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications, Infectious",Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

This study explored facilitators to recruitment in Miami, a successful recruiting site in the national trial. The mixed-methods study included quantitative surveys of randomized participants, medical record abstraction, and qualitative interviews with study staff. Miami recruited 47 (40.5%) of 116 randomized participants in the six-site national trial. In-depth interviews of study staff (n = 6) revealed that Miami had a recruitment approach consisting of street level outreach and a close relationship with the local syringe services program (SSP). Partnership with a local SSP provided access to people living with HIV who inject drugs in Miami.

34666636,2022,COVID-19-related policy changes for methadone take-home dosing: A multistate survey of opioid treatment program leadership.,"Background: In the United States, methadone for treatment of opioid use disorder is dispensed via highly-regulated accredited opioid treatment programs (OTP). During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal regulations were loosened, allowing for greater use of take-home methadone doses. We sought to understand how OTP leaders responded to these policy changes. Methods: We distributed a multistate electronic survey from September to November 2020 of OTP leadership to members of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (AATOD) who self-identified as leaders of OTPs. We asked study participants about how their OTP(s) implemented COVID-19-related policy changes into their clinical practice focusing on provision of take-home methadone doses, factors used to determine patient stability, and potential concerns about increased take-home doses. We used Chi-square test to compare survey responses between characterizations of the OTPs. Results: Of 170 survey respondents (17% response rate), the majority represented leadership of for-profit OTPs (69%) and were in a Southern state (54%). Routine allowances and practices related to take-home methadone doses varied across OTPs during the COVID-19 pandemic: 80 (47%) reported 14 days for newly enrolled patients (within past 90 days), 89 (52%) reported 14 days for ""less stable"" patients, and 112 (66%) reported 28 days for ""stable"" patients. Conclusions: We found that not all eligible OTP leaders adopted the practice of routinely allowing newly enrolled, ""less stable,"" and ""stable"" patients on methadone to have increased take-home doses up to the limit allowed by federal regulations during COVID-19. The pandemic provides an opportunity to critically re-evaluate long-established methadone and OTP regulations in preparation for future emergencies.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chi-Square Test;Electronics;Emergencies;Future;Humans;Leadership;Methadone;Methods;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Patients;Policy;Program;Regulation;Respondents;SARS-CoV-2;Self;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;United States",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34837879,2022,"Simulating the impact of Addiction Consult Services in the context of drug supply contamination, hospitalizations, and drug-related mortality.","Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) is increasing in international drug supply chains, and IMF-related opioid overdose deaths are rising in North America. Hospitalizations among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) are also rising; and, hospitalized patients are at increased risk of overdose and death following hospital discharge. Hospitalization is a key opportunity to engage patients with OUD. Addiction consult services (ACS) can provide effective treatment for patients hospitalized with OUD. This study aims to estimate the effect of increasing IMF contamination on drug-related death among patients hospitalized with OUD, and simulate the role of ACS expansion to mitigate these effects. We used a Markov model to mirror care systems for adult patients hospitalized with OUD in Oregon, from the time of hospital admission through 12-months post-discharge, and simulated patients through modeled care systems to evaluate the expansion of Addiction Consult Services in the context of increasing IMF in the drug supply. In a simulated cohort of 10,000 patients, we estimate that 537 patients would die from drug-related causes within 12-months of hospital discharge. In the context of increased IMF in the drug supply, this estimate increased to 913. ACS referral at baseline was 4%; increasing ACS referral to accommodate 10%, 50%, or 100% of hospitalized OUD patients in the state reduces drug-related deaths to 904, 849, and 780, respectively. The number needed to treat for ACS to avoid one drug-related death in the context of increased IMF was 73. Hospitals should expand interventions to help reduce IMF-related opioid overdoses, including through implementation of ACS. In the context of rising IMF-related deaths, ACS expansion could help connect patients to treatment, offer harm reduction interventions, or both, which can help reduce the risk of opioid-related death.","Adult;Aftercare;Analgesics, Opioid;Death;Drug Overdose;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Mortality;North America;Numbers Needed To Treat;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Patient Discharge;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Risk;Role;Supplies;Therapeutics;Time",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
34895346,2021,Rural opioid treatment program patient perspectives on take-home methadone policy changes during COVID-19: a qualitative thematic analysis.,"In the United States, methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly regulated. Federal agencies announced guidelines in March 2020 allowing for relaxation of take-home methadone dispensing at opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to improve treatment access and reduce COVID-19 transmission risk during the public health emergency. We explored patient perspectives at three OTPs serving rural communities on how take-home policy changes were received and implemented and how these changes impacted their addiction treatment and recovery. We completed semi-structured individual qualitative interviews in 2 phases: (1) August-October 2020 and (2) November 2020-January 2021 (total n = 46), anticipating possible policy changes as the pandemic progressed. We interviewed patients with OUD enrolled at 3 rural OTPs in Oregon. Participants received varying take-home methadone allowances following the COVID-19-related policy changes. All interviews were conducted via phone, audio-recorded, and transcribed. We conducted a thematic analysis, iteratively coding transcripts, and deductively and inductively generating codes. The 46 participants included 50% women and 89% had Medicaid insurance. Three main themes emerged in the analysis, with no differences between study phases: (1) Adapting to changing OTP policies throughout the pandemic; (2) Recognizing the benefits, and occasional struggles, with increased take-home methadone dosing; and (3) Continuing policies and procedures post-pandemic. Participants described fears and anxieties around ongoing methadone access and safety concerns prior to OTP policy changes, but quickly adapted as protocols soon seemed ""natural."" The majority of participants acknowledged significant benefits to increased take-homes independent of reducing COVID-19 infection risk including feeling ""more like a normal person,"" improved recovery support, reduced time traveling, and having more time with family and for work. Looking to a post-pandemic future, participants thought some COVID-19-related safety protocols should continue that would reduce risk of other infections, make OTP settings less stressful, and result in more individualized care. As the pandemic progressed, study participants adapted to rapidly changing OTP policies. Participants noted many unanticipated benefits to increased take-home methadone and other COVID-19 protocols including strengthened self-efficacy and recovery and reduced interpersonal conflict, with limited evidence of diversion. Patient perspectives should inform future policies to better address the ongoing overdose epidemic.","Addiction Medicine;Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;COVID-19;Coding;Emergencies;Epidemics;Family;Fear;Feelings;Future;Guideline;Humans;Infections;Insurance;Interview;Medicaid;Methadone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Oregon;Pandemics;Patients;Persons;Policy;Procedures;Program;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Relaxation;Risk;Rural Communities;Rural Population;SARS-CoV-2;Safety;Self Efficacy;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Thought;Time;United States;Women;Work",COVID-19;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

This study extends data from Oregon's only ACS to Oregon's 15 regional Medicaid Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) to illustrate the potential value of enhanced in- and out-patient care for hospitalized patients with OUD. The study objectives were to estimate the effects of (1) expanding ACS care through CCOs in Oregon, and (2) increasing community treatment access within CCOs, on post-discharge OUD treatment engagement. We used a validated Markov model, populated with Oregon Medicaid data from April 2015 to December 2017, to estimate study objectives. Oregon Medicaid patients hospitalized with OUD with care billed to a CCO (n = 5878) included 1298 (22.1%) patients engaged in post-discharge OUD treatment. Simulation of referral to an ACS increased post-discharge OUD treatment engagement to 47.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 45.7%, 48.3%), or 2684 patients (95% CI 2610, 2758). Ten of fifteen (66.7%) CCOs had fewer than 20% of patients engage in post-discharge OUD care. Without ACS, increasing outpatient treatment such that 20% of patients engage increased the patients engaging in post-discharge OUD care from 12.9% or 296 patients in care at baseline to 20% (95% CI 18.1%, 21.4%) or 453 (95% CI 416, 491). ACOs can improve care for patients hospitalized with OUD. Implementing ACS in ACO networks can potentially improve post-discharge OUD treatment engagement, but community treatment systems must be prepared to accept more patients as inpatient addiction care improves.",Accountable Care Organizations;Aftercare;Community;Confidence Intervals;Humans;Inpatients;Medicaid;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Oregon;Organizations;Outpatients;Patient Discharge;Patients;Referral;Referral and Consultation;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
35534663,2022,A Taxonomy of Hospital-Based Addiction Care Models: a Scoping Review and Key Informant Interviews.,"There is pressing need to improve hospital-based addiction care. Various models for integrating substance use disorder care into hospital settings exist, but there is no framework for describing, selecting, or comparing models. We sought to fill that gap by constructing a taxonomy of hospital-based addiction care models based on scoping literature review and key informant interviews. Methods included a scoping review of the literature on US hospital-based addiction care models and interventions for adults, published between January 2000 and July 2021. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 key informants experienced in leading, implementing, evaluating, andpracticing hospital-based addiction care to explore model characteristics, including their perceived strengths, limitations, and implementation considerations. We synthesized findings from the literature review and interviews to construct a taxonomy of model types. Searches identified 2,849 unique abstracts. Of these, we reviewed 280 full text articles, of which 76 were included in the final review. We added 8 references from reference lists and informant interviews, and 4 gray literature sources. We identified six distinct hospital-based addiction care models. Those classified as addiction consult models include (1) interprofessional addiction consult services, (2) psychiatry consult liaison services, and (3) individual consultant models. Those classified as practice-based models, wherein general hospital staff integrate addiction care into usual practice, include (4) hospital-based opioid treatment and (5) hospital-based alcohol treatment. The final type was (6) community-based in-reach, wherein community providers deliver care. Models vary in their target patient population, staffing, and core clinical and systems change activities. Limitations include that some models have overlapping characteristics and variable ways of delivering core components. A taxonomy provides hospital clinicians and administrators, researchers, and policy-makers with a framework to describe, compare, and select models for implementing hospital-based addiction care and measure outcomes.","Abstracts;Administrators;Adult;Alcohols;Behavior, Addictive;Community;Consultants;Gray Literature;Hospitals;Hospitals, General;Humans;Interview;Literature;Methods;Needs;Opioids;Outcome Measures;Patients;Policy Makers;Population;Psychiatry;Referral and Consultation;Research Personnel;Review;Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Substance-Related Disorders;Taxonomy;Therapeutics;Workforce",Substance Use Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Substance-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

35880813,2022,Management of opioid use disorder and associated conditions among hospitalized adults: A Consensus Statement from the Society of Hospital Medicine.,"Hospital-based clinicians frequently care for patients with opioid withdrawal or opioid use disorder (OUD) and are well-positioned to identify and initiate treatment for these patients. With rising numbers of hospitalizations related to opioid use and opioid-related overdose, the Society of Hospital Medicine convened a working group to develop a Consensus Statement on the management of OUD and associated conditions among hospitalized adults. The guidance statement is intended for clinicians practicing medicine in the inpatient setting (e.g., hospitalists, primary care physicians, family physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants) and is intended to apply to hospitalized adults at risk for, or diagnosed with, OUD. To develop the Consensus Statement, the working group conducted a systematic review of relevant guidelines and composed a draft statement based on extracted recommendations. Next, the working group obtained feedback on the draft statement from external experts in addiction medicine, SHM members, professional societies, harm reduction organizations and advocacy groups, and peer reviewers. The iterative development process resulted in a final Consensus Statement consisting of 18 recommendations covering the following topics: (1) identification and treatment of OUD and opioid withdrawal, (2) perioperative and acute pain management in patients with OUD, and (3) methods to optimize care transitions at hospital discharge for patients with OUD. Most recommendations in the Consensus Statement were derived from guidelines based on observational studies and expert consensus. Due to the lack of rigorous evidence supporting key aspects of OUD-related care, the working group identified important issues necessitating future research and exploration.","Acute Pain;Addiction Medicine;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Consensus;Feedback;Future;Guideline;Harm Reduction;Hospital Medicine;Hospitalists;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Inpatients;Medicine;Methods;Nurses;Observational Study;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Patient Transition;Patients;Physician Assistants;Physicians, Family;Physicians, Primary Care;Research;Risk;Societies;Systematic Review;Therapeutics",Acute Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Hosp Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)

We assessed quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Nineteen guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on observational studies or expert consensus. Guidelines recommended the use of nonstigmatizing language among patients with OUD; to assess patients with unhealthy opioid use for OUD using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Diseases-5th Edition criteria; use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat OUD and opioid withdrawal; use of multimodal, nonopioid therapy, and when needed, short-acting opioid analgesics in addition to buprenorphine or methadone, for acute pain management; ensuring linkage to ongoing methadone or buprenorphine treatment; referring patients to psychosocial treatment; and ensuring access to naloxone for opioid overdose reversal.

35986384,2022,Association between treatment setting and outcomes among oregon medicaid patients with opioid use disorder: a retrospective cohort study.,"Residential treatment is a common approach for treating opioid use disorder (OUD), however, few studies have directly compared it to outpatient treatment. The objective of this study was to compare OUD outcomes among individuals receiving residential and outpatient treatment. A retrospective cohort study used linked data from a state Medicaid program, vital statistics, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Episodes Dataset (TEDS) to compare OUD-related health outcomes among individuals treated in a residential or outpatient setting between 2014 and 2017. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models examined the association between treatment setting and outcomes (i.e., opioid overdose, non-overdose opioid-related and all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and treatment retention) controlling for patient characteristics, co-morbidities, and use of medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD). Interaction models evaluated how MOUD use modified associations between treatment setting and outcomes. Of 3293 individuals treated for OUD, 957 (29%) received treatment in a residential facility. MOUD use was higher among those treated as an outpatient (43%) compared to residential (19%). The risk of opioid overdose (aHR 1.39; 95% CI 0.73-2.64) or an opioid-related emergency department encounter or admission (aHR 1.02; 95% CI 0.80-1.29) did not differ between treatment settings. Independent of setting, MOUD use was associated with a significant reduction in overdose risk (aHR 0.45; 95% CI 0.23-0.89). Residential care was associated with greater odds of retention at 6-months (aOR 1.71; 95% CI 1.32-2.21) but not 1-year. Residential treatment was only associated with improved retention for individuals not receiving MOUD (6-month aOR 2.05; 95% CI 1.56-2.71) with no benefit observed in those who received MOUD (aOR 0.75; 95% CI 0.46-1.29; interaction p = 0.001). Relative to outpatient treatment, residential treatment was not associated with reductions in opioid overdose or opioid-related ED encounters/hospitalizations. Regardless of setting, MOUD use was associated with a significant reduction in opioid overdose risk.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Dataset;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Health;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Logistic Regression;Medicaid;Mental Health Services;Morbidity;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oregon;Outpatients;Patients;Program;Relatives;Residential Facilities;Residential Treatment;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Semantic Web;Substance Abuse;Therapeutics;United States;United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration;Vital Statistics",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,Addict Sci Clin Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
36401107,2022,Envisioning Minimally Disruptive Opioid Use Disorder Care.,"Most people who need and want treatment for opioid addiction cannot access it. Among those who do get treatment, only a fraction receive evidence-based, life-saving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD access is not simply a matter of needing more clinicians or expanding existing treatment capacity. Instead, many facets of our health systems and policies create unwarranted, inflexible, and punitive practices that create life-threatening barriers to care. In the USA, opioid use disorder care is maximally disruptive. Minimally disruptive medicine (MDM) is a framework that focuses on achieving patient goals while imposing the smallest possible burden on patients' lives. Using MDM framing, we highlight how current medical practices and policies worsen the burden of treatment and illness, compound life demands, and strain resources. We then offer suggestions for programmatic and policy changes that would reduce disruption to the lives of those seeking care, improve health care quality and delivery, begin to address disparities and inequities, and save lives.",Address;Goals;Health;Life;Medicine;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Policy;Quality of Health Care;Resources;Savings;Suggestion;Therapeutics,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Prevention of Progression to Moderate or Severe Opioid Use Disorder (STOP)
29596589,2018,Psychosocial Factors Associated with Problem Drinking Among Substance Users with Poorly Controlled HIV Infection.,"We aimed to identify psychosocial factors related to problem drinking among patients with poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We aimed to identify psychosocial factors related to problem drinking among those with poorly controlled HIV infection. Increased levels of interpersonal conflict were associated with greater severity of alcohol problems. Poorer mental health, medical mistrust and less satisfaction with one's physician related to excessive drinking. This secondary analysis used baseline data from a large multisite randomized controlled trial of substance users whose HIV infection was currently poorly controlled, from 11 urban hospitals across the USA. Participants were HIV-infected adult inpatients (n = 801; 67% male, 75% African American) with substance use histories. Participants self-reported on their drinking, perceived health, mental health, social relationships and patient-provider relationship. Structural equation models examined psychosocial factors associated with problem drinking, controlling for demographic covariates. Increased levels of interpersonal conflict were associated with greater severity of alcohol problems. Poorer mental health, medical mistrust and less satisfaction with one's physician were associated with excessive drinking. Several psychosocial factors, including interpersonal conflict, poor mental health (i.e. anxiety, depression and somatization), medical mistrust and less satisfaction with one's provider, were associated with problem drinking among HIV-infected substance users with poorly controlled HIV infection. The co-occurrence of these concerns highlights the need for comprehensive services (including attention to problem drinking, social services, mental health and quality medical care) in this at-risk group.","Adult;African Americans;Alcohol Problem;Alcoholism;Anxiety;Attention;Demography;Depression;Drinking;Drug Users;Female;HIV;HIV Infections;Health;Health Surveys;History;Hospitals, Urban;Humans;Inpatients;Interpersonal Relations;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Needs;Patients;Physicians;Psychosocial Factors;Randomized Controlled Trial;Risk;Risk Factors;Satisfaction;Self;Social Work;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders",Alcohol Problem;Alcoholism;HIV Infections;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Alcohol Alcohol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of monthly injectable bupreno"

Gender and/or racial/ethnic differences in health benefits and response to prescribed exercise have been reported and may have implications for designing exercise interventions in SUD programs. Data are from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (NIDA/CTN) Stimulant Reduction Intervention using Dosed Exercise (STRIDE) trial. Gender differences across racial/ethnic groups in physiological responses and stimulant withdrawal severity across time were analyzed using linear mixed effects models. Males completed significantly more exercise sessions than females and were more adherent to the prescribed exercise dose of 12 Kcal/Kg/Week. Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, treatment group and stimulant withdrawal severity, there was a significant gender by time interaction for body mass index (BMI) (p &lt; 0.001), waist circumference (p &lt; 0.001) and heart rate measured prior to exercise sessions (p &lt; 0.01). For females, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference increased over time while for males BMI and waist circumference stayed unchanged or slightly decreased with time. Heart rate over time significantly increased for females at a higher rate than in males. Stimulant withdrawal severity was similar in males and females at baseline but males exhibited a significant decrease over time while females did not. Although baseline differences were observed, there were no time by race/ethnicity differences in physiologic responses.

We used a transdisciplinary and theory-driven approach to adapt and rapidly scale up an existing, previously successful DEA X-waiver initiative. Pre-implementation activities included a literature review to identify OUD treatment barriers and demographic analyses to identify high-need areas of the state. We used geospatial mapping methods to identify regions with highest point prevalence of opioid-overdose mortality and low access to a buprenorphine provider. The study team used the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support implementation of evidence-based practices. In six months, we trained 451 waiver eligible providers, 133 (29%) of whom received waivers by 6 months post-training. Of the 163 (36.1%) providers who completed the post-waiver evaluation, 97% reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the training. Our initiative delivered high quality education to providers and increased the number of waiver trainers in Texas from eight to thirteen. Despite recent changes to the DEA X-waiver process, barriers to treating OUD with buprenorphine remain. Lack of education and experience treating substance use disorders remains a significant factor in limiting clinician comfort in prescribing buprenorphine. The research team successfully adapted a Texas-wide initiative to increase the number of office-based providers eligible to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD from an existing single-site initiative. Attentiveness to barriers pre-implementation and to adaptations during implementation enabled moderate impact across a large network in a short time and facilitated program sustainment.","Address;Buprenorphine;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Demographic Analysis;Education;Evidence-Based Practice;Health Personnel;Humans;Implementation Science;Literature;Methods;Mortality;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Point Prevalence;Program;Research;Review;Scales;Substance Use Disorders;Texas;Therapeutics;Time;Training Programs",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of monthly injectable bupreno"
35552721,2022,Survey of Barriers and Facilitators to Prescribing Buprenorphine and Clinician Perceptions on the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 Waiver.,"As opioid-related deaths continue to climb, methods to reduce barriers to prescribing buprenorphine for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed. Recent conversations by state and federal authorities targeting low-threshold buprenorphine aim to reduce some barriers to prescribing buprenorphine; however, what remains unclear is whether removal of the requirement to obtain a waiver for prescribing buprenorphine through the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (an X-waiver) will be enough to increase access to buprenorphine. To assess barriers and facilitators of obtaining an X-waiver and prescribing buprenorphine. This mixed-method survey study was conducted between September and December 2020; 607 office-based Texas clinicians were surveyed after they attended a buprenorphine X-waiver training course. All attendees between March 2, 2019, and February 28, 2020, were eligible to receive this survey; 126 responses were received (20% response rate: 81 physicians, 37 nurse practitioners, and 8 physician assistants). Data analysis was performed October 2021. Surveys measured the extent to which clinicians experienced 9 previously identified barriers during the waiver process and in prescribing buprenorphine. The survey included open-ended items assessing facilitating factors to obtaining a waiver and to prescribing buprenorphine for OUD. The barriers were analyzed using χ2 tests of homogeneity. Qualitative data were analyzed using a constant comparative method. Among 126 clinicians who responded, 61 (48.4%) had received an X-waiver; of these waivered clinicians, 22 (36%) were prescribing buprenorphine and 39 (64%) were not. ""Complexity of X-waiver process,"" ""Perceived lack of professional support and referral network,"" and ""Getting started"" were significantly different barriers among waivered and nonwaivered clinicians. Significant differences in barriers experienced between prescribers and nonprescribers were ""Getting started"" and ""Accessing reimbursement for treatment."" The most frequently mentioned facilitators involved changes to the waiver training and the need for networks connecting experienced clinicians with those in the initial stages of readiness for prescribing buprenorphine for OUD. This survey study's results contribute new understanding of facilitators to obtaining the X-waiver and to prescribing buprenorphine. Furthermore, these findings suggest that to increase access to compassionate evidence-based treatment for OUD, clinicians need ongoing support and mentorship from experienced and knowledgeable clinicians. Interventions aimed at improving access to buprenorphine should focus on facilitating such networks to increase the number of clinicians who obtain an X-waiver and prescribe buprenorphine for OUD.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Comprehension;Data Analysis;Death;Drug Dependence;Humans;Mentorships;Methods;Needs;News;Nurse Practitioners;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Perception;Physician Assistants;Physicians;Referral;Survey Methods;Surveys;Texas;Therapeutics",Death;Drug Dependence;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,"Enhanced NIDA Clinical Trials Network to study OUD;Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of monthly injectable bupreno"
29649035,2019,"Pharmacological Characterization of Levorphanol, a G-Protein Biased Opioid Analgesic.","Levorphanol is a potent analgesic that has been used for decades. Most commonly used for acute and cancer pain, it also is effective against neuropathic pain. The recent appreciation of the importance of functional bias and the uncovering of multiple µ opioid receptor splice variants may help explain the variability of patient responses to different opioid drugs. Here, we evaluate levorphanol in a variety of traditional in vitro receptor binding and functional assays. In vivo analgesia studies using the radiant heat tail flick assay explored the receptor selectivity of the responses through the use of knockout (KO) mice, selective antagonists, and viral rescue approaches. Receptor binding studies revealed high levorphanol affinity for all the μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors. In S-GTPγS binding assays, it was a full agonist at most µ receptor subtypes, with the exception of MOR-1O, but displayed little activity in β-arrestin2 recruitment assays, indicating a preference for G-protein transduction mechanisms. A KO mouse and selective antagonists confirmed that levorphanol analgesia was mediated through classical µ receptors, but there was a contribution from 6 transmembrane targets, as illustrated by a lower response in an exon 11 KO mouse and its rescue with a virally transfected 6 transmembrane receptor splice variant. Compared to morphine, levorphanol had less respiratory depression at equianalgesic doses. While levorphanol shares many of the same properties as the classic opioid morphine, it displays subtle differences that may prove helpful in its clinical use. Its G-protein signaling bias is consistent with its diminished respiratory depression, while its incomplete cross tolerance with morphine suggests it may prove valuable clinically with opioid rotation.","Analgesia;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Bias;Binding Proteins;Cancer Pain;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Exons;GTP-Binding Proteins;Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate);Heat;In Vitro;Levorphanol;Mice;Mice, 129 Strain;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Morphine;Neuralgia;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiratory Depression;Rotation;Tail;beta-Arrestin 2",Cancer Pain;Neuralgia;Respiratory Depression,Anesth Analg,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31103778,2019,Kratom policy: The challenge of balancing therapeutic potential with public safety.,"Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree-like plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its leaves, and the teas brewed from them have long been used by people in that region to stave off fatigue and to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. Evidence suggests kratom is being increasingly used by people in the United States and Europe for the self-management of opioid withdrawal and treatment of pain. Recent studies have confirmed that kratom and its chemical constituents have potentially useful pharmacological actions. However, there have also been increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects resulting from use of kratom products. In August 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration announced plans to classify kratom and its mitragynine constituents as Schedule I Controlled Substances, a move that triggered a massive response from pro-kratom advocates. The debate regarding the risks, and benefits and safety of kratom continues to intensify. Kratom proponents tout kratom as a safer and less addictive alternative to opioids for the management of pain and opioid addiction. The anti-kratom faction argues that kratom, itself, is a dangerous and addictive drug that ought to be banned. Given the widespread use of kratom and the extensive media attention it is receiving, it is important for physicians, scientists and policy makers to be knowledgeable about the subject. The purpose of this commentary is to update readers about recent developments and controversies in this rapidly evolving area. All of the authors are engaged in various aspects of kratom research and it is our intention to provide a fair and balanced overview that can form the basis for informed decisions on kratom policy. Our conclusions from these analyses are: (a) User reports and results of preclinical studies in animals strongly suggest that kratom and its main constituent alkaloid, mitragynine may have useful activity in alleviating pain and managing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, even though well-controlled clinical trials have yet to be done. (b) Even though kratom lacks many of the toxicities of classic opioids, there are legitimate concerns about the safety and lack of quality control of purported ""kratom"" products that are being sold in the US. (c) The issues regarding the safety and efficacy of kratom and its mitragynine constituent can only be resolved by additional research. Classification of the Mitragyna alkaloids as Schedule I controlled substances would substantially impede this important research on kratom.","Administration;Alkaloids;Animals;Asia, Southeastern;Attention;Classification;Comment;Controlled Clinical Trial;Controlled Substances;Drug and Narcotic Control;Europe;Fatigue;Form;Humans;Intention;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Plant Extracts;Plant Leaves;Plants;Policy;Policy Makers;Quality Control;Report;Research;Risks and Benefits;Safety;Schedules;Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids;Self-Management;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Tea;Therapeutics;Trees;United States",Fatigue;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Int J Drug Policy,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31385846,2020,Drug Legalization and Decriminalization Beliefs Among Substance-using and Nonusing Individuals.,"There has been advocacy for legalization of abusable substances, but systematic data on societal beliefs regarding such legalization are limited. People who use substances may have unique beliefs about legalization, and this study assessed whether they would be in favor of drug legalization/decriminalization. It was hypothesized that those who use particular drugs (especially marijuana) would support its legalization/decriminalization, but that this would not be the case across all classes (especially opioids and stimulants). A nationwide sample of 506 adults were surveyed online to assess demographic characteristics, substance misuse, and beliefs regarding drug legalization/decriminalization. Legalization/decriminalization beliefs for specific drugs were assessed on an 11-point scale (0, strongly disagree; 10, strongly agree). For persons with opioid misuse (15.4%), when asked about their agreement with: ""heroin should be legalized,"" the mean score was 4.6 (SEE = 0.4; neutral). For persons with stimulant misuse (12.1%), when asked about their agreement with: ""cocaine should be legalized,"" the score was 4.2 (0.5). However, for persons with marijuana misuse (34.0%), when asked about their agreement with: ""medical marijuana should be legalized"" the score was 8.2 (0.3; indicating agreement), and for ""recreational marijuana"" the score was also 8.2 (0.3). These results suggest that persons who used marijuana strongly support the legalization of both recreational and medical marijuana, whereas persons who primarily have opioid or stimulant misuse have less strongly held beliefs about legalization of substances within those respective categories. By including those who misuse drugs, these data assist in framing discussions of drug legalization and have the potential to inform drug policy considerations.","Adult;Attitude to Health;Beliefs;Cannabis;Classification;Cocaine;Demography;Drug Misuse;Female;Heroin;Humans;Legislation, Drug;Male;Marijuana Use;Medical Marijuana;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Scales;Substance Use;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;Young Adult",Marijuana Use;Opioid Misuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Addict Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31391211,2019,Non-Opioid Neurotransmitter Systems that Contribute to the Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: A Review of Preclinical and Human Evidence.,"Opioid misuse and abuse is a major international public health issue. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is largely maintained by a desire to suppress aversive opioid withdrawal symptoms. Opioid withdrawal in patients seeking abstinence from illicit or prescribed opioids is often managed by provision of a μ-opioid agonist/partial agonist in combination with concomitant medications. Concomitant medications are administered based on their ability to treat specific symptoms rather than a mechanistic understanding of the opioid withdrawal syndrome; however, their use has not been statistically associated with improved treatment outcomes. Understanding the central and/or peripheral mechanisms that underlie individual withdrawal symptom expression in humans will help promote medication development for opioid withdrawal management. To support focused examination of mechanistically supported concomitant medications, this review summarizes evidence from preclinical (N = 68) and human (N = 30) studies that administered drugs acting on the dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoid, orexin/hypocretin, and glutamate systems and reported outcomes related to opioid withdrawal. These studies provide evidence that each of these systems contribute to opioid withdrawal severity. The Food and Drug Administration has approved medications acting on these respective systems for other indications and research in this area could support the repurposing of these medications to enhance opioid withdrawal treatment. These data support a focused examination of mechanistically informed concomitant medications to help reduce opioid withdrawal severity and enhance the continuum of care available for persons with OUD.","Ability;Analgesics, Opioid;Cannabinoids;Clinical Trials as Topic;Comprehension;Continuity of Patient Care;Dopamine;Drug Development;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Glutamates;Glutamic Acid;Humans;Narcotic Antagonists;Neurotransmitter Agents;Neurotransmitters;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Orexins;Partial Opioid Agonists;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Public Health;Research;Review;Serotonin;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States Food and Drug Administration;Withdrawal Symptoms",Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31710994,2019,Individual differences in human opioid abuse potential as observed in a human laboratory study.,"Opioids have high abuse potential and pose a major public health concern. Yet, a large percentage of individuals exposed to opioids do not develop problematic use. Individual differences in opioid abuse potential are not well understood. This within-subject (N = 16), double-blind, double-dummy, human laboratory study evaluated individual differences in response to dose (placebo, low, medium, high) following administration of heroin and hydromorphone through intravenous and subcutaneous routes, in opioid-experienced but non physically-dependent participants. Outcomes were self-reported visual analog scale (VAS) ratings (High, Liking, Drug Effect, Good Effect, Rush), pupil diameter change from baseline, and crossover point on the Drug vs. Money questionnaire. The degree to which results were consistent across measures within an individual was assessed using a mixed-effects model from which an intraclass correlation coefficient measure of between and within-subject variance was derived. The mixed effects model fit was significant (p &lt; 0.0001) and revealed that 85.5% of the explainable variance was due to between-subject effects, suggesting the responses within an individual were highly consistent. Visual inspection reveals a myriad response pattern across participants, with some demonstrating classic dose-effect responses and others not differentiating any active doses from placebo. Data suggest the abuse potential of opioids is significantly different between individuals but that the experience within an individual is highly consistent. Research to prospectively characterize and evaluate mechanisms underlying these differences is warranted and may provide a foundation to help identify persons at heightened risk of transitioning from opioid exposure to misuse and/or opioid use disorder.","Administration;Administration, Intravenous;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Cross-Over Studies;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Double-Blind Method;Emotions;Female;Foundations;Heroin;Humans;Hydromorphone;Individuality;Injections, Subcutaneous;Laboratories;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Opioid Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placebos;Precision Medicine;Public Health;Pupil;Questionnaires;Research;Risk;Self;Self Report;Visual Analog Scale",Opioid Abuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31757261,2019,Differential adoption of opioid agonist treatments in detoxification and outpatient settings.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health problem for which a substantial amount of treatment exists. The degree to which methadone and buprenorphine are administered in different treatment modalities is not clear but critical to understanding treatment success rates and service development strategies. Data from the national Treatment Episode Dataset for Admissions and Discharges (TEDS-A [N = 4,070,264] and TEDS-D [832,731], respectively) were used to determine the likelihood patients initiating detoxification and outpatient OUD treatment between 2006 and 2015 were expected to receive opioid agonist treatment. Joinpoint regression evaluated significant trends and a generalized linear model with logit link function identified characteristics associated with receiving an agonist during detoxification. TEDS-D informed the percent of patients leaving detoxification against medical advice who did/did not receive an opioid agonist. Though agonist use in outpatient settings increased by 60% during 2012-2015, agonist use in detoxification was lower than outpatient treatment, decreased significantly by 26% from 2009 to 2015, and never exceeded 16% of detoxification admissions during 2006-2015. In 2015, persons who were under 25, homeless, had co-occurring psychiatric problems, utilized Medicare, Medicaid, or had no insurance, and had no prior OUD treatment or were high treatment utilizers were the least likely to receive an agonist during detoxification. Efforts to expand opioid agonist access has been successful for outpatient but not detoxification settings. Improving detoxification outcomes is a potentially high impact way for the US to expand efficacious OUD treatment access in the US.","Adoption;Adult;Age Factors;Ambulatory Care;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Comorbidity;Comprehension;Dataset;Datasets as Topic;Female;Homeless Persons;Humans;Insurance;Linear Models;Male;Medicaid;Medicare;Methadone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;Outpatients;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient Compliance;Patients;Persons;Public Health;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
31964691,2020,An fMRI-based neural marker for migraine without aura.,"To identify and validate an fMRI-based neural marker for migraine without aura (MwoA) and to examine its association with treatment response. We conducted cross-sectional studies with resting-state fMRI data from 230 participants and machine learning analyses. In studies 1 through 3, we identified, cross-validated, independently validated, and cross-sectionally validated an fMRI-based neural marker for MwoA. In study 4, we assessed the relationship between the neural marker and treatment responses in migraineurs who received a 4-week real or sham acupuncture treatment, or were waitlisted, in a registered clinical trial. In study 1 (n = 116), we identified a neural marker with abnormal functional connectivity within the visual, default mode, sensorimotor, and frontal-parietal networks that could discriminate migraineurs from healthy controls (HCs) with 93% sensitivity and 89% specificity. In study 2 (n = 38), we investigated the generalizability of the marker by applying it to an independent cohort of migraineurs and HCs and achieved 84% sensitivity and specificity. In study 3 (n = 76), we verified the specificity of the marker with new datasets of migraineurs and patients with other chronic pain disorders (chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia) and demonstrated 78% sensitivity and 76% specificity for discriminating migraineurs from nonmigraineurs. In study 4 (n = 116), we found that the changes in the marker responses showed significant correlation with the changes in headache frequency in response to real acupuncture. We identified an fMRI-based neural marker that captures distinct characteristics of MwoA and can link disease pattern changes to brain changes.",Acupuncture;Acupuncture Therapy;Association;Brain;Chronic Pain;Clinical Trial;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dataset;Disease;Fibromyalgia;Headache;Humans;Low Back Pain;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Migraine without Aura;News;Patients;Sensitivity;Sensitivity and Specificity;Specificity;Therapeutics;fMRI,Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia;Headache;Low Back Pain;Migraine without Aura,Neurology,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
32031650,2020,Differences in Availability and Use of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Residential Treatment Settings in the United States.,"While many individuals with opioid use disorder seek treatment at residential facilities to initiate long-term recovery, the availability and use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs) in these facilities is unclear. To examine differences in MOUD availability and use in residential facilities as a function of Medicaid policy, facility-level factors associated with MOUD availability, and admissions-level factors associated with MOUD use. This cross-sectional study used deidentified facility-level and admissions-level data from 2863 residential treatment facilities and 232 414 admissions in the United States in 2017. Facility-level data were extracted from the 2017 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, and admissions-level data were extracted from the 2017 Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions. Statistical analyses were conducted from June to November 2019. Admissions for opioid use disorder at residential treatment facilities in the United States that identified opioids as the patient's primary drug of choice. Availability and use of 3 MOUDs (ie, extended-release naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone). Of 232 414 admissions, 205 612 (88.5%) contained complete demographic data (166 213 [80.8%] aged 25-54 years; 136 854 [66.6%] men; 151 867 [73.9%] white). Among all admissions, MOUDs were used in only 34 058 of 192 336 (17.7%) in states that expanded Medicaid and 775 of 40 078 (1.9%) in states that did not expand Medicaid (P &lt; .001). A relatively low percentage of the 2863 residential treatment facilities in this study offered extended-release naltrexone (854 [29.8%]), buprenorphine (953 [33.3%]), or methadone (60 [2.1%]). Compared with residential facilities that offered at least 1 MOUD, those that offered no MOUDs had lower odds of also offering psychiatric medications (odds ratio [OR], 0.06; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08; Wald χ21 = 542.09; P &lt; .001), being licensed by a state or hospital authority (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.57; Wald χ21 = 24.28; P &lt; .001), or being accredited by a health organization (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.33; Wald χ21 = 180.91; P &lt; .001). Residential facilities that did not offer any MOUDs had higher odds of accepting cash-only payments than those that offered at least 1 MOUD (OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 3.47-6.64; Wald χ21 = 89.65; P &lt; .001). In this cross-sectional study of residential addiction treatment facilities in the United States, MOUD availability and use were sparse. Public health and policy efforts to improve access to and use of MOUDs in residential treatment facilities could improve treatment outcomes for individuals with opioid use disorder who are initiating recovery.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dataset;Demography;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Hospitals;Humans;Medicaid;Men;Methadone;Naltrexone;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Public Health;Residential Facilities;Residential Treatment;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Surveys;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;United States;Whites",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,JAMA Netw Open,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
32113032,2020,Advances in the In vitro and In vivo pharmacology of Alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor positive allosteric modulators.,"Receptors containing α4 and β2 subunits are a major neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype in the brain. This receptor plays a critical role in nicotine addiction, with potential smoking cessation therapeutics producing modulation of α4β2 nAChR. In addition, compounds that act as agonists at α4β2 nAChR may be useful for the treatment of pathological pain. Further, as the α4β2 nAChR has been implicated in cognition, therapeutics that act as α4β2 nAChR agonists are also being examined as treatments for cognitive disorders and neurological diseases that impact cognitive function, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. This review will cover the molecular in vitro evidence that allosteric modulators of the α4β2 neuronal nAChR provide several advantages over traditional α4β2 nAChR orthosteric ligands. Specifically, we explore the concept that nAChR allosteric modulators allow for greater pharmacological selectivity, while minimizing potential deleterious off-target effects. Further, here we discuss the development and preclinical in vivo behavioral assessment of allosteric modulators at the α4β2 neuronal nAChR as therapeutics for smoking cessation, pathological pain, as well as cognitive disorders and neurological diseases that impact cognitive function.

32380144,2020,Alterations in mouse spinal cord and sciatic nerve microRNAs after the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain.,"Pain is one of the most common reasons to seek medical attention and chronic pain is a worldwide epidemic. There are currently no relevant biomarkers for the diagnosis of chronic pain, and new therapeutic strategies for chronic pain treatment are desperately needed. The chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve is a widely used preclinical model of pathological neuropathic pain. Over the past decade, investigators have come to appreciate the many contributions of noncoding RNA including microRNA (miRNA), and other long and short noncoding (nc) RNAs. The development and/or maintenance of chronic pain could be controlled epigenetically through ncRNAs. Here we seek to characterize CNS tissues in a mouse model of neuropathic pain as this may serve to elucidate potential biomarkers relevant to pathological pain in humans. Male C57BL6/J mice (6 CCI and 6 sham procedure) underwent surgery for sciatic nerve ligation with chromic gut sutures. Following 7 days, mechanical allodynia was quantified using the von Frey assay. Mice were then euthanized for collection of spinal cord and sciatic nerve. cDNA was synthesized to 627 unique mature miRNAs from the total RNA. In the CCI mice that displayed mechanical allodynia, 11 and 125 miRNAs were differentially expressed (i.e., greater than 1.5-fold increase or decrease; P &lt; 0.05) in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve, respectively, as compared to sham controls. Among those differentially expressed miRNAs in the sciatic nerve of CCI mice, the following passed the more stringent Bonfferoni correction: miR-138-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-676-3p, reduced and miR-142-5p, increased. Our data support miRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of pathological pain.","Allodynia;Animals;Attention;Biomarkers;Chronic Pain;Collection;Constriction;DNA, Complementary;Diagnosis;Disease Models, Animal;Epidemics;General Surgery;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Ligation;Maintenance;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;MicroRNAs;Neuralgia;News;Pain;Procedures;RNA;RNA, Untranslated;Research Personnel;Sciatic Nerve;Spinal Cord;Sutures;Therapeutics;Tissues",Allodynia;Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain,Neurosci Lett,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
32572978,2021,Method for Successfully Inducting Individuals Who Use Illicit Fentanyl Onto Buprenorphine/Naloxone.,Individuals exposed to fentanyl are at risk of precipitated withdrawal using typical buprenorphine/naloxone induction procedures. This case series describes buprenorphine/naloxone inductions of four individuals who tested positive for fentanyl. Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal was observed in two individuals who completed a conventional buprenorphine/naloxone induction strategy. Two more individuals completed a revised buprenorphine/naloxone induction strategy that did not precipitate withdrawal. Using multiple 2 mg doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in patients already in mild/moderate withdrawal improved outcomes. Persons who use illicit fentanyl might be less likely to experience precipitated withdrawal from this revised buprenorphine/naloxone induction strategy.

32650192,2020,Protracted renal clearance of fentanyl in persons with opioid use disorder.,"The illicit opioid supply in the U.S. is increasingly adulterated with fentanyl. As such, persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) may be regularly exposed to fentanyl, however, the pharmacokinetics of repeated fentanyl exposure are not well understood. The current study aimed to quantify renal clearance of fentanyl in OUD patients presenting to residential treatment. Participants (N = 12) who presented to a 28-day residential treatment program were enrolled if they tested positive for fentanyl at intake. Urine samples were collected every 2-3 days and were quantitatively tested for fentanyl, norfentanyl, and creatinine via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Fentanyl clearance was defined as the time since last illicit opioid use and the median time between last positive and first negative fentanyl urine screen. Participants had a mean and standard deviation (SD) age of 28.9 (11.0), were 67 % male, and 83 % white. The mean (SD) time for fentanyl and norfentanyl clearance was 7.3 (4.9) and 13.3 (6.9) days, respectively. One participant continued to test positive for fentanyl for 19 days and norfentanyl for 26 days following their last use, and left treatment without testing negative for norfentanyl. Fentanyl clearance in persons with OUD is considerably longer than the typical 2-4 day clearance of other short-acting opioids. The findings of this study might explain recent reports of difficulty in buprenorphine inductions for persons who use fentanyl, and point to a need to better understand the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl in the context of opioid withdrawal in persons who regularly use fentanyl.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Chromatography, Liquid;Creatinine;Drug Contamination;Female;Fentanyl;Heroin;Humans;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Middle Aged;Narcotics;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmacokinetics;Program;Report;Residential Treatment;Standards;Supplies;Therapeutics;Time;Urine;Whites",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
32781310,2020,"Differences in patient-reported and observer-rated opioid withdrawal symptom etiology, time course, and relationship to clinical outcome.","Although opioid withdrawal ratings are frequently used as primary outcomes for therapeutic trials, there has been limited empirical examination of opioid withdrawal symptom onset or etiology as an outcome, and also little examination of differences in outcomes between patient-reported and observer-ratings of withdrawal. Patient-reported (Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale, SOWS) and observer ratings (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, COWS) of opioid withdrawal collected as part of a randomized controlled residential clonidine, tramadol-extended release, and buprenorphine/naloxone 7-day taper for opioid withdrawal management were analyzed. Withdrawal ratings were collected seven times daily and primary outcomes were percent of participants (N = 103) endorsing symptoms, time of symptom onset, and relationship of scales to taper completion. Participants had variable endorsement of specific symptoms, ranging from 37 % (""feel like vomiting"") to 97 % (""change in resting pulse""). Symptoms were more likely to be reported on the SOWS than COWS. Most symptoms began around 8 h after last dose, though comparison of like symptoms across the scales revealed patients reported symptoms on the SOWS &gt; 10 h before they were observed on the COWS. SOWS peak severity score was more closely associated with taper completion than the COWS. Data suggest the patient-reported SOWS demonstrated a higher level of symptom endorsement, earlier detection of symptom onset, and better association with taper completion relative to the observer rated COWS. These data provide insight into the etiology of opioid withdrawal symptom expression and time course that can be used to inform treatment intervention timing and provide a baseline for other withdrawal evaluations.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Association;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clonidine;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Narcotic Antagonists;Narcotics;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patient Reported Outcome Measures;Patients;Pulse;Relatives;Scales;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Swine;Therapeutics;Time;Tramadol;Vomiting;Withdrawal Symptoms",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Vomiting;Withdrawal Symptoms,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
33022538,2021,"The association of prefrontal cortex response during a natural reward cue-reactivity paradigm, anhedonia, and demoralization in persons maintained on methadone.","Persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) often experience anhedonia and demoralization, yet there is relatively little research on the pathophysiology of anhedonia and demoralization in OUD treatment and recovery. In the current study, persons maintained on methadone (N = 29) underwent a natural reward-cue paradigm during functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging. Natural reward cues included highly palatable food, positive social interactions (e.g., a happy family at the dinner table), and emotional intimacy (e.g. couples embracing or kissing, but no erotic images). Participants also self-reported symptoms of anhedonia on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHPS) and demoralization on the Demoralization Scale II (DS-II). Participants who reported clinically-significant anhedonia on the SHPS displayed decreased neural activity in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) in response to natural reward cues (F(1,25) = 3.612, p = 0.027, ηp2 = 0.302). In linear regression models of positive social cues, decreased neural activity in the right VMPFC was associated with increased SHPS total score (F(1,27) = 7.131, R2 = 0.209, p = .013), and decreased neural activity in an area encompassing the right lateral VMPFC and DLPFC was associated with increased DS-II total score (F(1,27) = 10.641, R2 = 0.283, p = 0.003). This study provides initial evidence that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the pathophysiology of anhedonia and demoralization in persons in recovery from OUD. Anhedonia and demoralization are important treatment outcomes that should be queried along with a constellation of physical and mental health outcomes, to assess areas of needed improvement in methadone maintenance and other OUD treatment modalities.","Anhedonia;Association;Couples;Cues;Demoralization;Depressive Symptoms;Dinner;Family;Food;Humans;Linear Regression;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maintenance;Mental Health;Methadone;Opioid Use Disorder;Persons;Pleasure;Prefrontal Cortex;Research;Reward;Scales;Self;Social Interaction;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Tables;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome",Anhedonia;Opioid Use Disorder,Addict Behav,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
33128093,2020,Challenges for Women Entering Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Women with opioid use disorder (OUD) face unique challenges the moment they enter treatment. This narrative review focused on recent literature regarding sex- and gender-based issues that could affect treatment outcomes in women with OUD. Women respond differently to opioids based on hormonal factors, are more likely to present to treatment with mental health conditions, especially depression, and are more likely to have experienced trauma via intimate partner violence compared with men. Women also face stigma when entering OUD treatment, particularly if they have children. Future research to improve OUD treatment outcomes in women should account for sex as a biological variable and gender as a social construct. Women have a fundamentally different experience than men during the course of OUD and upon treatment entry. Programs that address childcare/family support, mental health, and trauma are warranted for women with OUD.","Address;Affect;Analgesics, Opioid;Biopharmaceuticals;Child;Depression;Face;Family;Female;Future;Gender;Humans;Intimate Partner Violence;Literature;Male;Men;Mental Health;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Program;Research;Review;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Women;Wounds and Injuries",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Wounds and Injuries,Curr Psychiatry Rep,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
33560698,2022,Treatment Disruption and Childcare Responsibility as Risk Factors for Drug and Alcohol Use in Persons in Treatment for Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Crisis.,"The novel 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has caused considerable upheaval in the U.S. healthcare system. The current study examined patient-reported experiences in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants in SUD treatment were recruited via online crowdsourcing from April 14, 2020 to May 26, 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants reported disruptions in SUD treatment, stress and anxiety caused by these disruptions on a 0-100 point visual analogue scale (VAS), stress associated with childcare responsibilities on a 0-100 VAS, current stress on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), anxiety symptoms on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), sleep disturbances on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and whether they used drugs or alcohol during the COVID-19 crisis. Participants (N = 240) endorsed that at least 1 SUD treatment was switched to telemedicine (63.7%), had some appointments cancelled (37.5%), or was discontinued due to COVID-19 (29.6%). Participants who did versus did not endorse drug/alcohol use reported difficulty obtaining medications to treat their SUD (OR = 2.47, 95% CI, 1.17-5.22, χ2 = 5.98, P = .016), greater scores on VAS treatment-related stress (F1,197 = 5.70, P = .018) and anxiety (F1,197 = 4.07, P = .045), greater VAS stress related to childcare (F1,107 = 10.24, P = .002), and greater scores on the PSS (F1,235 = 19.27, P &lt; .001), BAI (F1,235 = 28.59, P &lt; .001), and ISI (F1,235 = 14.41, P &lt; .001).

33956427,2021,"Novel Approaches, Drug Candidates, and Targets in Pain Drug Discovery.","Because of the problems associated with opioids, drug discovery efforts have been employed to develop opioids with reduced side effects using approaches such as biased opioid agonism, multifunctional opioids, and allosteric modulation of opioid receptors. Receptor targets such as adrenergic, cannabinoid, P2X3 and P2X7, NMDA, serotonin, and sigma, as well as ion channels like the voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 have been targeted to develop novel analgesics. Several enzymes, such as soluble epoxide hydrolase, sepiapterin reductase, and MAGL/FAAH, have also been targeted to develop novel analgesics. In this review, old and recent targets involved in pain signaling and compounds acting at these targets are summarized.

34242797,2021,The use of hypercapnic conditions to assess opioid-induced respiratory depression in rats.,"Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) in unrestrained, non-anesthetized rodents is a preclinical method to assess the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, the leading cause of opioid overdose death in humans. However, low baseline respiration rates under normocapnic conditions (i.e., ""floor"" effect) can render the measurement of respiratory decreases challenging. We assessed hypercapnia-induced increases in respiration as a strategy to assess opioid-induced decreases in respiration in rats. WBP was used to assess respiration frequency, tidal volume and minute volume in the presence of normocapnic and hypercapnic (8% CO2) conditions in rats during the rat diurnal period of the light cycle. The mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl was administered intravenously, and the hot plate test was used to assess acute antinociception. Hypercapnia-induced increases in respiratory parameters (frequency, minute volume, and tidal volume) were decreased by fentanyl at doses that did not decrease the same parameters under the normocapnic conditions. These findings show that hypercapnia increases sensitivity to respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl, as compared with assessments during the rat diurnal period when activity and breathing rate are generally low, i.e., there is a floor effect. The current approach is highly sensitive to opioid-induced respiratory depression, and therefore provides a useful method for assessment in a pre-clinical setting.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Death;Fentanyl;Floors;Humans;Hypercapnia;Light Cycle;Methods;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Plethysmography, Whole Body;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Respiration;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency;Respiratory Rate;Rodentia;Safety;Sensitivity;Tidal Volume",Death;Hypercapnia;Opiate Overdose;Respiratory Depression;Respiratory Insufficiency,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
34264734,2021,The discounting of death: Probability discounting of heroin use by fatal overdose likelihood and drug purity.,"As fatal overdoses from synthetic opioids continue to rise, we need to understand decision-making processes underlying heroin and synthetic opioid use. This study evaluated the influence of sample impurity and fatal overdose risk on hypothetical heroin use. Individuals who currently use heroin (n = 69) were recruited online. Participants completed two probability-discounting tasks evaluating the likelihood of using a sample of heroin based on the likelihood of sample impurity and likelihood of fatal overdose, where greater discounting represented reduced use likelihood. Prior to completing the probability-discounting tasks, participants were randomized to read one of four prompts varying by the presence of information on heroin effects and active (e.g., fentanyl) or inert impurities. Influence of prompts on discounting processes and associations among probability-discounting measures, opioid use behaviors, and dependence severity were evaluated. Heroin use likelihood decreased with increased impurity or overdose risk and in a generally orderly fashion. Discounting was greater (i.e., reduced heroin use likelihood) when overdose risk, compared to sample impurity, was manipulated. Less discounting was associated with more severe opioid dependence. Discounting did not differ among prompts for either task. Individuals might adjust their heroin-use behavior to reduce harm with risk-related information. Greater discounting elicited by overdose relative to impurity risk suggests that equating adulteration and overdose risk is essential for harm reduction. Expanded access to drug checking services, which inform impurity and overdose risk, can reduce fatal overdoses. Due to fear of legal sanctions for these services, legislation and judicial decisions should explicitly protect these services.

34505281,2022,Sex differences in the effect of chronic delivery of the buprenorphine analogue BU08028 on heroin relapse and choice in a rat model of opioid maintenance.,"Maintenance treatment with opioid agonists (buprenorphine, methadone) decreases opioid use and relapse. We recently modelled maintenance treatment in rats and found that chronic delivery of buprenorphine or the μ opioid receptor partial agonist TRV130 decreased relapse to oxycodone seeking and taking. Here, we tested the buprenorphine analogue BU08028 on different heroin relapse-related measures and heroin versus food choice. For relapse assessment, we trained male and female rats to self-administer heroin (6 h·day-1 , 14 days) in Context A and then implanted osmotic minipumps containing BU08028 (0, 0.03 or 0.1 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 ). Effects of chronic BU08028 delivery were tested on (1) incubation of heroin-seeking in a non-drug Context B, (2) extinction responding reinforced by heroin-associated discrete cues in Context B, (3) reinstatement of heroin-seeking induced by re-exposure to Context A and (4) re-acquisition of heroin self-administration in Context A. For choice assessment, we tested the effect of chronic BU08028 delivery on heroin versus food choice. Chronic BU08028 delivery decreased incubation of heroin seeking. Unexpectedly, BU08028 increased re-acquisition of heroin self-administration selectively in females. Chronic BU08028 had minimal effects on context-induced reinstatement and heroin versus food choice in both sexes. Finally, exploratory post hoc analyses suggest that BU08028 decreased extinction responding selectively in males. Chronic BU08028 delivery had both beneficial and detrimental, sex-dependent, effects on different triggers of heroin relapse and minimal effects on heroin choice in both sexes. Results suggest that BU08028 would not be an effective opioid maintenance treatment in humans.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Buprenorphine;Craving;Cues;Extinction, Psychological;Female;Food;Heroin;Humans;Maintenance;Male;Measures;Methadone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Rats;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Recurrence;Relapse;Self;Self Administration;Sex;Sex Characteristics;Therapeutics",Recurrence;Relapse,Br J Pharmacol,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
34666879,2022,Past-year use or misuse of an opioid is associated with use of a sedative-hypnotic medication: a US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) study.,"Prescription use and misuse of opioids are linked to greater sleep disturbance. However, there are limited data on the prevalence of sedative-hypnotic medication use among persons who use opioids. Therefore, this study examined whether past-year sedative-hypnotic use among persons who used/misused opioids was higher than among individuals who did not use opioids. Data were acquired from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 2015-2018. Use of a sedative benzodiazepine (temazepam, flurazepam, triazolam) or a Z-drug (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) was examined in relation to use/misuse of an opioid within the past year. Logistic regression models estimated the associations between opioids and sedative-hypnotics using inverse probability of treatment weighting. A secondary machine learning analysis tested 6 binary classifiers to predict sedative-hypnotic use based on opioid use/misuse and other covariates. Of 171,766 respondents, 24% used a prescription opioid whereas 3.6% misused an opioid in the past year. Among those who used a prescription opioid, 1.9% received a sedative benzodiazepine and 9% received a Z-drug during the same time frame. Use of an opioid was associated with greater odds of sedative benzodiazepine use (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.61-5.4) and Z-drug use (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.51-4.09), and stronger associations were noted for misuse of an opioid. Machine learning models accurately classified sedative-hypnotic medication use for &gt; 70% of respondents based on opioid use/misuse. Sedative-hypnotic use is common among persons who use opioids, which is of concern given the elevated mortality risk with concurrent use of these substances.

34816821,2022,Evidence of Buprenorphine-precipitated Withdrawal in Persons Who Use Fentanyl.,"Buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent persons with recent fentanyl use. However, the prevalence of this phenomenon is not clinically established. We sought to evaluate the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl. We collected self-report data on opioid withdrawal symptoms after buprenorphine use, and, as a comparator, after methadone use, in 1679 individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder across 49 addiction treatment centers in the United States. The odds of developing severe withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine within 24 hours after fentanyl use (OR = 5.202, 95% CI = 1.979-13.675, P = 0.001), and within 24 to 48hours after fentanyl use (OR = 3.352, 95% CI =1.237-9.089, P = 0.017). As expected, patients did not report significantly higher rates of withdrawal when taking methadone after fentanyl use. Of those who waited less than 24hours after fentanyl before using buprenorphine or methadone, 22.19% (n = 152 of 685) and 11.56% (n = 23 of 199), respectively, reported severe opioid withdrawal. This study supports previous anecdotal reports of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal from fentanyl. The odds of withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine after recent (within 48 hours) fentanyl use, however, this relationship was not observed in persons taking methadone, suggesting that this effect is specific to buprenorphine. Further research is urgently needed to describe the pharmacokinetics of non-medical fentanyl use to improve buprenorphine inductions strategies.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Fentanyl;Humans;Incidence;Methadone;Narcotics;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmacokinetics;Prevalence;Report;Research;Self Report;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States;Withdrawal Symptoms",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Withdrawal Symptoms,J Addict Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
34871638,2022,Latent trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults in early treatment for nonmedical opioid use.,"Understanding the course of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment may inform efforts to promote positive early treatment response and reduce treatment attrition. Persons in treatment for nonmedical opioid use were identified from 86 addiction treatment facilities. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms during the first month of treatment among individuals who screened positive for depression (N = 3016) and/or anxiety (N = 2779) at intake. A three-class solution best fit the data for anxiety symptoms and included the following trajectories: (1) persistent moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms, (2) remitting severe anxiety symptoms, and (3) persistent minimal-to-mild anxiety symptoms. Similarly, a three-class solution best fit the data for depressive symptoms and included trajectories characterized by (1) persistent moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, (2) persistent moderate depressive symptoms, and (3) mild/remitting depressive symptoms. Persistent moderate-to-severe anxiety and depressive symptoms were predicted by female gender and heavy past-month benzodiazepine co-use. Fine grained-information about substance use was not collected. Results may not be generalizable to individuals receiving treatment outside of specialty addiction clinics. Analysis of anxiety and depression symptom trajectories in early treatment suggest that a subset of individuals entering treatment for opioid use experienced persistent and significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas others experience a remission of symptoms. Interventions designed to target individuals at the greatest risk, such as women and individuals reporting opioid/benzodiazepine co-use, may help improve mental health symptoms in early OUD treatment.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Benzodiazepine;Comprehension;Depression;Depressive Symptoms;Female;Gender;Growth;Humans;Male;Mental Health;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Risk;Sex Characteristics;Solutions;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Women",Anxiety Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,J Affect Disord,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
34895472,2022,Slow conformational dynamics of the human A2A adenosine receptor are temporally ordered.,"A more complete depiction of protein energy landscapes includes the identification of different function-related conformational states and the determination of the pathways connecting them. We used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging to investigate the conformational dynamics of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), at the single-molecule level. Slow, reversible conformational exchange was observed among three different fluorescence emission states populated for agonist-bound A2AAR. Transitions among these states predominantly occurred in a specific order, and exchange between inactive and active-like conformations proceeded through an intermediate state. Models derived from molecular dynamics simulations with available A2AAR structures rationalized the relative fluorescence emission intensities for the highest and lowest emission states but not the transition state. This suggests that the functionally critical intermediate state required to achieve activation is not currently visualized among available A2AAR structures.","Biophysics;Fluorescence;Fluorescence Spectroscopy;Humans;Lipids;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Proteins;Receptor, Adenosine A2A;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;Receptors, Purinergic P1;Relatives",,Structure,Medication Development for OUD;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
34971694,2022,Evolution of drug delivery systems: From 1950 to 2020 and beyond.,"Modern drug delivery technology began in 1952 with the advent of the Spansule® sustained-release capsule technology, which can deliver a drug for 12 h after oral administration through an initial immediate dose followed by the remaining released gradually. Until the 1980s, oral and transdermal formulations providing therapeutic durations up to 24 h for small molecules dominated the drug delivery field and the market. The introduction of Lupron Depot® in 1989 opened the door for long-acting injectables and implantables, extending the drug delivery duration from days to months and occasionally years. Notably, the new technologies allowed long-term delivery of peptide and protein drugs, although limited to parenteral administration. The introduction of the first PEGylated protein, Adagen®, in 1990 marked the new era of PEGylation, resulting in Doxil® (doxorubicin in PEGylated liposome) in 1995, Movantik® (PEGylated naloxone - naloxegol) in 2014, and Onpattro® (Patisiran - siRNA in PEGylated lipid nanoparticle) in 2018. Drug-polymer complexes were introduced, e.g., InFed® (iron-dextran complex injection) in 1974 and Abraxane® (paclitaxel-albumin complex) in 2005. In 2000, both Mylotarg™ (antibody-drug conjugate - gemtuzumab ozogamicin) and Rapamune® (sirolimus nanocrystal formulation) were introduced. The year 2000 also marked the launching of the National Nanotechnology Initiative by the U.S. government, which was soon followed by the rest of the world. Extensive work on nanomedicine, particularly formulations designed to escape from endosomes after being taken by tumor cells, along with PEGylation technology, ultimately resulted in the timely development of lipid nanoparticle formulations for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in 2020. While the advances in drug delivery technologies for the last seven decades are breathtaking, they are only the tip of an iceberg of technologies that have yet to be utilized in an approved formulation or even to be discovered. As life expectancy continues to increase, more people require long-term care for various diseases. Filling the current and future unmet needs requires innovative drug delivery technologies to overcome age-old familiar hurdles, e.g., improving water-solubility of poorly soluble drugs, overcoming biological barriers, and developing more efficient long-acting depot formulations. The lessons learned from the past are essential assets for developing future drug delivery technologies implemented into products. As the development of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated, meeting the unforeseen crisis of the uncertain future requires continuous cumulation of failures (as learning experiences), knowledge, and technologies. Conscious efforts of supporting diversified research topics in the drug delivery field are urgently needed more than ever.","Abraxane;Administration;Administration, Oral;Albumins;Antibody-Drug Conjugates;Biopharmaceuticals;COVID-19;COVID-19 Vaccines;Capsules;Cells;Disease;Doxorubicin;Drug Delivery Systems;Endosomes;Future;Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin;Government;History;Humans;Icebergs;InFed;Injectables;Injections;Iron-Dextran Complex;Knowledge;Learning;Life Expectancy;Lipids;Liposomes;Long-Term Care;Lupron;Mylotarg;Naloxone;Nanocrystalline Materials;Nanomedicine;Nanoparticles;Nanotechnology;Needs;Neoplasms;News;Paclitaxel;Peptides;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Polymers;Proteins;RNA, Small Interfering;Rapamune;Research;Rest;SARS-CoV-2;Sirolimus;Solubility;Spansule;Technology;Therapeutics;Water;Work",COVID-19;Neoplasms,J Control Release,Medication Development for OUD;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
35328429,2022,"Exploring Pharmacological Functions of Alternatively Spliced Variants of the Mu Opioid Receptor Gene, Oprm1, via Gene-Targeted Animal Models.","The mu opioid receptor has a distinct place in the opioid receptor family, since it mediates the actions of most opioids used clinically (e.g., morphine and fentanyl), as well as drugs of abuse (e.g., heroin). The single-copy mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, goes through extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate numerous splice variants that are conserved from rodents to humans. These OPRM1 splice variants can be classified into three structurally distinct types: (1) full-length 7 transmembrane (TM) carboxyl (C)-terminal variants; (2) truncated 6TM variants; and (3) single TM variants. Distinct pharmacological functions of these splice variants have been demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly by using several unique gene-targeted mouse models. These studies provide new insights into our understanding of the complex actions of mu opioids with regard to OPRM1 alternative splicing. This review provides an overview of the studies that used these gene-targeted mouse models for exploring the functional importance of Oprm1 splice variants.","Alternative Splicing;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Comprehension;Family;Fentanyl;Gene Targeting;Genes;Heroin;Humans;In Vitro;Mice;Models, Animal;Morphine;News;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;RNA, Messenger, Precursors;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, mu;Review;Rodentia",,Int J Mol Sci,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
35341563,2022,Interactions between opioids and stimulants: Behavioral pharmacology of abuse-related effects.,"Opioid abuse continues to be a significant public health challenge, with rates of opioid-related overdose deaths increasing continuously over the last two decades. There also has been a sharp increase in overdose deaths involving stimulant drugs, primarily cocaine and methamphetamine. Recent estimates indicate a high prevalence of co-use of opioids and stimulants, which is a particularly complex problem. Behavioral pharmacology research over the last few decades has characterized interactions between opioids and stimulants as well as evaluated potential treatments. This chapter describes interactions between opioids and stimulants, with a focus on pre-clinical studies of abuse-related behavioral effects using self-administration, reinstatement, drug discrimination, place conditioning, and intracranial self-stimulation paradigms in laboratory animals. In general, the literature provides substantial evidence of mutual enhancement between opioids and stimulants for abuse-related effects, although such results are not ubiquitous. Enhanced abuse-related effects could manifest in many ways including engaging in drug seeking and taking behaviors with greater persistence, effort, and motivation and/or increased likelihood of relapse. Moreover, studies on opioid/stimulant combinations set the stage for evaluating potential treatments for polysubstance use. Behavioral pharmacology research has proven invaluable for elucidating these relationships using rigorous experimental designs and quantitative analyses of pharmacological and behavioral data.","Analgesics, Opioid;Animals, Laboratory;Behavior;Central Nervous System Stimulants;Clinical Study;Cocaine;Death;Drug Abuse;Drug Interactions;Drug Overdose;Experimental Design;Humans;Literature;Methamphetamine;Motivation;Opioid Abuse;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Prevalence;Problem Behavior;Public Health;Relapse;Research;Self Administration;Self Stimulation;Therapeutics",Death;Drug Abuse;Drug Overdose;Opioid Abuse;Relapse,Adv Pharmacol,Medication Development for OUD;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
35556770,2022,Mitragynine Reverses Paclitaxel Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy and is Mediated via Opioid Receptor Involvement.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a problematic side effect in patients receiving chemotherapeutic cancer treatments. Clinical use of approved analgesic drugs often does not adequately control the pathological pain arising from CIPN and does not account for potential abuse with opioid therapeutics. Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) contains the alkaloid mitragynine, which exhibits analgesic properties. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms that underlie these analgesic properties are complex and not completely understood. Male and female C57bl/6 mice received 8 mg/kg intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel, a taxane class chemotherapeutic, every other day over the course of 7 days. To confirm the development of CIPN, the von Frey assay was utilized to determine the onset mechanical allodynia, which arises when a previously non-painful stimulus is perceived as painful. Intraperitoneal mitragynine and the prototypical opioid agonist morphine both dose-relatedly reversed CIPN-induced mechanical allodynia. Effective doses (ED)50 were as follows - morphine: 7.02 (6.56 - 7.51) mg/kg, mitragynine: 109.80 (104.27 - 115.62) mg/kg. Pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone 0.032 mg/kg, intraperitoneally produced a rightward shift in both morphine and mitragynine dose-response curves. Effective doses (ED)50 were as follows - naltrexone + morphine: 27.93 (24.84 - 31.40), naltrexone + mitragynine: 245.41 (211.76 - 284.39), resulting in a 3.98 and 2.24 fold shift of dose response curves, respectively. Here we show that mitragynine reverses mechanical allodynia associated with paclitaxel CIPN. We also show that opioid receptors mediate such activity, though additional data suggest a role for adrenergic and serotonin receptors as well. Mitragynine may be an effective analgesic treatment option for patients experiencing painful CIPN.","Adrenergic Agents;Alkaloids;Analgesics;Cancer;Drug Therapy;Exhibition;Female;Injections, Intraperitoneal;Male;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Mitragyna speciosa;Morphine Derivatives;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioids;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Serotonin;Role;Taxanes;Therapeutics",Cancer;Mechanical Allodynia;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,FASEB J,Medication Development for OUD;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
35636070,2022,Patient perceptions of higher-dose naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose.,"Higher-dose formulations of naloxone were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid overdose. These products were developed based on projected saturation of high-potency fentanyl analogues in the illicit marketplace although the evidence base for their necessity is still under scrutiny. Concern has been raised that unintended reductions in patient acceptance of naloxone may occur due to increased precipitated withdrawal risk associated with higher naloxone doses. A well-founded and time-sensitive call for representation of people who use drugs in this decision-making process has been made. This study provides the first data on patient perceptions of higher-dose formulations to inform this scientific debate and distribution efforts. Patients (N=1152) entering treatment for opioid use disorder at one of 49 addiction treatment facilities located across the United States completed a preference assessment of naloxone nasal spray formulations. Patients selected a formulation preference across three scenarios (administration for self, administration to others, community responder administration). A majority of respondents that had been administered naloxone previously reported that their most recent overdose reversal included two or more naloxone administrations (59.9%). Most respondents either had no preference (48.4%) or preferred a higher-dose formulation (35.9%) if personally experiencing an overdose. Similar preference distributions were observed for administration to others and by community responders. Relative to standard-dose preference, respondents preferring higher-dose formulations had a greater odds of recent suspected fentanyl exposure. These data inform patients, advocates, and policy-makers considering distribution and utilization of naloxone formulations by reporting perspectives of patients with opioid use and overdose experience. Limited evidence for widespread avoidance of higher-dose formulations was found. As real-world evidence of acceptability and effectiveness emerges, either supporting or refuting the widespread need for higher-dose naloxone formulations, it is the responsibility of the scientific and public health community to be responsive to those data.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Community;Decision Making;Drug Overdose;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Humans;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Nasal Sprays;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Perception;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy Makers;Public Health;Relatives;Respondents;Risk;Self Administration;Standards;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
36001419,2022,Cortical thickness and related depressive symptoms in early abstinence from chronic methamphetamine use.,"Methamphetamine use is surging globally as a cause of morbidity and mortality. Treatment is typically sought in early abstinence, when craving and depressive symptoms are intense, contributing to relapse and poor outcomes. To advance an understanding of this problem and identify therapeutic targets, we conducted a retrospective analysis of brain structure in 89 adults with Methamphetamine Use Disorder who were in early abstinence and 89 healthy controls. Unlike most prior research, the participants did not significantly differ in age, sex and recent use of alcohol and tobacco (p-values ≥ 0.400). We analysed thickness across the entire cerebral cortex by fitting a general linear model to identify differences between groups. Follow-up regressions were performed to determine whether cortical thickness in regions showing group differences was related to craving, measured on a visual analogue scale, or to the Beck Depression Inventory score. Participants in early methamphetamine abstinence (M ± SD = 22.1 ± 25.6 days) exhibited thinner cortex in clusters within bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal, insular, and right cingulate cortices relative to controls (p-values &lt; 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons). Unlike craving (β = 0.007, p = 0.947), depressive symptoms were positively correlated with cortical thickness across clusters (β = 0.239, p = 0.030) and with thickness in the anterior cingulate cluster (β = 0.246, p = 0.027) in the methamphetamine-dependent group. Inasmuch as anterior cingulate pathology predicts response to antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder, cingulate structure may also identify patients with Methamphetamine Use Disorder who can benefit from antidepressant medication.","Adult;Alcohols;Anterior Cingulate Cortex;Antidepressive Agents;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Comprehension;Craving;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Symptoms;Gray Matter;Humans;Inventories;Linear Models;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Methamphetamine;Morbidity;Mortality;Pathology;Patients;Relapse;Relatives;Research;Retrospective Studies;Sex;Therapeutics;Tobacco;Visual Analog Scale","Depressive Disorder, Major;Relapse",Addict Biol,Medication Development for OUD;Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
36126611,2022,The association of chronic pain and opioid withdrawal in men and women with opioid use disorder.,"Approximately 2.7 million individuals in the United States had an opioid use disorder (OUD) in 2020. Chronic pain may exacerbate opioid withdrawal severity, yet most research on opioid withdrawal has not collected data on chronic pain status. Moreover, there is limited evidence that women tend to experience greater opioid withdrawal severity than men, but large, confirmatory studies on this topic have not been published. The goal of this study was to examine the roles of chronic pain and gender on opioid withdrawal severity using a large, multi-site database. Data were collected from N = 1252 individuals with OUD entering eight residential addiction treatment facilities. Demographic, drug use behaviors, and chronic pain status were collected at treatment intake, and self-reported opioid withdrawal and craving were measured at intake and 1-3 days, 4-6 days, and 7-9 days after intake. Regression analyses were used to predict withdrawal and craving severity at intake and across the four timepoints. At intake, withdrawal was higher in persons who were older, had greater SUD severity, women, had chronic pain, and used &gt; 1 substance (p-values ≤.007) and craving was higher in persons with greater SUD severity (p &lt; .001) and women (p = .033). Withdrawal remained higher in women and persons with chronic pain across timepoints but decreased at a similar rate relative to comparators. Women and persons with chronic pain would benefit from earlier engagement in treatment and may require a more intensive strategy to mitigate opioid withdrawal in early treatment.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Behavior;Chronic Pain;Craving;Database;Demography;Female;Gender;Goals;Humans;Male;Men;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Regression Analysis;Relatives;Research;Residential Treatment;Role;Self;Substance P;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Therapeutics;United States;Women",Chronic Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome,Drug Alcohol Depend,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
36145618,2022,Nose-to-Brain Delivery of Therapeutic Peptides as Nasal Aerosols.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as psychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic pain, stroke, brain tumor, spinal cord injury, and many other CNS diseases, would hugely benefit from specific and potent peptide pharmaceuticals and their low inherent toxicity. The delivery of peptides to the brain is challenging due to their low metabolic stability, which decreases their duration of action, poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and their incompatibility with oral administration, typically resulting in the need for parenteral administration. These challenges limit peptides' clinical application and explain the interest in alternative routes of peptide administration, particularly nose-to-brain (N-to-B) delivery, which allows protein and peptide drugs to reach the brain noninvasively. N-to-B delivery can be a convenient method for rapidly targeting the CNS, bypassing the BBB, and minimizing systemic exposure; the olfactory and trigeminal nerves provide a unique pathway to the brain and the external environment.

Literature suggests that the two are reciprocally related and both may be associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. However, the relationships among musculoskeletal pain, sleep duration, and CRP remain unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the relationship between acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, sleep, and inflammation using the data from the initial visit of the UK Biobank. 17,642 individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, 11,962 individuals with acute musculoskeletal pain, and 29,604 pain-free controls were included in the analysis. In addition, we validated the findings using data from the second visit assessment of the UK Biobank. We found that 1) chronic pain was associated with higher CRP levels compared to both acute pain and the pain-free controls; 2) chronic pain was associated with a lower sleep score (a measurement of sleep patterns), compared to acute pain and the pain-free controls; and acute pain was associated with lower sleep scores compared to the controls; 3) there was a significant negative association between the sleep score and CRP; 4) CRP may partially mediate the association between chronic pain and decreased sleep score. However, the effect size of the mediation was rather small, and the pathophysiological significance remains uncertain. Further validation is needed. These findings were partly replicated in the UK Biobank second visit assessment cohort with a smaller sample size. Our findings, which are based on the large UK Biobank dataset, support the interplay between musculoskeletal pain, sleep patterns, and the potential mediating role of CRP on this reciprocal relationship.",Acute Pain;Association;Biological Specimen Banks;C-Reactive Protein;Chronic Pain;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dataset;Health;Humans;Inflammation;Literature;Mediating;Musculoskeletal Pain;Negotiating;Pain;Role;Sample Size;Sleep;United Kingdom,Acute Pain;Chronic Pain;Inflammation;Musculoskeletal Pain;Pain,Sleep Med,Novel Therapeutic Options for Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose,Not,Focused Medications Development to Treat Opioid Use Disorder and Prevent/Reverse
32768993,2020,The relationship between insomnia and the intensity of drinking in treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol dependence.,"Although insomnia is highly prevalent in alcohol use disorders(AUD), its associations with the severity of alcohol use, pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities and psychosocial problems are understudied. The present study evaluates the interplay between these factors using a structural equation model (SEM). We assessed baseline cross-sectional data on patients with AUD (N = 123) recruited to a placebo-controlled medication trial. Severity of alcohol use was measured by the Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (B-MAST). Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess insomnia symptoms. The Hamilton scales for Depression and Anxiety, Short Index of Problems and Timeline Follow Back evaluated psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial consequences of drinking and level of alcohol consumption respectively. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between insomnia and severity of alcohol use while controlling for covariates. We constructed a SEM with observed variables to delineate the effect of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial factors and current alcohol use on the pathway between alcohol use severity and insomnia. The sample was predominately male(83.9 %), Black(54.6 %) and employed(60.0 %). About 45 % of the participants reported moderate-severe insomnia.The association between insomnia and B-MAST attenuated after adjustment for demographics, psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial problems(OR[95 % CI] = 1.17(0.99-1.47). SEM findings demonstrated that B-MAST and insomnia were linked to psychiatric symptoms (95 % Asymptotic-Confidence Interval (ACI): 0.015-0.159, p &lt; 0.05) but not to psychosocial problems or current alcohol use. Among treatment-seeking patients with AUD, psychiatric burden mediated the relationship between severity of alcohol use and insomnia.

34199582,2021,Patient Experiences with the Transition to Telephone Counseling during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: To identify and document the treatment experiences among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the context of the rapid move from in-person to telephone counseling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants (n = 237) completed a survey with open-ended questions that included the following domains: (1) satisfaction with telephone counseling, (2) perceived convenience, (3) changes to the therapeutic relationship, (4) perceived impact on substance use recovery, and (5) general feedback. Responses were coded using thematic analysis. Codes were subsequently organized into themes and subthemes (covering 98% of responses). Interrater reliability for coding of participants' responses ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Results: Overall, patients reported that telephone counseling improved the therapeutic experience. Specifically, 74% of respondents were coded as providing responses consistently indicating ""positive valency"". ""Positive valency"" responses include: (1) feeling supported, (2) greater comfort and privacy, (3) increased access to counselors, and (4) resolved transportation barriers. Conversely, ""negative valency"" responses include: (1) impersonal experience and (2) reduced privacy. Conclusions: Telephone counseling presents its own set of challenges that should be investigated further to improve the quality of care and long-term patient outcomes.",COVID-19 Pandemic;Coding;Counseling;Counselors;Feedback;Feelings;Methods;Needs Assessment;Opioid Use Disorder;Overall;Patients;Persons;Privacy;Quality of Health Care;Respondents;Satisfaction;Substance Use;Surveys;Telehealth;Telephone;Therapeutics;Transportation,COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use,Healthcare (Basel),Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,HEAL Data Eco-systemJustice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
34200312,2021,Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Service Provision and Telephone Counseling: A Concurrent Mixed-Methods Approach.,"Using quantitative and qualitative evidence, this study triangulates counselors' perspectives on the use of telemedicine in the context of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment. A concurrent mixed-methods design examined counselors' experiences with telephone counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. N = 42 counselors who provided OUD counseling services completed a close-ended, quantitative survey examining their experiences in addressing clients' anxiety, depression, anger, substance use, therapeutic relationship, and substance use recovery using telephone counseling. The survey also assessed comfort, convenience, and satisfaction with telephone counseling. Counselors also completed open-ended responses examining satisfaction, convenience, relationship with patients, substance use, and general feedback with telephone counseling. The synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence indicated that a majority of counselors had positive experiences with using telephone counseling to provide services to clients undergoing OUD treatment. Convenience, greater access to clients, and flexibility were among the reasons cited for their positive experience. However, counselors also expressed that the telephone counseling was impersonal, and that some clients may have difficulties accessing appropriate technology for telehealth adoption. Findings suggest that further research with counselors is needed to identify the key elements of an effective integration of telephone counseling with traditional in-person treatment approaches in the post-pandemic era.",Adoption;Anger;Anxiety;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Clients;Counseling;Counselors;Depression;Elements;Feedback;Humans;Methods;Needs Assessment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Patients;Persons;Pliability;Research;SARS-CoV-2;Satisfaction;Substance Use;Surveys;Technology;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Telephone;Therapeutics,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,HEAL Data Eco-systemJustice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
35279358,2022,Barriers and poor telephone counseling experiences among patients receiving medication for opioid use disorders.,"The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the relaxation of regulations surrounding Medication for Opioid Use Disorders (MOUD) treatment, including a shift from in-person to telehealth counseling services adjunct to MOUD treatment. We examine how patient-level barriers impact their counseling experiences. We examine data from n = 264 participants who completed a cross-sectional survey regarding their experiences with telephone counseling adjunct to MOUD between July to November 2020. Variables examined include: convenience and satisfaction with telephone counseling, comfort and change in relationship with counselor, and how telephone counseling helped with anxiety, depression, anger, substance use, and recovery. Participants also listed the barriers they faced when using telephone counseling. Thirty-one percent of the sample (n = 81) reported experiencing one or more barriers to telephone counseling. Satisfaction with counseling, perceived convenience, comfort, and beneficial effects of counseling on substance use were associated with increased odds of reporting no barriers (range of p.038 to &lt;0.001). Many participants reported barriers to telehealth counseling, and these barriers were in turn associated with poorer counseling experiences. Many treatment providers plan to integrate telehealth service provision in their healthcare delivery model, but more research on patient-level barriers and its impact on treatment is needed.",Anger;Anxiety;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Counseling;Counselors;Cross-Sectional Studies;Delivery of Health Care;Depression;Humans;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pandemics;Patients;Persons;Regulation;Relaxation;Research;Satisfaction;Substance Use;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Telephone;Therapeutics,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Patient Educ Couns,Cross-Cutting Projects;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,HEAL Data Eco-systemJustice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
34118490,2021,Individuals with recurrent low back pain exhibit further altered frontal plane trunk control in remission than when in pain.,"Movement alterations due to low back pain (LBP) could lead to long-term adverse consequences if they do not resolve after symptoms subside. This study aims to determine if altered trunk control associated with recurrent low back pain persists beyond symptom duration. Twenty young adults with recurrent LBP were tested once during an LBP episode and once in symptom remission, and twenty matched back-healthy participants served as controls. Participants walked on a treadmill with five prescribed step widths (0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67 × preferred step width). Motion capture and surface electromyography were used to record trunk kinematics and muscle activation. Thorax-pelvis coordination was calculated using vector coding, and longissimus activation and co-activation were analyzed. Young adults with recurrent LBP exhibited a ""looser"" trunk control strategy in the frontal plane during gait that was persistent regardless of pain status across multiple step widths compared to controls. The looser trunk control was demonstrated by a greater pelvis-only, less thorax-only coordination pattern, and decreased bilateral longissimus co-activation in individuals with recurrent LBP compared to controls. The looser trunk control strategy was further amplified when individuals were in symptom remission and exhibited greater trunk excursion and reduced in-phase coordination in the frontal plane. The amplification of aberrant movement during symptom remission may suggest that movement patterns or anatomical factors existing prior to the tested painful episode underlie altered trunk control in individuals with recurrent LBP. The symptom remission period of recurrent LBP may be a critical window into clinical evaluation and treatment.","Back;Biomechanical Phenomena;Coding;Electromyography;Exhibition;Gait;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Kinematics;Lead;Low Back Pain;Low Back Pain, Recurrent;Motion;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscles;Pain;Pelvis;Records;Surface Electromyography;Therapeutics;Thorax;Torso;Walking;Young Adult","Low Back Pain;Low Back Pain, Recurrent;Pain","Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)",Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,HEAL Studies to Enhance Phenotyping of Study Participants with Chronic Overlappi
34571486,2021,Evidence for increased neuromuscular drive following spinal manipulation in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome.,"Thoracic spinal manipulation can improve pain and function in individuals with shoulder pain; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of thoracic spinal manipulation on muscle activity, as alteration in muscle activity is a key impairment for those with shoulder pain. We also evaluated the relationship between changes in muscle activity and clinical outcomes, to characterize the meaningful context of a change in neuromuscular drive. Participants with shoulder pain related to subacromial pain syndrome (n = 28) received thoracic manipulation of low amplitude high velocity thrusts to the lower, middle and upper thoracic spine. Electromyographic muscle activity (trapezius-upper, middle, lower; serratus anterior; deltoid; infraspinatus) and shoulder pain (11-point scale) was collected pre and post-manipulation during arm elevation, and normalized to a reference contraction. Clinical benefits were assessed using the Pennsylvania Shoulder Score (Penn) at baseline and 2-3 days post-intervention. A significant increase in muscle activity was observed during arm ascent (p = 0.002). Using backward stepwise regression analysis, a specific increase in the serratus anterior muscle activity during arm elevation explained improved Penn scores following post-manipulation (p &lt; 0.05). Thoracic spinal manipulation immediately increases neuromuscular drive. In addition, increased serratus anterior muscle activity, a key muscle for scapular motion, is associated with short-term improvements in shoulder clinical outcomes.","Arm;Biomechanical Phenomena;Drive;Electromyography;Humans;Infraspinatus;Manipulation, Spinal;Motion;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscles;Pain;Pennsylvania;Regression Analysis;Scales;Scapula;Shoulder;Shoulder Impingement Syndrome;Shoulder Pain;Spine;Superficial Back Muscles;Syndrome;Trapezius",Pain;Shoulder Impingement Syndrome;Shoulder Pain;Syndrome,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)",Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,HEAL Studies to Enhance Phenotyping of Study Participants with Chronic Overlappi
34958820,2022,Analytic consistency and neural correlates of peak alpha frequency in the study of pain.,"Several studies have found evidence of reduced resting-state peak alpha frequency (PAF) in populations with pain. However, the stability of PAF from different analytic pipelines used to study pain has not been determined and underlying neural correlates of PAF have not been validated in humans. For the first time we compare analytic pipelines and the relationship of PAF to activity in the whole brain and thalamus, a hypothesized generator of PAF. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data and subsequently 64 channel resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) from 47 healthy men, controls from an ongoing study of chronic prostatitis (a pain condition affecting men). We identified important variations in EEG processing for PAF from a review of 17 papers investigating the relationship between pain and PAF. We tested three progressively complex pre-processing pipelines and varied four postprocessing variables (epoch length, alpha band, calculation method, and region-of-interest [ROI]) that were inconsistent across the literature. We found a single principal component, well-represented by the average PAF across all electrodes (grand-average PAF), explained &gt; 95% of the variance across participants. We also found the grand-average PAF was highly correlated among the pre-processing pipelines and primarily impacted by calculation method and ROI. Across methods, interindividual differences in PAF were correlated with rs-fMRI-estimated activity in the thalamus, insula, cingulate, and sensory cortices. These results suggest PAF is a relatively stable marker with respect to common pre and post-processing methods used in pain research and reflects interindividual differences in thalamic and salience network function.",Biomarkers;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Humans;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Men;Methods;Pain;Pain Measurement;Paper;Population;Prostatitis;Research;Respect;Review;Thalamus;Time;fMRI,Pain;Prostatitis,J Neurosci Methods,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,HEAL Studies to Enhance Phenotyping of Study Participants with Chronic Overlappi
35576002,2022,Impaired Ability to Relax Pelvic Floor Muscles in Men With Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome.,"Excessive pelvic floor muscle activity has been suggested as a source of pain in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Our objective was to determine whether men with CP/CPPS have changes in neural drive that impair their ability to relax pelvic floor muscles. We recruited 90 men (42 with CP/CPPS and 48 in the control group [without a history of pelvic pain]). All completed the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). We quantified the ability to relax by comparing resting pelvic floor muscle activity under 2 conditions: a ""rest-only"" condition, in which participants were instructed to simply relax, and a ""rest-between-contraction"" condition, in which participants were instructed to rest for several seconds between voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions. We used multivariate mixed-effects models to examine differences between the groups (men with CP/CPPS and men in the control group) as well as the effect of 6 symptoms captured by the NIH-CPSI: pain related to location (perineum, testicles, penis, suprapubic region) and activity (urination, ejaculation). Men with CP/CPPS were significantly different from men in the control group; men with CP/CPPS had higher resting activity in the rest-between-contraction condition than in the rest-only condition, whereas men in the control group had similar resting activities in both conditions. This effect was strongest in men who reported ejaculation-related pain, which was 70% of the CP/CPPS group. Men without a history of pelvic pain were able to relax their pelvic floor muscles back to baseline after performing voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions. In contrast, men with CP/CPPS, particularly those with ejaculation-related pain, had an impaired ability to relax their pelvic floor muscles. This study may support the investigation of more personalized physical therapist approaches for CP/CPPS that enhance the ability to relax pelvic floor muscles as a mechanism for pain reduction.",Ability;Back Muscles;Chronic Disease;Chronic Pain;Control Groups;Drive;Ejaculation;Electromyography;History;Humans;Index;Male;Men;Muscle Contraction;Muscles;National Institutes of Health (U.S.);Pain;Pelvic Floor;Pelvic Floor Disorders;Pelvic Pain;Penis;Perineum;Physical Therapists;Prostatitis;Rest;Syndrome;Testis;Urination,Chronic Disease;Chronic Pain;Pain;Pelvic Floor Disorders;Pelvic Pain;Prostatitis;Syndrome,Phys Ther,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,HEAL Studies to Enhance Phenotyping of Study Participants with Chronic Overlappi
33518022,2021,Economic Evaluation in Opioid Modeling: Systematic Review.,"The rapid increase in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) over the past 20 years is a complex problem associated with significant economic costs for healthcare systems and society. Simulation models have been developed to capture and identify ways to manage this complexity and to evaluate the potential costs of different strategies to reduce overdoses and OUD. A review of simulation-based economic evaluations is warranted to fully characterize this set of literature. A systematic review of simulation-based economic evaluation (SBEE) studies in opioid research was initiated by searches in PubMed, EMBASE, and EbscoHOST. Extraction of a predefined set of items and a quality assessment were performed for each study. The screening process resulted in 23 SBEE studies ranging by year of publication from 1999 to 2019. Methodological quality of the cost analyses was moderately high. The most frequently evaluated strategies were methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments; the only harm reduction strategy explored was naloxone distribution. These strategies were consistently found to be cost-effective, especially naloxone distribution and methadone maintenance. Prevention strategies were limited to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations. Less than half (39%) of analyses adopted a societal perspective in their estimation of costs and effects from an opioid-related intervention. Prevention strategies and studies' accounting for patient and physician preference, changing costs, or result stratification were largely ignored in these SBEEs. The review shows consistently favorable cost analysis findings for naloxone distribution strategies and opioid agonist treatments and identifies major gaps for future research.","Accounting;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cost;Cost Analysis;Costs and Cost Analysis;Economic Evaluation;Economics;Future;Harm Reduction;Health Care Systems;Humans;Literature;Maintenance;Methadone;Models, Economic;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Physicians;PubMed;Publications;Research;Review;Screening;Societies;Systematic Review;Therapeutics",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Value Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,HEALing Communities

31029914,2019,"Navigating social norms of injection initiation assistance during an overdose crisis: A qualitative study of the perspectives of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada.","Despite the proliferation of fentanyl and fentanyl-adulterated opioids in North America, the impacts of this drug market change on injection initiation processes have not been examined. With the aim of informing structural interventions to address injection initiation and related harms, we explore how people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada understand and navigate social norms of initiating others into injecting within the context of an overdose crisis. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 19 PWID who reported helping someone inject for the first time. Participants were recruited from two cohort studies of PWID. Participants articulated moral dilemmas about assisting others with injecting. While participants described a 'moral code' prohibiting assisting injection-naïve individuals, this code was not the sole consideration shaping social action around injection initiation. Rather, PWID exercised agency about whether and how to assist novice injectors within the context of constraining and enabling social norms around practicing interpersonal responsibility. Changes to the drug market heightened feelings of moral culpability and criminal liability among PWID who assisted others into injection, given that injecting heightened initiates' risk of overdose. These concerns operated in tension with the aim of protecting novice injectors from harms associated with an increasingly potent and unpredictable drug supply by providing them with injection assistance, education and supervision. Our analysis of how PWID practice interpersonal responsibility helps conceptualise how 'moral codes' prohibiting initiation assistance are managed and negotiated amidst structural vulnerability. Structural interventions reducing the vulnerability of novice injectors should be prioritized, including the implementation of supervised injection sites allowing for assisted injection, Good Samaritan laws, and policy changes conducive to a safer drug supply.","Address;Adult;Canada;Cohort Studies;Criminals;Drug Users;Education;Feelings;Female;Fentanyl;Humans;Injections;Interpersonal Relations;Interview;Interview, Psychological;Law;Male;Middle Aged;Morals;North America;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Risk;Risk Reduction Behavior;Social Norms;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Supervision;Supplies;Time","Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Int J Drug Policy,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study
32482954,2021,Language Matters: It Is Time We Change How We Talk About Addiction and its Treatment.,"The way we communicate about addiction, its treatment, and treatment outcomes matters to individuals affected by addiction, their families, and communities. Stigmatizing language can worsen addiction-related stigma and outcomes. Although non-professional terminology may be used by individuals with addiction, the role of clinicians, educators, researchers, policymakers, and community and cultural leaders is to actively work toward destigmatization of addiction and its treatment, in part through the use of non-stigmatizing language. Role-modeling better approaches can help us move away from the inaccurate, outdated view of addiction as a character flaw or moral failing deserving of punishment, and toward that of a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment. Non-stigmatizing, non-judgmental, medically-based terminology and the adoption of person-first language can facilitate improved communication as well as patient access to and engagement with addiction care. Person-first language, which shifts away from defining a person through the lens of disease (eg, the term ""a person with addiction"" is recommended over the terms ""addict"" or ""addicted patient""), implicitly acknowledges that a patient's life extends beyond a given disease. While such linguistic changes may seem subtle, they communicate that addiction, chronic pain and other diseases are only one aspect of a person's health and quality of life, and can promote therapeutic relationships, reduce stigma and health and disparities in addiction care. This article provides examples of stigmatizing terms to be avoided and recommended replacements to facilitate the dialogue about addiction in a more intentional, therapeutic manner.","Adoption;Behavior, Addictive;Character;Chronic Disease;Chronic Pain;Communication;Community;Disease;Family;Health;Humans;Language;Life;Linguistics;Morals;Patients;Persons;Punishment;Quality of Life;Research Personnel;Role;Social Stigma;Terminology;Therapeutics;Time;Treatment Outcome;Work",Chronic Disease;Chronic Pain,J Addict Med,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study
33400442,2021,Prescription Opioid Use and Laboratory Value Derangements: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of NHANES Data.,"The use of opioids for the treatment of pain is a risk versus benefit analysis and metabolic disease is an often overlooked variable in the equation and may lead to increased risk of comorbidities of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes. Our objective was to identify and describe abnormalities among the comprehensive metabolic and lipid panels of individuals taking prescription opioids. We performed a cross-sectional study of the laboratory values with 3 cycles (2011-2016) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in March 2020. NHANES sampling is conducted using a multistaged, stratified, cluster sampling technique to create a representative sample of the United States. We excluded patients with histories of cancer and under the age of 25 years. Our final sample size was 11,061 (n = 162,547,635), with 797 reportedly using a prescription opioid in the past 30 days-a weighted percent representing 22.95% of the US population. Our analyses identified mean differences in biomarkers between individuals taking prescription opioids and the US population. Laboratory values from the comprehensive metabolic panel were all within reference ranges for both groups, with only bilirubin levels being statistically lower in the group currently taking prescription opioids. Values from the lipid panel of both the opioid using and comparison groups were above reference range for total cholesterol and fasting glucose. The opioid using group was also higher than the reference range for triglycerides (mean [M] = 165.4, standard deviation [SD] = 14.2) and insulin (M = 15.5, SD = 2.2), whereas the comparison group was not.  The oral glucose measure was within normal ranges for both groups; however, the opioid using group was 13.7 points higher than the comparison group (M = 122.3, SD = 1.8; M = 108.6, SD = 4.0; P &lt; 0.01). While our study uses a large sample for a robust generalizable analysis it is a correlation study and a longitudinal cohort would provide better evidence linking potential disease states to prescription opioid use. Although all Americans should be alarmed at the lipid levels reported in this study, specific combinations of heightened lipid laboratory values among prescription opioid users accelerate the trajectories toward comorbidities-heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes-leading to diminished quality of life. Therefore pain management and comprehensive drug recovery programs should include nutritional counseling and physical activity as part of their overall treatment plan.","Adult;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Bilirubin;Biomarkers;Blood Glucose;Cancer;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cholesterol;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Correlation Study;Counseling;Cross-Sectional Studies;Disease;Exercise;Fasting;Female;Glucose;Heart Diseases;History;Humans;Insulin;Laboratories;Lead;Lipids;Male;Measures;Metabolic Diseases;Middle Aged;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;Nutrition Surveys;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prescriptions;Program;Quality of Life;Reference Values;Risk;Sample Size;Standards;Therapeutics;Triglycerides;United States",Cancer;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Heart Diseases;Metabolic Diseases;Pain,Pain Physician,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study
34218992,2022,Sex-based differences in psychiatric symptoms and opioid abstinence during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment in adolescents with opioid use disorders.,"Recent studies indicate that sex-based differences exist in co-occurring psychiatric symptoms and disorders among individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD). Whether these associations are present in adolescent samples and change during OUD treatment is poorly understood. In the current study, we examined sex-based differences in psychiatric symptoms and relationships among sex, psychiatric symptoms, and opioid use outcomes in youth with OUD receiving buprenorphine/naloxone (Bup/Nal) and psychosocial treatment. The study randomly assigned one hundred and fifty-two youth (15-21 years old) diagnosed with OUD to either 12 weeks of treatment with Bup/Nal or up to 2 weeks of Bup/Nal detoxification with both treatment arms receiving weekly drug counseling as part of a multisite clinical trial (NIDA-CTN-0010). We compared psychiatric symptoms, assessed via the Youth Self Report (YSR) at baseline and week 12, across male and female OUD participants. The study used logistic regression models to identify sex and psychiatric symptom variables that were predictors of opioid positive urine (OPU) at week 12. Compared to males, females with OUD had higher mean psychiatric symptom scores at baseline across broad-band and narrow-band symptom domains. The study observed significant reductions in psychiatric symptom scores in both males and females during treatment, and by week 12, females only differed from males on anxious-depressive symptom scores. Females, in general, and youth of both sexes presenting to treatment with higher anxious depression scores were less likely to have a week-12 OPU. Clinically significant sex-based differences in psychiatric symptoms are present at baseline among youth with OUD receiving Bup/Nal-assisted treatment and mostly resolve during treatment.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Arm;Association;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Clinical Trial;Counseling;Depression;Depressive Symptoms;Female;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Self Report;Sex;Therapeutics;Urine;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study
34507010,2021,The use of person-centered language in scientific research articles focusing on opioid use disorder.,"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) affects approximately 1% of the population. Despite the prevalence of OUD, it remains a highly stigmatized disorder. Using person-centered language (PCL) - and thereby emphasizing the significance of the person rather than their diagnosis - is a potential strategy to reduce stigma in medical research related to addiction. Thus, we aimed to determine adherence to PCL in OUD-related publications according to the American Medical Association's guidelines. We performed a systematic search for articles published between January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020 using the PubMed database. Articles were randomized and screened until we reached 300 articles that met inclusion criteria. Three-hundred articles were screened to meet this goal. Articles were then screened for non-PCL terms, determined a priori. The majority (240/300; 80 %) of OUD-related publications were not adherent to the AMA guidelines on PCL. Additionally, the use of emotional language (i.e. suffer, afflicted, etc.) was employed in 48 % (145/300) of articles. Stigmatizing terminology was found in 73 % (218/300) of the OUD related articles in this study. Our study demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between senior author affiliation and adherence to reporting guidelines (i.e., PRISMA, STROBE, etc.). A majority of OUD-related publications are not adherent to AMA guidelines on PCL. Language used in these publications is often repeated and replicated in medical education and clinical practice, which directly impacts patient-provider relationships. PCL-adherent language is a tool that both medical researchers and clinicians can use to combat stigma that individuals with OUD may experience.","Affect;American Medical Association;Classification;Database;Diagnosis;Education, Medical;Goals;Guideline;Health Personnel;Humans;Language;Medical Research;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Population;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Prevalence;Professional-Patient Relations;PubMed;Publications;Research;Research Personnel;Social Stigma;Terminology;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,Enhanced Outcomes for Infants and Children Exposed to Opioids,Not,HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study
34890916,2021,Pain catastrophizing and mental health phenotypes in adults with refractory chronic pain: A latent class analysis.,"Chronic pain, pain catastrophizing, and mental health disorders such as anxiety or depression frequently occur together and are challenging to treat. To help understand the relationship between these conditions, we sought to identify distinct phenotypes associated with worse pain and function. In a cohort of people with chronic pain on opioids seeking medical cannabis in New York, we conducted latent class analysis to identify clusters of participants based on pain catastrophizing and mental health symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We then compared clusters with respect to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics using descriptive statistics. Among 185 participants, we identified four discrete groups: low pain catastrophizing and low mental health symptoms (49% of participants), low pain catastrophizing and ADHD-predominant mental health symptoms (11%), high pain catastrophizing and anxiety-predominant mental health symptoms (11%), and high pain catastrophizing and high mental health symptoms (30%). The group with high pain catastrophizing and high mental health symptoms had the worst pain intensity and interference, disability, insomnia, and quality of life, compared to the two groups with lower pain catastrophizing, though not all differences were statistically significant. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying and addressing pain catastrophizing in patients with comorbid chronic pain and mental health symptoms.","Adult;Anxiety;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Chronic Pain;Depression;Latent Class Analysis;Medical Marijuana;Mental Health;New York;Opioids;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain, Intractable;Patients;Persons;Phenotype;Quality of Life;Respect;Sleeplessness;Statistics;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Chronic Pain;Pain;Pain, Intractable;Sleeplessness;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",J Psychiatr Res,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Integrative Management of chronic Pain and OUD for Whole Recovery (IMPOWR)
35142228,2022,Changes in Outpatient Opioid Prescribing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis.,"Changes in health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted opioid prescribing. This study evaluated the impact of restrictions on in-person care on opioid prescribing in the outpatient setting. The hypothesis was that after restrictions to in-person care were implemented, there would be a reduction in the number of chronic and non-chronic opioid prescriptions. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to compare the number of weekly opioid prescriptions between baseline (1/1/2019-3/14/2020), restriction (3/15/2020-6/6/2020), and reopening (6/7/2020-10/31/2020) periods at outpatient practices within a health system in Bronx, NY. Analyses were stratified by prescription type (chronic if the patient had been prescribed opioids for &gt;90 days, or non-chronic). For chronic opioid prescriptions, the week restrictions were implemented, there was an increase in the number of prescriptions compared to what was predicted if there had been no interruption (34.8 prescriptions, 95% CI: 8.0, 61.7). Subsequently, the weekly trend in prescribing was not different in the restriction period or in the reopening period compared to the previous time periods. For non-chronic opioid prescriptions, during the restriction period, the weekly trend in prescribing decreased compared to baseline (-5.0 prescriptions/week, 95% CI: -9.0, -1.0). Subsequently, during the reopening period, the weekly trend in prescribing increased compared to the restriction period (6.4 prescriptions/week, 95% CI: 2.2, 10.7). Despite abrupt restrictions on in-person care, chronic opioid prescriptions did not decrease, which is evidence that providers evolved to meet patient needs. Changes in non-chronic prescriptions are likely related to patients electing not to pursue care for acute pain or challenges with appointment availability.","Acute Pain;Analgesics, Opioid;Appointments;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Delivery of Health Care;Health;Health Services Research;Humans;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Needs;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain Management;Pandemics;Patients;Persons;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;SARS-CoV-2;Time",Acute Pain;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Pain,J Prim Care Community Health,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Integrative Management of chronic Pain and OUD for Whole Recovery (IMPOWR)
35277307,2022,"A cohort study examining the relationship among housing status, patient characteristics, and retention among individuals enrolled in low-barrier-to-treatment-access methadone maintenance treatment.","Few studies have directly compared patient characteristics and retention among those enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) based on housing status. Low-barrier-to-treatment-access programs may be particularly effective at attracting patients experiencing homelessness into MMT; however, the literature on retention in such settings is limited. We performed a retrospective chart review of 488 consecutive patients enrolled from April to October 2017 at low-barrier-to-treatment-access MMT programs in southern New England. Patients completed measures of demographics, social isolation, trauma, chronic pain, smoking behavior, and psychiatric distress. The study investigated associations between housing status and correlates with chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests while controlling the False Discovery Rate. A two-sample log-rank test examined the relationship between retention and housing status. The study further scrutinized this association by regressing retention on all covariates using a Cox proportional hazards model. Forty-six patients (9.4%) reported experiencing homelessness and 442 (90.6%) reported being housed. Thirty-seven percent of patients self-identified as female and 20% as non-white. Compared to patients who were housed, those experiencing homelessness had lower rates of recent employment; higher rates of social isolation, trauma, current chronic pain, and recent cannabis use; and higher overall psychiatric distress (all p &lt; 0.01). At one year, overall retention was 51.8%, and retention was 32.6% in the unhoused group and 53.8% in the housed group. A significant negative association occurred between retention and housing status (p = 0.006). After regressing on all covariates, homelessness was associated with a 69% increase in one-year treatment discontinuation (HR = 1.69 for homelessness, CI = 1.14-2.50). Patients entering MMT experiencing homelessness have multiple clinical vulnerabilities and are at increased risk for 12-month MMT discontinuation.

35787230,2022,A Student Walks into Class … Vignettes to Identify Substance Use Disorder Models of Illness among College Students.,"Illness models, including illness recognition, perceived severity, and perceived nature can affect treatment-seeking behaviors. Vignettes are a leading approach to examine models of illness but are understudied for substance use disorders (SUDs). We created vignettes for multiple common DSM-5 SUDs and assessed SUD illness models among college students. Seven vignettes in which the protagonist meets DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SUDs involving tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, Adderall, cocaine, Vicodin, and heroin were pilot tested and randomly assigned to 216 college students who completed measures related to illness recognition, perceived severity, and perceived nature. MANOVAs with Scheffe post-hoc tests were conducted to examine vignette group differences on models of illness. Vignettes met acceptable levels of clarity and plausibility. Participants characterized the protagonist's substance use as a problem, a SUD, or an addiction most frequently with Vicodin, heroin, and cocaine and least frequently with tobacco and cannabis. Participants assigned to the Vicodin, heroin, and cocaine vignettes were the most likely to view the protagonist's situation as serious and life-threatening, whereas those assigned to the cannabis vignette were the least likely. Numerically more participants characterized the pattern of substance use as a problem (91%) or an addiction (90%) than a SUD (76%), while only 15% characterized it as a chronic medical condition. Illness recognition and perceived severity varied across substances and were lowest for cannabis. Few participants conceptualized SUDs as chronic medical conditions.

36163526,2022,What's in a Name? Terminology Preferences Among Patients Receiving Methadone Treatment.,"Despite recognition of the importance of substance use disorder (SUD) terminology, few studies examine terminology preferences among patients with SUDs. To examine preferences of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) concerning the terminology used by addiction counselors. From January 1, 2019, to February 28, 2020, participants were recruited consecutively from 30-day treatment review sessions at outpatient methadone treatment programs in the Northeastern United States to complete a cross-sectional survey. Participants were English-speaking adult patients with OUD enrolled in methadone treatment. Participants completed 7-point Likert-type scales from 1 (""Strongly Disagree"") to 7 (""Strongly Agree"") to rate their preferences for (a) the presenting problem, (b) collective nouns referring to those with the presenting problem, and (c) personal descriptors. We used univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the associations between demographics (i.e., age, sex, and race) and terminology preferences and ordinal logit regression to explore the association between 12-step program partiality and preference for the term ""addict."" We surveyed 450 patients with mean age of 38.5 (SD = 11.1) years; 59.6% self-identified as male, 77.6% as White, and 12.7% as Hispanic. The highest-rated preferences for presenting problem were ""addiction,"" ""substance use,"" and ""substance abuse."" The highest-rated collective noun terms were ""client,"" ""patient,"" and ""guest."" ""Person with an addiction,"" ""person with substance use disorder,"" and ""substance-dependent person"" were the highest-rated personal descriptors. There were significant differences in terminological preference based on race and age. Twelve-step program partiality was associated with greater preference for the term ""addict"" (F = 21.22, p &lt; .001). Terminology preferences among people receiving methadone treatment aligned with existing guidelines recommending that clinicians use medically accurate and destigmatizing terminology when referring to substance use disorders and the persons who have them.

31082662,2019,"""One guy goes to jail, two people are ready to take his spot"": Perspectives on drug-induced homicide laws among incarcerated individuals.","As overdose deaths have increased in the United States, some lawmakers have explored punitive, ""supply-side"" interventions aimed at reducing the supply of fentanyl. While a rationale of seeking to protect people who use drugs is often given to justify harsh sentences for fentanyl distribution, there is no research to our knowledge on perceptions of the effect of drug-induced homicide laws among people who use drugs. We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 40 people with opioid use disorder (OUD) who were enrolled in a medication for addiction treatment (MAT) program in a unified jail and prison system in Rhode Island on attitudes surrounding increased sentences for distribution of fentanyl, including recently enacted drug-induced homicide laws. Codes were developed using a generalized, inductive method and interviews analyzed in NVivo 12 after being coded by two coders. Most participants stated that drug-induced homicide laws would not be an effective strategy to stem the overdose crisis. We identified key themes, including discussions surrounding the autonomy of people who use drugs, widespread fentanyl prevalence as a barrier to implementation of drug-induced homicide laws, discussions of mass incarceration as ineffective for addressing substance use disorders, feelings that further criminalization could lead to violence, criminalization as a justification for interpersonal loss, and intention as meaningful to categorizing an act as homicide. Findings highlight the importance of centering the experiences of people with OUD in creating policies surrounding the overdose epidemic, potential unintended health consequences of drug-induced homicides laws such as deterrence from calling 911 and increased violence, and how drug-induced homicide laws may undermine advances made in expanding access to OUD treatment for people who are criminal justice-involved.","Adult;Aged;Attitude;Criminal Justice;Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Feelings;Female;Fentanyl;Health;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Homicide;Humans;Intention;Interview;Jails;Knowledge;Law;Lead;Legislation, Drug;Male;Methods;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission;Middle Aged;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Perception;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Prevalence;Prisoners;Prisons;Program;Qualitative Research;Research;Rhode Island;Substance Use Disorders;Supplies;Therapeutics;United States;Violence;Young Adult",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
31492186,2019,Implementing risk stratification to the treatment of adolescent substance use among youth involved in the juvenile justice system: protocol of a hybrid type I trial.,"Youth involved in the juvenile justice system (YIJJ) have high rates of substance use problems; however, rates of YIJJ engagement in substance use services is low. Barriers to service engagement include lack of appropriate screening and connection to services by the juvenile justice system, as well as lack of resources for delivering evidence-based treatment in community-based settings. To address these barriers, this paper describes a protocol for a type 1 hybrid design to (1) implement universal substance use screening for YIJJ; (2) implement and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, three-session substance use interventions based in motivational interviewing for youth with mild/moderate substance use: Teen Intervene (an individual-based intervention); (3) implement ENCOMPASS, an evidence-based substance use intervention based in motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with severe substance use; and (4) evaluate facilitators and barriers to implementing these interventions for mild to severe substance use among YIJJ in community mental health centers (CMHC). Using a hybrid type 1 clinical effectiveness-implementation design, we will collaborate with CMHCs and juvenile justice in two rural Indiana counties. Guided by the EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainability) framework, we will measure factors that affect implementation of substance use screening in juvenile justice and implementation of substance use interventions in CMHCs utilizing self-reports and qualitative interviews with juvenile justice and CMHC staff pre- and post-implementation. YIJJ with mild/moderate substance use will receive a brief interventions and YIJJ with severe substance use will receive ENCOMPASS. We will measure the effectiveness of a brief and comprehensive intervention by assessing changes in substance use across treatment. We anticipate recruiting 160 YIJJ and their caregivers into the study. We will assess intervention outcomes utilizing baseline, 3-, and 6-month assessments. Findings have the potential to improve screening and intervention services for YIJJ.","Address;Adolescent;Affect;Brief Interventions;Caregivers;Clinical Effectiveness;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Community;Community Mental Health Centers;Humans;Hybrids;Indiana;Interview;Justice;Juvenile Delinquency;Measures;Motivational Interviewing;Paper;Program Development;Program Evaluation;Psychotherapy, Brief;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Screening;Self Report;Severity of Illness Index;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Teens;Therapeutics;Youth",Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
31688556,2020,Changes in Medicaid Acceptance by Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities After Implementation of Federal Parity.,"Adequate access for mental illness and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, particularly for Medicaid enrollees, is challenging. Policy efforts, including the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), have targeted expanded access to care. With MHPAEA, more Medicaid plans were required to increase their coverage of SUD treatment, which may impact provider acceptance of Medicaid. To identify changes in Medicaid acceptance by SUD treatment facilities after the implementation of MHPAEA (parity). Observational study using an interrupted time series design. 2002-2013 data from the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) for all SUD treatment facilities was combined with state-level characteristics. Primary outcome is whether a SUD treatment facility reported accepting Medicaid insurance. Implementation of MHPAEA was associated with a 4.6 percentage point increase in the probability of an SUD treatment facility accepting Medicaid (P&lt;0.001), independent of facility and state characteristics, time trends, and key characteristics of state Medicaid programs. After parity, more SUD treatment facilities accepted Medicaid payments, which may ultimately increase access to care for individuals with SUD. The findings underscore how parity laws are critical policy tools for creating contexts that enable historically vulnerable and underserved populations with SUD to access needed health care.","Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare Disparities;Humans;Insurance;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Law;Medicaid;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Observational Study;Parity;Policy;Populations, Underserved;Probability;Program;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Surveys;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Mental Disorders;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Med Care,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
31855783,2020,Childhood adversity and mental health comorbidity in men and women with opioid use disorders.,"To examine gender differences in associations between mental health comorbidity and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among adults with DSM-5 lifetime opioid use disorders (OUD). In 2018, we analyzed 2012-13 nationally-representative data from 388 women and 390 men with OUD (heroin, prescription opioid misuse). Using weighted multinomial logistic regression, we examined factors associated with mental health comorbidity, tested a gender-by-childhood-adversity interaction term, and calculated predicted probabilities, controlling for covariates. Among adults with OUD, women are more likely than men to have comorbid mood or anxiety disorders (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.72 [1.20, 2.48]), and less likely to have conduct disorders. More women than men have prescription OUD (3.72 [2.24, 6.17]), and fewer have heroin use disorder (0.39 [0.27, 0.57]). Among both genders, ACE prevalence is high (&gt;80%) and more than 40% are exposed to ≥3 types of ACE. Women more than men are exposed to childhood sexual abuse (4.22 [2.72, 6.56]) and emotional neglect (1.84 [1.20, 2.81]). Comorbid mood or anxiety disorders are associated with female gender (1.73 [1.18, 2.55]) and exposure to ≥3 types of ACE (3.71 [2.02, 6.85]), controlling for covariates. Moreover, exposure to more ACE elevates risk for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders more among women than men. Among adults with OUD, ACE alters the gender gap in risk for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Using gender-tailored methods to address the harmful effects ACE on the mental health of individuals with OUD may help to prevent and ameliorate the current opioid epidemic.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events;Adverse Childhood Experiences;Aged;Alcohols;Anxiety Disorders;Association;Comorbidity;Conduct Disorder;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Female;Gender;Heroin;Humans;Logistic Regression;Male;Men;Mental Health;Methods;Middle Aged;Mood;Mood Disorders;Odds Ratio;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Personality Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Probability;Risk;Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Sexual Abuse;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Surveys;United States;Women;Young Adult","Anxiety Disorders;Conduct Disorder;Mental Disorders;Mood Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Personality Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Addict Behav,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
32143185,2020,The protective effect of trusted dealers against opioid overdose in the U.S.,"Opioid overdose has become the leading cause of death among adults between 25 and 54 years old in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to explore the social and relational factors that shape the current opioid overdose epidemic. Between January 2016 and February 2017, adults in Providence, Rhode Island, who use opioids were recruited to complete structured survey and semi-structured interview about the social context of their substance use. A total of 92 individuals completed a survey and an interview. Of those, 51 individuals (68.6% male, 49.0% white) discussed their relationships with drug suppliers in their interview and were included in this sub-study. Many of these participants indicated that long-term relationships with trusted dealers represent a key strategy for reducing the risk of substance use-related harm due to suppliers' alleged adoption of consumer protection strategies (e.g. refusing to sell fentanyl) and quality assurance measures (e.g. testing batches of drugs for fentanyl prior to sale). Interpersonal relationships between individuals who use drugs and their suppliers strongly influence the risk and protective factors experienced by people who use drugs in today's opioid overdose epidemic. Evidence-based prevention strategies that are based on an awareness of-or even designed to harness-those positive and/or protective relationships that people who use drugs have already constructed for themselves are likely merited.","Adoption;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Awareness;Cause of Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Female;Fentanyl;Harm Reduction;Humans;Interview;Male;Measures;Middle Aged;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Protective Factors;Rhode Island;Risk;Sales;Social Environment;Social Networks;Substance Use;Surveys;Whites",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Int J Drug Policy,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
33087123,2020,A qualitative study of big data and the opioid epidemic: recommendations for data governance.,"The opioid epidemic has enabled rapid and unsurpassed use of big data on people with opioid use disorder to design initiatives to battle the public health crisis, generally without adequate input from impacted communities. Efforts informed by big data are saving lives, yielding significant benefits. Uses of big data may also undermine public trust in government and cause other unintended harms. We aimed to identify concerns and recommendations regarding how to use big data on opioid use in ethical ways. We conducted focus groups and interviews in 2019 with 39 big data stakeholders (gatekeepers, researchers, patient advocates) who had interest in or knowledge of the Public Health Data Warehouse maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Concerns regarding big data on opioid use are rooted in potential privacy infringements due to linkage of previously distinct data systems, increased profiling and surveillance capabilities, limitless lifespan, and lack of explicit informed consent. Also problematic is the inability of affected groups to control how big data are used, the potential of big data to increase stigmatization and discrimination of those affected despite data anonymization, and uses that ignore or perpetuate biases. Participants support big data processes that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions. Recommendations for ethical big data governance offer ways to narrow the big data divide (e.g., prioritize health equity, set off-limits topics/methods, recognize blind spots), enact shared data governance (e.g., establish community advisory boards), cultivate public trust and earn social license for big data uses (e.g., institute safeguards and other stewardship responsibilities, engage the public, communicate the greater good), and refocus ethical approaches. Using big data to address the opioid epidemic poses ethical concerns which, if unaddressed, may undermine its benefits. Findings can inform guidelines on how to conduct ethical big data governance and in ways that protect and respect patients and society, ensure justice, and foster patient and public trust in public institutions.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Bias;Big Data;Blind Spot;Community;Data Anonymization;Data Systems;Data Warehousing;Ethics;Focus Groups;Government;Guideline;Health Equity;Humans;Informed Consent;Institutes;Interview;Justice;Knowledge;Life Span;Massachusetts;Methods;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Permits;Persons;Privacy;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Research Personnel;Respect;Savings;Societies;Stigmatization;Trust",Opioid Use Disorder,BMC Med Ethics,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
33404337,2020,Perceived Benefits and Harms of Involuntary Civil Commitment for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Involuntary civil commitment (ICC) to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) prevents imminent overdose, but also restricts autonomy and raises other ethical concerns. Using the Kass Public Health Ethics Framework, we identified ICC benefits and harms. Benefits include: protection of vulnerable, underserved patients; reduced legal consequences; resources for families; and ""on-demand"" treatment access. Harms include: stigmatizing and punitive experiences; heightened family conflict and social isolation; eroded patient self-determination; limited or no provision of OUD medications; and long-term overdose risk. To use ICC ethically, it should be recognized as comprising vulnerable patients worthy of added protections; be a last resort option; utilize consensual, humanizing processes; provide medications and other evidence-based-treatment; integrate with existing healthcare systems; and demonstrate effective outcomes before diffusion. ICC to OUD treatment carries significant potential harms that, if unaddressed, may outweigh its benefits.

34013442,2021,Fentanyl-related overdose during incarceration: a comprehensive review.,"Fentanyl and related compounds have recently saturated the illicit drug supply in the United States, leading to unprecedented rates of fatal overdose. Individuals who are incarcerated are particularly vulnerable, as the burden of opioid use disorder is disproportionately higher in this population, and tolerance generally decreases during incarceration. We conduct a systematic search for publications about fentanyl overdoses during incarceration in PubMed and PsycINFO, as well as lay press articles in Google, from January 1, 2013 through March 30th, 2021. Not a single fentanyl overdose was identified in the medical literature, but 90 overdose events, comprising of 76 fatal and 103 nonfatal fentanyl overdoses, were identified in the lay press. Among the 179 overdoses, 138 occurred in jails and 41 occurred in prisons, across the country. Fentanyl-related overdoses are occurring in correctional facilities with unknown but likely increasing frequency. In addition to the need for improved detection and reporting, immediate efforts to 1) increase understanding of the risks of fentanyl and how to prevent and treat overdose among correctional staff and residents, 2) ensure widespread prompt availability of naloxone and 3) expand the availability of medications to treat opioid use disorder for people who are incarcerated will save lives.",Classification;Comprehension;Correctional Facilities;Fentanyl;Illicit Drugs;Jails;Literature;Naloxone;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Persons;Population;Prisons;PubMed;Publications;Review;Risk;Supplies;United States,Opioid Use Disorder,Health Justice,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)

The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) was hypothesized to be an effective strategy to implement and sustain integrated mental health and substance use care in addiction treatment programs. This study examined sustainment of integrated services for up to 2 years after the active implementation phase. The effectiveness of NIATx strategies to implement and sustain integrated services was evaluated by using a cluster-randomized, waitlist control group design. Forty-nine addiction treatment organizations were randomly assigned to either NIATx1 (active implementation strategy) or NIATx2 (waitlist control). The Dual Diagnosis Capability in Addiction Treatment Index was used to evaluate organizations' capability to provide integrated care. The NIATx Stages of Implementation Completion scale was used to assess participation in and adherence to the NIATx implementation process. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to evaluate changes from baseline to end of the sustainment period. Both cohorts sustained their capability to provide integrated treatment services. Both groups achieved successful implementation and sustained integrated services to a similar degree, regardless of sustainment year. Sustainment did not vary as a function of NIATx adherence. The delivery of integrated treatment services was sustained for 2 years after receipt of active implementation support. Future research should consider how contextual factors may predict, mediate, and moderate sustainment outcomes.","Behavior, Addictive;Control Groups;Delivery of Health Care, Integrated;Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry);Future;Gold;Humans;Index;Mental Health;Organizations;Program;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Scales;Standards;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics",Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Psychiatr Serv,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
34410606,2022,Racial Misclassification and Disparities in Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Among American Indians and Alaska Natives.,"Maternal substance misuse can result in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a drug withdrawal process in newborns exposed in utero to drugs. This study aimed to examine the effect of racial misclassification of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) on rates of NAS in two hospital discharge datasets in the Pacific Northwest. We conducted probabilistic record linkages between the Northwest Tribal Registry and Oregon and Washington hospital discharge datasets to correct racial misclassification of AI/AN people. We assessed outcomes using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes. Linkage increased ascertainment of NAS cases among AI/AN by 8.8% in Oregon and by 18.1% in Washington. AI/AN newborns were 1.5 and 3.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with NAS than NHW newborns in Oregon and Washington, respectively. The results showed that newborns residing in rural Washington were 1.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with NAS than those living in urban areas. Correct racial classification is an important factor in improving data quality for AI/AN populations and establishing accurate surveillance to help address the disproportionate burden of neonatal abstinence syndrome among AI/AN. The results highlight the need for programing efforts tailored by insurance status and rurality for pregnant women using substances.","Address;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Classification;Data Quality;Dataset;Diagnosis;Female;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-10-CM;ICD-9-CM;Indians, North American;Infant, Newborn;Insurance Coverage;International Classification of Diseases;Needs;Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome;Oregon;Pacific Northwest;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Records;Registries;Time;United States;Washington",Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
34988462,2021,Improving Medication Access within Integrated Treatment for Individuals with Co-Occurring Disorders in Substance Use Treatment Agencies.,"The best approach to provide comprehensive care for individuals with co-occurring disorders (CODs) related to substance use and mental health is to address both disorders through an integrated treatment approach. However, only 25% of behavioral health agencies offer integrated care and less than 7% of individuals who need integrated treatment receive it. A project used a cluster-randomized waitlist control group design to evaluate the effectiveness of Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) implementation strategies to improve access to addiction and psychotropic medications. This study represents a secondary analysis of data from the NIATx project. Forty-nine agencies were randomized to Cohort1 (active implementation group, receiving the NIATx strategy [n=25]) or Cohort2 (waitlist control group [n=24]). Data were collected at three time points (Baseline, Year1 and Year2). A two-level (patient within agency) multinomial logistic regression model investigated the effects of implementation strategy condition on one of four medication outcomes: both medication types, only psychotropic medication, only addiction medication, or neither medication type. A per-protocol analysis included time, NIATx fidelity, and agency focus as predictors. The intent-to-treat analysis found a statistically significant change in access to addiction versus neither medication, but Cohort1 compared to Cohort2 at Year1 showed no differences. Changes were associated with the experimental intervention and occurred in the transition from Year 1 to Year 2, where greater increases were seen for agencies in Cohort2 versus Cohort1. The per-protocol analysis showed increased access to both medications and addiction medications from pre- to post-intervention for agencies in both cohorts; however, differences in change between high- and low-implementation agencies were not significant. Access to integrated services for people with CODs is a long-standing problem. NIATx implementation strategies had limited effectiveness in improving medication access for individuals with CODs. Implementation strategy adherence is associated with increased medication access.",Access To Medicines;Address;Control Groups;Gadidae;Health;Logistic Regression;Mental Health;Needs;Patients;Persons;Quality Improvement;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Time,Substance Abuse;Substance Use,Implement Res Pract,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
35954700,2022,Women-Reported Barriers and Facilitators of Continued Engagement with Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Opioid-related fatalities increased exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic and show little sign of abating. Despite decades of scientific evidence that sustained engagement with medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD) yields positive psychosocial outcomes, less than 30% of people with OUD engage in MOUD. Treatment rates are lowest for women. The aim of this project was to identify women-specific barriers and facilitators to treatment engagement, drawing from the lived experience of women in treatment. Data are provided from a parent study that used a community-partnered participatory research approach to adapt an evidence-based digital storytelling intervention for supporting continued MOUD treatment engagement. The parent study collected qualitative data between August and December 2018 from 20 women in Western Massachusetts who had received MOUD for at least 90 days. Using constructivist grounded theory, we identified major themes and selected illustrative quotations. Key barriers identified in this project include: (1) MOUD-specific discrimination encountered via social media, and in workplace and treatment/recovery settings; and (2) fear, perceptions, and experiences with MOUD, including mental health medication synergies, internalization of MOUD-related stigma, expectations of treatment duration, and opioid-specific mistrust of providers. Women identified two key facilitators to MOUD engagement: (1) feeling ""safe"" within treatment settings and (2) online communities as a source of positive reinforcement. We conclude with women-specific recommendations for research and interventions to improve MOUD engagement and provide human-centered care for this historically marginalized population.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Community;Drawing;Duration of Therapy;Expectations;Fear;Feelings;Female;Grounded Theory;Humans;Massachusetts;Mental Health;Methods;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Parents;Perception;Persons;Population;Positive Reinforcement;Research;Social Media;Substance Use;Therapeutics;Women;Workplace",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN)
31174714,2019,Determining spatial access to opioid use disorder treatment and emergency medical services in New Hampshire.,"This research presents an analysis of spatial access to both opioid use disorder treatment facilities and emergency medical services in New Hampshire during 2015-2016, a period during which there was a steep increase in unintentional overdoses involving fentanyl. For this research, spatial access was computed using the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model combined with the Huff model to assess access across New Hampshire and gives attention to supply-side parameters that can impact spatial access. The model is designed to measure access to healthcare services for opioid use disorder patients offered at treatment centers or from buprenorphine treatment practitioners, as well as from emergency medical services across New Hampshire. A composite index of accessibility is proposed to represent overall access to these different treatment services for opioid use disorder patients. Geospatial determinants of spatial access included street network distances, driving times and distance decay relationships, while other key factors were services availability and population demand. Among the towns with the highest composite access scores, approximately 40% were metropolitan locations while 16% were rural towns. The insights from this research showed that for this period, while the opioid crisis was impacting many towns in New Hampshire, high levels of access to treatment services were not uniform across the state. When comparing the access results with data on the towns of residence for individuals who died from unintentional overdoses involving fentanyl during 2015 and 2016, estimates found that approximately 40% of the towns were not estimated to be in the highest class of access to treatment services at the time.

We describe results of a retrospective chart review of 472 patients treated in the program between August 2015 and April 2019. We examined several demographic and substance use variables for individuals who consented to telemedicine treatment, retention in treatment over time, and opioid use over time to understand further the impact of prescribing buprenorphine and naltrexone via telemedicine to patients in a rural OUD treatment setting. Our findings support the effectiveness of prescribing medications via telemedicine. The inclusion of more than three times as many patients as in our prior report revealed retention rates and toxicology results that are comparable to face-to-face treatment. These findings have implications for policymakers and clinicians considering implementation of similar programs.",Academic Medical Centers;Buprenorphine;Chart;Demography;Drug Rehabilitation Center;Face;Goals;Health;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Patients;Program;Report;Review;Substance Use;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Videoconferencing,Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use,Heroin Addict Relat Clin Probl,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Prevention
33828350,2021,Incorporating space and time into random forest models for analyzing geospatial patterns of drug-related crime incidents in a major U.S. metropolitan area.,"The opioid crisis has hit American cities hard, and research on spatial and temporal patterns of drug-related activities including detecting and predicting clusters of crime incidents involving particular types of drugs is useful for distinguishing hot zones where drugs are present that in turn can further provide a basis for assessing and providing related treatment services. In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of more than 52,000 reported incidents of drug-related crime at block group granularity in Chicago, IL between 2016 and 2019. We applied a space-time analysis framework and machine learning approaches to build a model using training data that identified whether certain locations and built environment and sociodemographic factors were correlated with drug-related crime incident patterns, and establish the top contributing factors that underlaid the trends. Space and time, together with multiple driving factors, were incorporated into a random forest model to analyze these changing patterns. We accommodated both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the model learning process to assist with capturing the changes over time and tested the capabilities of the space-time random forest model by predicting drug-related activity hot zones. We focused particularly on crime incidents that involved heroin and synthetic drugs as these have been key drug types that have highly impacted cities during the opioid crisis in the U.S.",Built Environment;Chicago;Cities;Crime;Forests;Heroin;Learning;Machine Learning;Opioid Crisis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Research;Synthetic Drugs;Therapeutics;Time,,Comput Environ Urban Syst,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Prevention
36183109,2022,"""I don't go to funerals anymore"": how people who use opioids grieve drug-related death in the US overdose epidemic.","Opioid-related overdose death is a public health epidemic in much of the USA, yet little is known about how people who use opioids (PWUO) experience overdose deaths in their social networks. We explore these experiences through a qualitative study of opioid-related overdose death bereavement among PWUO. We recruited 30 adults who inject opioids from a syringe service program in the Midwestern USA and interviewed them using a semi-structured guide that addressed experiences of opioid use, opioid-related overdose, and overdose reversal via the medication naloxone. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Participants described overdose death as ever-present in their social worlds. Most (approximately 75%) reported at least one overdose death in their social network, and many came to consider death an inevitable end of opioid use. Participants described grief shaped by complex social relations and mourning that was interrupted due to involvement with social services and criminal legal systems. They also reported several ways that overdose deaths influenced their drug use, with some increasing their use and others adopting safer drug use practices. Despite the high prevalence of overdose deaths in their social networks, only one participant reported receiving grief support services. Findings underscore the need for interventions that not only maintain life, such as naloxone distribution, but also improve quality of life by attending to grief related to overdose death bereavement. We discuss policies and practices with the potential to address the unique psychological, social, and structural challenges of grief for this population.","Address;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Bereavement;Criminals;Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Grief;Humans;Interview;Life;Mourning;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prevalence;Program;Public Health;Qualitative Research;Quality of Life;Social Networks;Social Work;Syringes",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Harm Reduct J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Prevention
33497963,2021,Expanding access to methadone treatment in Ohio through federally qualified health centers and a chain pharmacy: A geospatial modeling analysis.,"In the United States, methadone provision for opioid use disorder (OUD) occurs at opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Ohio recently enacted a policy to expand methadone administration to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC). We compared how the provision of methadone at current OTPs or the proposed expansion to FQHCs and pharmacies meets the urban and rural need for OUD treatment. Cross-sectional geospatial analysis of zip codes within Ohio with at least one 2017 opioid overdose death stratified by Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Our primary outcome was the proportion of need by zip code (using opioid overdose deaths as a proxy for need) within a 15- or 30- minute drive time of an OTP. Among 581 zip codes, sixty four percent of treatment need was within a 15-minute drive time and 81 %, within a 30-minute drive time. The proportion of need within a 15-minute drive decreased with increasing rural classification (urban 78 %, suburban 20 %, large rural 9%, and small rural 1%;p&lt;.001). The portion of need within a 15-minute drive time increased with the addition of FQHCs (96 %) and the addition of chain pharmacies (99 %) relative to OTPs alone among all zip codes and for all urban-rural strata (p&lt;.001). Over one-third of OUD treatment need was not covered by existing OTPs and coverage decreased with rural classification of zip codes. Most of the gap between supply and need could be mitigated with FQHC methadone provision, which would expand both urban and rural access.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Classification;Commuting;Cross-Sectional Studies;Death;Drive;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Male;Methadone;Needs;Ohio;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Services;Pharmacy;Policy;Program;Proxy;Relatives;Rural Population;Supplies;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Death;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery

This study initially explores the efficacy of the Substance Use Disorder Screening Instrument (ICTUS) in identifying symptoms associated with SUD among people living in and out of prisons. The ICTUS was developed by adapting the items of the Simple Screening Instrument for Substance Abuse (SSI-SA) to the DSM-5 criteria. ICTUS shows the ability to effectively identify those who meet diagnostic criteria for SUD when comparing percentages of substance use and diagnosis of SUD according to CIDI, a clinical measure. These results reveal that ICTUS can be considered as an appropriate alternative to objectively assess the symptoms associated with SUD and inform the planning and service provision process.",Ability;Diagnosis;Measures;Occupational Groups;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prisons;Screening;Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Time,Substance Abuse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Salud Conducta Humana,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Translation of Research to Practice for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction,Not,Justice & Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN);Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
35440688,2022,The impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic pain seeking care at a tertiary pain clinic.,"Empirical data on the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain scarce, especially among patients with chronic pain. We conducted a cross-sectional study matched by season to examine patient-reported health symptoms among patients with chronic pain pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic onset. Survey responses were analyzed from 7535 patients during their initial visit at a tertiary pain clinic between April 2017-October 2020. Surveys included measures of pain and pain-related physical, emotional, and social function. The post-COVID-19 onset cohort included 1798 initial evaluations, and the control pre-COVID-19 cohort included 5737 initial evaluations. Patients were majority female, White/Caucasian, and middle-aged. The results indicated that pain ratings remained unchanged among patients after the pandemic onset. However, pain catastrophizing scores were elevated when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020. Pain interference, physical function, sleep impairment, and emotional support were improved in the post-COVID-19 cohort. Depression, anxiety, anger, and social isolation remained unchanged. Our findings provide evidence of encouraging resilience among patients seeking treatment for pain conditions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our findings that pain catastrophizing increased when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020 suggests that future monitoring and consideration of the impacts of the pandemic on patients' pain is warranted.",Anger;Anxiety;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression;Face;Female;Future;Health;Humans;Measures;Middle Aged;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Clinics;Pandemics;Patients;SARS-CoV-2;Seasons;Sleep;Social Isolation;Surveys;Therapeutics;Whites,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Chronic Pain;Pain,Sci Rep,Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Mentorship of Junior Investigators
35465295,2022,Comparing Perceived Pain Impact Between Younger and Older Adults With High Impact Chronic Pain: A Cross-Sectional Qualitative and Quantitative Survey.,"High impact chronic pain (HICP) is a recently proposed concept for treatment stratifying patients with chronic pain and monitoring their progress. The goal is to reduce the impact of chronic pain on the individual, their family, and society. The US National Pain Strategy defined HICP as the chronic pain associated with substantial restrictions on participation in work, social, and self-care activities for at least 6 months. To understand the meaning and characteristics of HICP from the younger (&lt;65 years old) and older adults (≥65 years old) with chronic pain, our study examined patients' perceived pain impact between the two age groups. We also characterize the degree of pain impact, assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference (PI), between adults and older adults with HICP. We recruited patients at a tertiary pain clinic. The survey included open-ended questions about pain impact, the Graded Chronic Pain Scale-Revised to identify patients' meeting criteria for HICP, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) 8-item PI short form (v.8a). A total of 55 younger adults (65.5% women, 72.7% HICP, mean age = 55.0 with SD of 16.2) and 28 older adults (53.6% women, 64.3% HICP, mean age = 72.6 with SD of 5.4) with chronic pain participated in this study. In response to an open-ended question in which participants were asked to list out the areas of major impact pain, those with HICP in the younger group most commonly listed work, social activity, and basic physical activity (e.g., walking and standing); for those in the older group, basic physical activity, instrumental activity of daily living (e.g., housework, grocery shopping), and participating in social or fun activity for older adults with HICP were the most common. A 2 × 2 ANOVA was conducted using age (younger adults vs. older adults) and HICP classification (HICP vs. No HICP). A statistically significant difference was found in the PROMIS-PI T-scores by HICP status (HICP: M = 58.4, SD = 6.3; No HICP: M = 67.8, SD = 6.3), but not by age groups with HICP. In conclusion, perceived pain impacts were qualitatively, but not quantitatively different between younger and older adults with HICP.

35872631,2022,The Problem of Pain in Rheumatology: Clinical Profiles Associated With Concomitant Diagnoses With Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions.,"The chronification of pain is heterogeneous in rheumatology. Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) such as fibromyalgia, endometriosis, migraine, and back pain may co-occur with one another and in rheumatic diseases. We describe the sociodemographic and clinical profiles associated with concomitant COPCs among patients with rheumatic diseases. We retrospectively identified patients visiting rheumatology clinics at a single institution from 2010 to 2020 for five common rheumatic conditions: psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren syndrome (SjS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis (SSc). We compared sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors by rheumatic condition and by COPC status. We also report sex-stratified diagnosis of COPCs. The primary outcome was diagnostic validation of one or more COPCs. We identified 5992 rheumatology patients: 846 with PsA, 2605 with RA, 956 with SjS, 975 with SLE, and 610 with SSc. Approximately 36-62% of patients had a concomitant COPC diagnosis. Patients with SjS had the highest prevalence (62%). Diagnosis of one or more COPCs was highest among Black patients and lowest among Asian patients. Patients using public insurance had a higher prevalence of one or more COPCs compared with those with private insurance. Patients with one or more COPCs had more depression and anxiety and more frequent emergency department visits, surgeries, and hospitalizations. Our findings suggest that COPCs are strikingly common among patients with rheumatic disease and are associated with lower quality of life and greater health care needs. Future research may elucidate drivers of chronic pain and how to best address the unique analgesic needs of this multimorbid population.","Address;Analgesics;Anxiety;Arthritis, Psoriatic;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Asians;Back Pain;Blacks;Chronic Pain;Depression;Diagnosis;Emergency Service, Hospital;Endometriosis;Fibromyalgia;Future;General Surgery;Health Care;Hospitalization;Insurance;Lifestyle Factors;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic;Migraine Disorders;Needs;Pain;Patients;Population;Prevalence;Quality of Life;Report;Research;Rheumatic Diseases;Rheumatology;Scleroderma, Systemic;Sex;Sjogren's Syndrome","Arthritis, Psoriatic;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Back Pain;Chronic Pain;Endometriosis;Fibromyalgia;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic;Migraine Disorders;Pain;Rheumatic Diseases;Scleroderma, Systemic;Sjogren's Syndrome",ACR Open Rheumatol,Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Mentorship of Junior Investigators
35879602,2022,Altered resting-state functional connectivity within corticostriatal and subcortical-striatal circuits in chronic pain.,"Brain corticostriatal circuits are important for understanding chronic pain and highly relevant to motivation and cognitive processes. It has been demonstrated that in patients with chronic back pain, altered nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) circuit fMRI-based activity is predictive of patient outcome. We evaluated the NAcc-MPFC circuit in patients with another chronic pain condition, fibromyalgia, to extend these important findings. First, we compared fMRI-based NAcc-MPFC resting-state functional connectivity in patients with fibromyalgia (N = 32) vs. healthy controls (N = 37). Compared to controls, the NAcc-MPFC circuit's connectivity was significantly reduced in fibromyalgia. In addition, within the fibromyalgia group, NAcc-MPFC connectivity was significantly correlated with trait anxiety. Our expanded connectivity analysis of the NAcc to subcortical brain regions showed reduced connectivity of the right NAcc with mesolimbic circuit regions (putamen, thalamus, and ventral pallidum) in fibromyalgia. Lastly, in an exploratory analysis comparing our fibromyalgia and healthy control cohorts to a separate publicly available dataset from patients with chronic back pain, we identified reduced NAcc-MPFC connectivity across both the patient groups with unique alterations in NAcc-mesolimbic connectivity. Together, expanding upon prior observed alterations in brain corticostriatal circuits, our results provide novel evidence of altered corticostriatal and mesolimbic circuits in chronic pain.",Anxiety;Back Pain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Dataset;Fibromyalgia;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Motivation;Neural Pathways;Nucleus Accumbens;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Putamen;Thalamus;Ventral Pallidum;fMRI,Back Pain;Chronic Pain;Fibromyalgia,Sci Rep,Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Mentorship of Junior Investigators
35988161,2022,Increased pain catastrophizing longitudinally predicts worsened pain severity and interference in patients with chronic pain and cancer: A collaborative health outcomes information registry study (CHOIR).,"Little is known about how changes in psychosocial factors impact changes in pain outcomes among patients with cancer and chronic pain. This longitudinal cohort study of cancer patients investigated the relationships between changes in psychosocial factors and changes in pain severity and interference over time. Data from patients with cancer and chronic pain (n = 316) treated at a tertiary pain clinic were prospectively collected. At their baseline visit (Time 1), patients provided demographic and clinical information, and completed validated psychosocial and pain assessments. Psychosocial and pain assessments were repeated at a follow-up visit (Time 2), on average 4.9 months later. Change scores (Time 2-Time 1) were computed for psychosocial and pain variables. Multivariable hierarchical linear regressions assessed the associations between changes in psychosocial factors with changes in pain outcomes over time. Participants were an average age of 59 years, were 61% female, and 69% White. Overall, a decrease in pain severity (p ≤ 0.001), but not pain interference, was observed among the group over time. In multivariable analyses, increased pain catastrophizing was significantly associated with increased pain severity over time (β = 0.24, p ≤ 0.001). Similarly, increased pain catastrophizing (β = 0.21, p ≤ 0.001) and increased depression (β = 0.20, p ≤ 0.003) were significantly associated with increased pain interference over time. Demographic and clinical characteristics were not significantly related to changes in pain outcomes. Increased pain catastrophizing was uniquely associated with increased chronic pain severity and interference. Our findings indicate that cancer patients with chronic pain would likely benefit from the incorporation of nonpharmacological interventions, simultaneously addressing pain and psychological symptoms.","Association;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Catastrophization;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Demography;Depression;Female;Health;Humans;Linear Regression;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Neoplasms;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Overall;Pain;Pain Catastrophizing;Pain Clinics;Pain Measurement;Patients;Psychosocial Factors;Registries;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time;Whites",Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Neoplasms;Pain,Psychooncology,Cross-Cutting Projects,Not,Mentorship of Junior Investigators

36301800,2022,CHOIRBM: An R package for exploratory data analysis and interactive visualization of pain patient body map data.,"Body maps are commonly used to capture the location of a patient's pain and thus reflect the extent of pain throughout the body. With increasing electronic capture body map information, there is an emerging need for clinic- and research-ready tools capable of visualizing this data on individual and mass scales. Here we propose CHOIRBM, an extensible and modular R package and companion web application built on the grammar of graphics system. CHOIRBM provides functions that simplify the process of analyzing and plotting patient body map data integrated from the CHOIR Body Map (CBM) at both individual patient and large-dataset levels. CHOIRBM is built on the popular R graphics package, ggplot2, which facilitates further development and addition of functionality by the open-source development community as future requirements arise. The CHOIRBM package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license and is available on CRAN. The development version of the package with the latest functions may be installed from GitHub.

36526937,2022,Hypnosis and relaxation interventions for chronic pain management in cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.,"Nonpharmacological interventions such as hypnosis show promising evidence for the self-management of pain and pain-related sequelae among cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 4-week recorded hypnosis intervention in reducing pain intensity compared to a recorded relaxation intervention in cancer survivors with chronic pain. Adult cancer survivors were randomly assigned to listen to hypnosis (n = 55) or relaxation recordings (n = 54) daily for 28 days. Primary (pain intensity) and secondary outcomes (pain interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance) measures were completed pre- and post-treatment. Treatment effects were evaluated using a series of analyses of covariance. Both hypnosis and relaxation provided significant and moderate to large improvements in the primary outcome and the secondary outcomes of pain interference and anxiety (ds = 0.44-0.88). The hypnosis group also experienced a moderate improvement in fatigue (d = 0.47) and sleep disturbance (d = 0.54). The effect size for pain reduction from pre- to post-treatment for the hypnosis group was d = 0.86 and for the relaxation group, d = 0.88. There were no significant between-group differences in primary and secondary outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. The results support that recorded hypnosis and relaxation interventions are similarly effective in reducing pain and the pain-related sequelae of pain interference and anxiety among cancer survivors with chronic pain.

36561218,2022,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis to Inform Randomized Controlled Trial Design in Chronic Pain Research: Methods for Guiding Decisions on the Addition of a Run-In Period.,"Run-In (RI) periods can be used to improve the validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but their utility in Chronic Pain (CP) RCTs is debated. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) methods are commonly used in evaluating the results of RCTs, but they are seldom used for designing RCTs. We present a step-by-step overview to objectively design RCTs via CEA methods and specifically determine the cost effectiveness of a RI period in a CP RCT. We applied the CEA methodology to data obtained from several noninvasive brain stimulation CP RCTs, specifically focusing on (1) defining the CEA research question, (2) identifying RCT phases and cost ingredients, (3) discounting, (4) modeling the stochastic nature of the RCT, and (5) performing sensitivity analyses. We assessed the average cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental cost effectiveness ratios of varied RCT designs and the impact on cost-effectiveness by the inclusion of a RI period vs. No-Run-In (NRI) period. We demonstrated the potential impact of varying the number of institutions, number of patients that could be accommodated per institution, cost and effectiveness discounts, RCT component costs, and patient adherence characteristics on varied RI and NRI RCT designs. In the specific CP RCT designs that we analyzed, we demonstrated that lower patient adherence, lower baseline assessment costs, and higher treatment costs all necessitated the inclusion of an RI period to be cost-effective compared to NRI RCT designs. Clinical trialists can optimize CP RCT study designs and make informed decisions regarding RI period inclusion/exclusion via CEA methods.",Brain;Chronic Pain;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis;Methods;Nature;Patient Compliance;Patients;Randomized Controlled Trial;Research;Sensitivity;Treatment Costs,Chronic Pain,Princ Pract Clin Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction;Pain Preclinical Research;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,NIDA SBIRNINDS SBIR

Hosts and each microbiota are governed by distinct central dogmas, with genetics influencing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Each microbiota's metabolome differentially modulates its own and the host's multi-omics. Exogenous compounds (e.g., drugs and toxins), often affect host multi-omics differently than microbiota multi-omics, shifting the balance between drug efficacy and toxicity. The complexity of the host-microbiota connection has been informed by current methods of in vitro bacterial cultures and in vivo mouse models, but they fail to elucidate mechanistic details. Together, in vitro organ-on-chip microphysiological models, multi-omics, and in silico computational models have the potential to supplement the established methods to help clinical pharmacologists and environmental toxicologists unravel the myriad of connections between the gut microbiota and host health and disease.","Affect;Animals;Bacteria;Brain;Central Nervous System;Computer Simulation;Culture;Diet;Disease;Ecotoxicology;Gastrointestinal Microbiome;Genetics;Genomics;Health;Host-Pathogen Interactions;Humans;In Silico;In Vitro;Intestines;Lab-On-A-Chip Devices;Liver;Metabolome;Metabolomics;Methods;Mice;Microbiome;Microbiota;Microchip Analytical Procedures;Models, Animal;Models, Biological;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology, Clinical;Proteomics",,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
32623788,2022,Delta opioid receptor activation modulates affective pain and modality-specific pain hypersensitivity associated with chronic neuropathic pain.,"Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists alleviate nociceptive behaviors in various chronic pain models, including neuropathic pain, while having minimal effect on sensory thresholds in the absence of injury. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced enhancement of DOR function are unclear. We used a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) model of neuropathic pain to assess changes in the function and localization of DORs in mice and rats. Intrathecal administration of DOR agonists reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The dose-dependent thermal antinociceptive effects of DOR agonists were shifted to the left in PNI rats. Administration of DOR agonists produced a conditioned place preference in PNI, but not in sham, animals, whereas the DOR antagonist naltrindole produced a place aversion in PNI, but not in sham, mice, suggesting the engagement of endogenous DOR activity in suppressing pain associated with the injury. GTPγS autoradiography revealed an increase in DOR function in the dorsal spinal cord, ipsilateral to PNI. Immunogold electron microscopy and in vivo fluorescent agonist assays were used to assess changes in the ultrastructural localization of DORs in the spinal dorsal horn. In shams, DORs were primarily localized within intracellular compartments. PNI significantly increased the cell surface expression of DORs within lamina IV-V dendritic profiles. Using neonatal capsaicin treatment, we identified that DOR agonist-induced thermal antinociception was mediated via receptors expressed on primary afferent sensory neurons but did not alter mechanical thresholds. These data reveal that the regulation of DORs following PNI and suggest the importance of endogenous activation of DORs in regulating chronic pain states.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Autoradiography;Behavior;Capsaicin;Cells;Chronic Pain;Disease Models, Animal;Ganglia, Spinal;Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate);Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Lamina IV;Mechanical Allodynia;Mice;Microscopy, Electron;Neuralgia;Nociception;Opiate Alkaloids;Opioids;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;Rats;Receptors, Opioid;Receptors, Opioid, delta;Regulation;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sensory Thresholds;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;Therapeutics","Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Hyperalgesia, Thermal;Hypersensitivity;Injuries;Mechanical Allodynia;Neuralgia;Pain;Peripheral Nerve Injuries",J Neurosci Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
32751156,2020,"Pathogenesis of Osteoarthritis: Risk Factors, Regulatory Pathways in Chondrocytes, and Experimental Models.","As the most common chronic degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and physical disability, affecting millions of people worldwide. Mainly characterized by articular cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation, OA is a heterogeneous disease that impacts all component tissues of the articular joint organ. Pathological changes, and thus symptoms, vary from person to person, underscoring the critical need of personalized therapies. However, there has only been limited progress towards the prevention and treatment of OA, and there are no approved effective disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs). Conventional treatments, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy, are still the major remedies to manage the symptoms until the need for total joint replacement. In this review, we provide an update of the known OA risk factors and relevant mechanisms of action. In addition, given that the lack of biologically relevant models to recapitulate human OA pathogenesis represents one of the major roadblocks in developing DMOADs, we discuss current in vivo and in vitro experimental OA models, with special emphasis on recent development and application potential of human cell-derived microphysiological tissue chip platforms.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal;Bone Remodeling;Cartilage, Articular;Cells;Chondrocytes;Disease;Experimental Model;Humans;In Vitro;Inflammation;Joint Diseases;Joints;Needs;Osteoarthritis;Osteophyte;Pain;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Therapy;Review;Risk Factors;Therapeutics;Tissues;Total Joint Replacement",Inflammation;Joint Diseases;Osteoarthritis;Osteophyte;Pain,Biology (Basel),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
33048854,2021,Optogenetic inhibition of the colon epithelium reduces hypersensitivity in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Visceral pain is a prevalent symptom of inflammatory bowel disease that can be difficult to treat. Pain and hypersensitivity are mediated by extrinsic primary afferent neurons (ExPANs) that innervate the colon. Recent studies indicate that the colon epithelium contributes to initiating ExPAN firing and nociceptive responses. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the epithelium contributes to inflammation-induced hypersensitivity. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that inhibition of the epithelium would attenuate nociceptive signaling and inflammatory hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, the inhibitory yellow light-activated protein archaerhodopsin was targeted to the intestinal epithelium (villin-Arch) or the ExPANs (TRPV1-Arch) that innervate the colon. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by measuring the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD), with and without yellow light illumination of the colon lumen. Inhibition of the colon epithelium in healthy villin-Arch mice significantly diminished the CRD-induced VMR. Direct inhibition of ExPANs during CRD using TRPV1-Arch mice showed that ExPAN and epithelial inhibition were similarly effective in reducing the VMR to CRD. We then investigated the effect of epithelial and ExPAN inhibition in the dextran sulfate sodium model of inflammatory bowel disease. Inhibition of the colon epithelium significantly decreased dextran sulfate sodium-induced hypersensitivity and was comparable with the inhibition of ExPANs. Together, these results reveal the potential of targeting the colon epithelium for the treatment of pain.","Animals;Colon;Dextran Sulfate Sodium;Epithelium;Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestinal Epithelium;Intestinal Mucosa;Light;Lighting;Mice;Neurons, Afferent;Optogenetics;Pain;Proteins;Sensitivity;Therapeutics;Visceral Pain",Hypersensitivity;Inflammation;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Pain;Visceral Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
33245509,2021,"Oxycodone in the Opioid Epidemic: High 'Liking', 'Wanting', and Abuse Liability.","It is estimated that nearly a third of people who abuse drugs started with prescription opioid medicines. Approximately, 11.5 million Americans used prescription drugs recreationally in 2016, and in 2018, 46,802 Americans died as the result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl (National Institutes on Drug Abuse (2020) Opioid Overdose Crisis. https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis . Accessed 06 June 2020). Yet physicians will continue to prescribe oral opioids for moderate-to-severe pain in the absence of alternative therapeutics, underscoring the importance in understanding how drug choice can influence detrimental outcomes. One of the opioid prescription medications that led to this crisis is oxycodone, where misuse of this drug has been rampant. Being one of the most highly prescribed opioid medications for treating moderate-to-severe pain as reflected in the skyrocketed increase in retail sales of 866% between 1997 and 2007, oxycodone was initially suggested to be less addictive than morphine. The false-claimed non-addictive formulation of oxycodone, OxyContin, further contributed to the opioid crisis. Abuse was often carried out by crushing the pills for immediate burst release, typically by nasal insufflation, or by liquefying the pills for intravenous injection. Here, we review oxycodone pharmacology and abuse liability as well as present the hypothesis that oxycodone may exhibit a unique pharmacology that contributes to its high likability and abuse susceptibility. We will discuss various mechanisms that likely contribute to the high abuse rate of oxycodone including clinical drug likability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, differences in its actions within mesolimbic reward circuity compared to other opioids, and the possibility of differential molecular and cellular receptor interactions that contribute to its selective effects. We will also discuss marketing strategies and drug difference that likely contributes to the oxycodone opioid use disorders and addiction.","Allosteric Site;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior, Addictive;Comprehension;Dopamine;Drug Abuse;Exhibition;Fentanyl;Heroin;Humans;Incentives;Injections, Intravenous;Insufflation;Marketing;Medicine;Morphine;National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.);Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Pain;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacokinetics;Pharmacology;Physicians;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Review;Reward;Sales;Therapeutics",Drug Abuse;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
33547588,2022,Kappa Opioid Signaling at the Crossroads of Chronic Pain and Opioid Addiction.,"Pain is complex and is a unique experience for individuals in that no two people will have exactly the same physiological and emotional response to the same noxious stimulus or injury. Pain is composed of two essential processes: a sensory component that allows for discrimination of the intensity and location of a painful stimulus and an emotional component that underlies the affective, motivational, unpleasant, and aversive response to a painful stimulus. Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation in the periphery and throughout the neuroaxis modulates both of these components of the pain experience. In this chapter we focus on recent findings that KORs contribute to the emotional, aversive nature of chronic pain, including how expression in the limbic circuitry contributes to anhedonic states and components of opioid misuse disorder. While the primary focus is on preclinical pain models, we also highlight clinical or human research where there is strong evidence for KOR involvement in negative affective states associated with chronic pain and opioid misuse.","Affect;Amygdala;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Anhedonia;Chronic Pain;Dopamine;Dynorphins;Humans;Injuries;Nature;Neuralgia;Nociception;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Persons;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Research;Signal Transduction;Ventral Tegmental Area",Anhedonia;Chronic Pain;Injuries;Neuralgia;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,Handb Exp Pharmacol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms

35265942,2021,Mechanisms Underlying the Anti-Suicidal Treatment Potential of Buprenorphine.,"Death by suicide is a global epidemic with over 800 K suicidal deaths worlwide in 2012. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among Americans and more than 44 K people died by suicide in 2019 in the United States. Patients with chronic pain, including, but not limited to, those with substance use disorders, are particularly vulnerable. Chronic pain patients have twice the risk of death by suicide compared to those without pain, and 50% of chronic pain patients report that they have considered suicide at some point due to their pain. The kappa opioid system is implicated in negative mood states including dysphoria, depression, and anxiety, and recent evidence shows that chronic pain increases the function of this system in limbic brain regions important for affect and motivation. Additionally, dynorphin, the endogenous ligand that activates the kappa opioid receptor is increased in the caudate putamen of human suicide victims. A potential treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts is buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, a partial mu opioid agonist with kappa opioid antagonist properties, reduced suicidal ideation in chronic pain patients with and without an opioid use disorder. This review will highlight the clinical and preclinical evidence to support the use of buprenorphine in mitigating pain-induced negative affective states and suicidal thoughts, where these effects are at least partially mediated via its kappa antagonist properties.","Affect;Anhedonia;Anxiety;Brain;Buprenorphine;Cause of Death;Chronic Pain;Death;Depression;Dynorphins;Epidemics;Humans;Ligands;Mood;Motivation;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Persons;Putamen;Receptors, Opioid, kappa;Report;Review;Risk;Substance Use Disorders;Suicidal Ideation;Suicide;Therapeutics;Thought;United States",Anhedonia;Chronic Pain;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Substance Use Disorders,Adv Drug Alcohol Res,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
35438669,2022,Local translation in primary afferents and its contribution to pain.,"Chronic pain remains a significant problem due to its prevalence, impact, and limited therapeutic options. Progress in addressing chronic pain is dependent on a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. Although the available evidence suggests that changes within the central nervous system contribute to the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain, it also suggests that the primary afferent plays a critical role in all phases of the manifestation of chronic pain in most of those who suffer. Most notable among the changes in primary afferents is an increase in excitability or sensitization. A number of mechanisms have been identified that contribute to primary afferent sensitization with evidence for both increases in pronociceptive signaling molecules, such as voltage-gated sodium channels, and decreases in antinociceptive signaling molecules, such as voltage-dependent or calcium-dependent potassium channels. Furthermore, these changes in signaling molecules seem to reflect changes in gene expression as well as posttranslational processing. A mechanism of sensitization that has received far less attention, however, is the local or axonal translation of these signaling molecules. A growing body of evidence indicates that this process not only is dynamically regulated but also contributes to the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain. Here, we review the biology of local translation in primary afferents and its relevance to pain pathobiology.","Attention;Biology;Central Nervous System;Chronic Pain;Comprehension;Gene Expression;Humans;Maintenance;Pain;Play;Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated;Prevalence;Review;Role;Signal Transduction;Therapeutics;Translations;Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels",Chronic Pain;Pain,Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
36089217,2022,"Neuronally expressed PDL1, not PD1, suppresses acute nociception.","PDL1 is a protein that induces immunosuppression by binding to PD1 expressed on immune cells. In line with historical studies, we found that membrane-bound PD1 expression was largely restricted to immune cells; PD1 was not detectable at either the mRNA or protein level in peripheral neurons using single neuron qPCR, immunolabeling and flow cytometry. However, we observed widespread expression of PDL1 in both sensory and sympathetic neurons that could have important implications for patients receiving immunotherapies targeting this pathway that include unexpected autonomic and sensory related effects. While signaling pathways downstream of PD1 are well established, little to no information is available regarding the intracellular signaling downstream of membrane-bound PDL1 (also known as reverse signaling). Here, we administered soluble PD1 to engage neuronally expressed PDL1 and found that PD1 significantly reduced nocifensive behaviors evoked by algogenic capsaicin. We used calcium imaging to examine the underlying neural mechanism of this reduction and found that exogenous PD1 diminished TRPV1-dependent calcium transients in dissociated sensory neurons. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in membrane expression of TRPV1 following administration of PD1. Exogenous PD1 had no effect on pain-related behaviors in sensory neuron specific PDL1 knockout mice. These data indicate that neuronal PDL1 activation is sufficient to modulate sensitivity to noxious stimuli and as such, may be an important homeostatic mechanism for regulating acute nociception.","Administration;Analgesia;Animals;B7-H1 Antigen;Behavior;Calcium;Capsaicin;Cells;Diagnosis-Related Groups;Flow Cytometry;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Membranes;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Pain;Patients;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Sensitivity;Sensory Receptor Cells;Sex Characteristics;Transients",Pain,Brain Behav Immun,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Novel Drugs and Human Cell-Based Screening Platforms
36195606,2022,Oxytocin and orexin systems bidirectionally regulate the ability of opioid cues to bias reward seeking.,"As opioid-related fatalities continue to rise, the need for novel opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments could not be more urgent. Two separate hypothalamic neuropeptide systems have shown promise in preclinical OUD models. The oxytocin system, originating in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), may protect against OUD severity. By contrast, the orexin system, originating in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), may exacerbate OUD severity. Thus, activating the oxytocin system or inhibiting the orexin system are potential therapeutic strategies. The specific role of these systems with regard to specific OUD outcomes, however, is not fully understood. Here, we probed the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological interventions targeting the orexin or oxytocin system on two distinct metrics of OUD severity in rats-heroin choice (versus choice for natural reward, i.e., food) and cued reward seeking. Using a preclinical model that generates approximately equal choice between heroin and food reward, we examined the impact of exogenously administered oxytocin, an oxytocin receptor antagonist (L-368,899), and a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA-12) on opioid choice. Whereas these agents did not alter heroin choice when rewards (heroin and food) were available, oxytocin and DORA-12 each significantly reduced heroin seeking in the presence of competing reward cues when no rewards were available. In addition, the number of LH orexin neurons and PVN oxytocin neurons correlated with specific behavioral economic variables indicative of heroin versus food motivation. These data identify a novel bidirectional role of the oxytocin and orexin systems in the ability of opioid-related cues to bias reward seeking.","Ability;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Bias;Cues;Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists;Economics, Behavioral;Food;Heroin;Hypothalamic Area, Lateral;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Metric;Motivation;Needs;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Orexin Receptor Antagonists;Orexins;Oxytocin;Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus;Rats;Receptors, Oxytocin;Reward;Role;Therapeutics",Opioid Use Disorder,Transl Psychiatry,Medication Development for OUD,Not,Novel Targets for Opioid Use Disorders and Opioid Overdose
31764390,2020,"Graded chronic pain scale revised: mild, bothersome, and high-impact chronic pain.","Drawing on advances in chronic pain metrics, a simplified Graded Chronic Pain Scale-Revised was developed to differentiate mild, bothersome, and high-impact chronic pain. Graded Chronic Pain Scale-Revised was validated among adult enrollees of 2 health plans (N = 2021). In this population, the prevalence of chronic pain (pain present most or every day, prior 3 months) was 40.5%: 15.4% with mild chronic pain (lower pain intensity and interference); 10.1% bothersome chronic pain (moderate to severe pain intensity with lower interference with life activities); and 15.0% high-impact chronic pain (sustained pain-related activity limitations). Persons with mild chronic pain vs those without chronic pain showed small differences on 10 health status indicators (unfavorable health perceptions, activity limitations, and receiving long-term opioid therapy), with nonsignificant differences for 7 of 10 indicators. Persons with bothersome vs mild chronic pain differed significantly on 6 of 10 indicators (eg, negative pain coping beliefs, psychological distress, unfavorable health perceptions, and pain-related interference with overall activities). Persons with high-impact chronic pain differed significantly from those with mild chronic pain on all 10 indicators. Persons with high-impact chronic pain, relative to those with bothersome chronic pain, were more likely to have substantial activity limitations (significant differences for 4 of 5 disability indicators) and more often received long-term opioid therapy. Graded Chronic Pain Scale-Revised strongly predicted 5 activity-limitation indicators with area under receiver operating characteristic curve coefficients of 0.76 to 0.89.

34961554,2021,Methadone initiation in a bridge clinic for opioid withdrawal and opioid treatment program linkage: a case report applying the 72-hour rule.,"In the United States, methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited to highly regulated opioid treatment programs (OTPs), rendering it inaccessible to many patients. The ""72-hour rule"" allows non-OTP providers to administer methadone for emergency opioid withdrawal management while arranging ongoing care. Low-barrier substance use disorder (SUD) bridge clinics provide rapid access to buprenorphine but offer an opportunity to treat acute opioid withdrawal while facilitating OTP linkage. We describe the case of a patient with OUD who received methadone for opioid withdrawal in a bridge clinic and linked to an OTP within 72 h. A 54-year-old woman with severe OUD was seen in a SUD bridge clinic requesting OTP linkage and assessed with a clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) score of 12. She reported daily nasal use of 1 g heroin/fentanyl. Prior OUD treatment included buprenorphine-naloxone, which was only partially effective. Her acute opioid withdrawal was treated with a single observed oral dose of methadone 20 mg. She returned the following day with persistent opioid withdrawal (COWS score 11) and was treated with methadone 40 mg. On day 3, the patient was successfully admitted to a local OTP, where she remained engaged 3 months later. While patients continue to face substantial access barriers, bridge clinics can play an important role in treating opioid withdrawal, building partnerships with OTPs to initiate methadone on demand, and preventing life-threatening delays to methadone treatment. Federal policy reform is urgently needed to make methadone more accessible to people with OUD.","Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;Case Reports;Emergencies;Face;Female;Fentanyl;Heroin;Humans;Life;Methadone;Middle Aged;Opiate Alkaloids;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Play;Policy;Program;Role;Scales;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;United States;Women",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,Addict Sci Clin Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Optimizing Care for People with OUD and Mental Health Conditions
33203717,2021,Pharmacological Manipulation of Translation as a Therapeutic Target for Chronic Pain.,"Dysfunction in regulation of mRNA translation is an increasingly recognized characteristic of many diseases and disorders, including cancer, diabetes, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, and chronic pain. Approximately 50 million adults in the United States experience chronic pain. This economic burden is greater than annual costs associated with heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined. Treatment options for chronic pain are inadequately efficacious and riddled with adverse side effects. There is thus an urgent unmet need for novel approaches to treating chronic pain. Sensitization of neurons along the nociceptive pathway causes chronic pain states driving symptoms that include spontaneous pain and mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. More than a decade of preclinical research demonstrates that translational mechanisms regulate the changes in gene expression that are required for ongoing sensitization of nociceptive sensory neurons. This review will describe how key translation regulation signaling pathways, including the integrated stress response, mammalian target of rapamycin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases, impact the translation of different subsets of mRNAs. We then place these mechanisms of translation regulation in the context of chronic pain states, evaluate currently available therapies, and examine the potential for developing novel drugs. Considering the large body of evidence now published in this area, we propose that pharmacologically manipulating specific aspects of the translational machinery may reverse key neuronal phenotypic changes causing different chronic pain conditions. Therapeutics targeting these pathways could eventually be first-line drugs used to treat chronic pain disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Translational mechanisms regulating protein synthesis underlie phenotypic changes in the sensory nervous system that drive chronic pain states. This review highlights regulatory mechanisms that control translation initiation and how to exploit them in treating persistent pain conditions. We explore the role of mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase inhibitors and AMPK activators in alleviating pain hypersensitivity. Modulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation is also discussed as a potential therapy. Targeting specific translation regulation mechanisms may reverse changes in neuronal hyperexcitability associated with painful conditions.","AMP-Activated Protein Kinases;Adult;Autoimmunity;Cancer;Chronic Pain;Cost;Disease;Drive;Economics;Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2;Gene Expression;Heart Diseases;Humans;Hypersensitivity;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Needs;Nervous System;Neurons;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;RNA, Messenger;Regulation;Research;Review;Role;Sensory Receptor Cells;Signal Transduction;Sirolimus;TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases;Therapeutics;Translations;United States",Cancer;Chronic Pain;Heart Diseases;Hypersensitivity;Pain,Pharmacol Rev,Pain Preclinical Research;Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Optimizing Non-Addictive Therapies to Treat Pain
32168224,2020,Hepatitis C Virus Antibody Screening in a Cohort of Pregnant Women: Identifying Seroprevalence and Risk Factors.,"To describe the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, evaluate current risk factors associated with HCV antibody positivity, and identify novel composite risk factors for identification of groups most likely to demonstrate HCV antibody seropositivity in an obstetric population from 2012 to 2015. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network initiated an observational study of mother-to-child transmission of HCV in 2012 that included offering HCV antibody screening to their entire obstetric population. Women presenting for prenatal care before 23 weeks of gestation without a known multifetal gestation were eligible. For each woman who was HCV antibody-positive, two women at similar gestational age who were HCV antibody-negative were identified and included for comparison. Risk factors were evaluated by patient interview and chart review. Women in the case group were identified to have a signal-to-cutoff value of at least 5 on the Abbott ARCHITECT platform. RNA status was evaluated for women in the case group. Of 106,842 women screened for the HCV antibody, 254 had positive results. The HCV antibody seroprevalence rate was 2.4 cases per 1,000 women (95% CI 2.1-2.7). One hundred thirty-one women in the case group and 251 women in the control group were included in the case-control analysis. Factors associated with HCV antibody positivity included injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 22.9, 95% CI 8.2-64.0), blood transfusion (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3-10.4), having a partner with HCV (aOR 6.3, 95% CI 1.8-22.6), more than three lifetime sexual partners (aOR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4-19.8), and smoking (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6). A composite of any of these potential risk factors provided the highest sensitivity for detecting HCV antibody (75/82 cases, 91%). In this cohort, the seroprevalence of HCV antibody was low, and the current risk factors for HCV screening were not identified.

35227646,2022,Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics Associated With Worst Pain Intensity Among Cancer Patients.,"Patients with cancer have pain due to their cancer, the cancer treatment and other causes, and the pain intensity varies considerably between individuals. Additional research is needed to understand the factors associated with worst pain intensity. Our study aim was to determine the association between worst pain intensity and sociodemographics and cancerspecific factors among patients with cancer. A total of 1,280 patients with cancer recruited from multiple cancer centers over 25 years in the United States were asked to complete a questionnaire that collected respondents' demographic, chronic pain, and cancer-specific information. Worst, least, and current pain intensities were captured using a modified McGill Pain Questionnaire (pain intensity measured on 0-10 scale). A generalized linear regression analysis was utilized to assess the associations between significant bivariate predictors and worst pain intensity scores.Our study sample was non-Hispanic White (64.5%), non-Hispanic Black (28.3%), and Hispanic (7.2%). On average, participants were 59.4 (standard deviation = 14.4) years old. The average worst pain intensity score was 6.6 (standard deviation = 2.50). After controlling for selected covariates, being Hispanic (β = 0.6859), previous toothache pain (β = 0.0960), headache pain (β = 0.0549), and stomachache pain (β = 0.0577) were positively associated with worse cancer pain. Notably, year of enrollment was not statistically associated with pain. Our study sample was non-Hispanic White (64.5%), non-Hispanic Black (28.3%), and Hispanic (7.2%). On average, participants were 59.4 (standard deviation = 14.4) years old. The average worst pain intensity score was 6.6 (standard deviation = 2.50). After controlling for selected covariates, being Hispanic (β = 0.6859), previous toothache pain (β = 0.0960), headache pain (β = 0.0549), and stomachache pain (β = 0.0577) were positively associated with worse cancer pain. Notably, year of enrollment was not statistically associated with pain. Findings identified being Hispanic and having previous severe toothache, stomachache, and headache pain as significant predictors of worst pain intensity among patients with cancer. After controlling for selected covariates, we did not note statistical differences in worst pain during a 25-year period. Therefore,studies focused on improving the management of pain among patients with cancer should target interventions for those with Hispanic heritage and those with past history of severe common pain.",Aged;Association;Blacks;Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Demography;Headache;Hispanics;History;Humans;Latinos;Linear Regression;McGill Pain Questionnaire;Middle Aged;Neoplasms;Pain;Pain Measurement;Patients;Questionnaires;Research;Respondents;Scales;Standards;Therapeutics;Toothache;United States;Whites,Cancer;Cancer Pain;Chronic Pain;Headache;Neoplasms;Pain;Toothache,Pain Manag Nurs,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Not,Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network (ERN)
29241103,2018,Prevalence and correlates of benzodiazepine use and misuse among young adults who use prescription opioids non-medically.,"Benzodiazepine use dramatically increases the risk of unintentional overdose among people who use opioids non-medically. However, little is known about the patterns of co-occurring benzodiazepine and opioid use among young adults in the United States. The Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS) was a cross-sectional study from January 2015-February 2016. RAPiDS recruited 200 young adults aged 18-29 who reported past 30-day non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use. Using Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test, we examined correlates associated with regular prescribed and non-medical use (defined as at least monthly) of benzodiazepines among NMPO users in Rhode Island. Among participants, 171 (85.5%) reported lifetime benzodiazepine use and 125 (62.5%) reported regular benzodiazepine use. Nearly all (n=121, 96.8%) reported non-medical use and 43 (34.4%) reported prescribed use. Compared to the 75 participants who did not regularly use benzodiazepines, participants who reported regular use were more likely to be white (66.3% vs. 58.0%, p=0.03), have ever been incarcerated (52.8% vs. 37.3%, p=0.04), and have ever been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (bipolar: 29.6% vs. 16.0%, p=0.04; anxiety: 56.8 vs. 36.0%, p=0.01). Although the association was marginally significant, accidental overdose was higher among those who were prescribed the benzodiazepine they used most frequently compared to those who were not (41.9% vs. 24.4%, p=0.06). Benzodiazepine use and misuse are highly prevalent among young adult NMPO users. Harm reduction and prevention programs for this population are urgently needed.","Adolescent;Adolescent Health;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Association;Benzodiazepine;Comorbidity;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Harm Reduction;Humans;Male;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Mood Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Program;Rank-Sum Tests;Rhode Island;Risk;United States;Whites;Young Adult",Mental Disorders;Mood Disorders;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
29404943,2018,Prediction of Future Chronic Opioid Use Among Hospitalized Patients.,"Opioids are commonly prescribed in the hospital; yet, little is known about which patients will progress to chronic opioid therapy (COT) following discharge. We defined COT as receipt of ≥ 90-day supply of opioids with &lt; 30-day gap in supply over a 180-day period or receipt of ≥ 10 opioid prescriptions over 1 year. Predictive tools to identify hospitalized patients at risk for future chronic opioid use could have clinical utility to improve pain management strategies and patient education during hospitalization and discharge. The objective of this study was to identify a parsimonious statistical model for predicting future COT among hospitalized patients not on COT before hospitalization. Retrospective analysis electronic health record (EHR) data from 2008 to 2014 using logistic regression. Hospitalized patients at an urban, safety net hospital. Independent variables included medical and mental health diagnoses, substance and tobacco use disorder, chronic or acute pain, surgical intervention during hospitalization, past year receipt of opioid or non-opioid analgesics or benzodiazepines, opioid receipt at hospital discharge, milligrams of morphine equivalents prescribed per hospital day, and others. Model prediction performance was estimated using area under the receiver operator curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A model with 13 covariates was chosen using stepwise logistic regression on a randomly down-sampled subset of the data. Sensitivity and specificity were optimized using the Youden's index. This model predicted correctly COT in 79% of the patients and no COT correctly in 78% of the patients. Our model accessed EHR data to predict 79% of the future COT among hospitalized patients. Application of such a predictive model within the EHR could identify patients at high risk for future chronic opioid use to allow clinicians to provide early patient education about pain management strategies and, when able, to wean opioids prior to discharge while incorporating alternative therapies for pain into discharge planning.","Acute Pain;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alternative Therapies;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic;Analgesics, Opioid;Benzodiazepine;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Diagnosis;Discharge Planning;Electronic Health Records;Female;Forecasting;Future;Hospital Medicine;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Index;Logistic Regression;Male;Mental Health;Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Morphine;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patient Discharge;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Prescriptions;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Safety-net Hospitals;Sensitivity and Specificity;Supplies;Therapeutics;Tobacco Use Disorder;Young Adult",Acute Pain;Chronic Pain;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Tobacco Use Disorder,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

29933819,2018,Preventing Opioid Overdose in the Clinic and Hospital: Analgesia and Opioid Antagonists.,"Drawing from existing opioid prescribing guidelines, this article describes how medical providers can reduce the risk of overdose. Through primary prevention, providers can prevent initial exposure and associated risks by educating patients, using risk stratification, minimizing opioid dose and duration, and avoiding coprescribing with sedatives. Secondary prevention efforts include monitoring patients with urine toxicology and prescription monitoring programs, and screening for opioid use disorders. Tertiary prevention includes treating opioid use disorders and providing naloxone to prevent overdose death. Specific preventive strategies may be required for those with psychiatric disorders or substance use disorders, adolescents, the elderly, and pregnant women.","Adolescent;Aged;Analgesia;Analgesics, Opioid;Death;Drawing;Drug Overdose;Education;Guideline;Harm Reduction;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Hospitals;Humans;Medical History Taking;Mental Disorders;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain Management;Patient Monitoring;Patients;Pregnant Women;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Primary Prevention;Program;Risk;Risk Assessment;Screening;Secondary Prevention;Sedatives;Substance Abuse Detection;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Tertiary Prevention;Toxicology;Urine",Death;Drug Overdose;Mental Disorders;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Abuse;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Med Clin North Am,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
30208470,2018,Receipt of Timely Addiction Treatment and Association of Early Medication Treatment With Retention in Care Among Youths With Opioid Use Disorder.,"Retention in addiction treatment is associated with reduced mortality for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Although clinical trials support use of OUD medications among youths (adolescents and young adults), data on timely receipt of buprenorphine hydrochloride, naltrexone hydrochloride, and methadone hydrochloride and its association with retention in care in real-world treatment settings are lacking. To identify the proportion of youths who received treatment for addiction after diagnosis and to determine whether timely receipt of OUD medications is associated with retention in care. This retrospective cohort study used enrollment data and complete health insurance claims of 2.4 million youths aged 13 to 22 years from 11 states enrolled in Medicaid from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2017, to March 15, 2018. Receipt of OUD medication (buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone) within 3 months of diagnosis of OUD compared with receipt of behavioral health services alone. Retention in care, with attrition defined as 60 days or more without any treatment-related claims. Among 4837 youths diagnosed with OUD, 2752 (56.9%) were female and 3677 (76.0%) were non-Hispanic white. Median age was 20 years (interquartile range [IQR], 19-21 years). Overall, 3654 youths (75.5%) received any treatment within 3 months of diagnosis of OUD. Most youths received only behavioral health services (2515 [52.0%]), with fewer receiving OUD medications (1139 [23.5%]). Only 34 of 728 adolescents younger than 18 years (4.7%; 95% CI, 3.1%-6.2%) and 1105 of 4109 young adults age 18 years or older (26.9%; 95% CI, 25.5%-28.2%) received timely OUD medications. Median retention in care among youths who received timely buprenorphine was 123 days (IQR, 33-434 days); naltrexone, 150 days (IQR, 50-670 days); and methadone, 324 days (IQR, 115-670 days) compared with 67 days (IQR, 14-206 days) among youths who received only behavioral health services. Timely receipt of buprenorphine (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52-0.64), naltrexone (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.69), and methadone (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22-0.47) were each independently associated with lower attrition from treatment compared with receipt of behavioral health services alone. Timely receipt of buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone was associated with greater retention in care among youths with OUD compared with behavioral treatment only.

30344005,2018,Use of rapid fentanyl test strips among young adults who use drugs.,"The overdose epidemic has been exacerbated by a dramatic increase in deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Drug checking is a novel strategy to identify IMF in illicit drugs. We examined the uptake and acceptability of rapid fentanyl test strips among young adults. From May to September 2017, we recruited 93 young adults in Rhode Island who reported injecting drugs or using heroin, cocaine, or illicitly obtained prescription pills in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to test either their urine after drug use (post-consumption) or a drug sample prior to use (pre-consumption) using rapid fentanyl test strips. After a questionnaire and a brief training, participants received ten strips for their personal use and were asked to return for a one-month follow-up visit, which assessed the uptake and acceptability of the rapid strips tests and the behavioral outcomes associated with receipt of a positive test. Of the 81 (87%) participants who returned for follow-up and who had complete data, the mean age was 27, 45 (56%) were male, and 37 (46%) were non-white. A total of 62 participants (77%) reported using at least one test strip. Of these, 31 (50%) received at least one positive result. A positive result was associated with older age, homelessness, heroin use, injection drug use, ever witnessing an overdose, and concern about overdose or drugs being laced with fentanyl (all p &lt; 0.05). Receiving a positive result was significantly associated with reporting a positive change in overdose risk behavior between baseline and follow-up (p ≤  0.01). Among all participants, 79 (98%) reported confidence in their ability to use the test strips and 77 (95%) wanted to use them in the future. Young adults reported high uptake and acceptability of fentanyl test strips to detect IMF in illicit drugs.","Ability;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Cocaine;Consumption;Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Female;Fentanyl;Future;Harm Reduction;Heroin;Homelessness;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Injections;Male;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Questionnaires;Reagent Strips;Rhode Island;Risk Behavior;Risk-Taking;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Surveys and Questionnaires;Urine;Whites;Young Adult","Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

30391835,2019,Non-fatal opioid-related overdoses among adolescents in Massachusetts 2012-2014.,"Opioid-related overdoses and deaths among adolescents in the United States continue to increase, but little is known about adolescents who experience opioid-related non-fatal overdose (NFOD). Our objective was to describe (1) the characteristics of adolescents aged 11-17 who experienced NFOD and (2) their receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the 12 months following NFOD, compared with adults. We created a retrospective cohort using six Massachusetts state agency datasets linked at the individual level, with information on 98% of state residents. Individuals entered the cohort if they experienced NFOD between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. We compared adolescents to adults experiencing NFOD, examining individual characteristics and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Among 22,506 individuals who experienced NFOD during the study period, 195 (0.9%) were aged 11-17. Fifty-two percent (102/195) of adolescents were female, whereas only 38% of adults were female (P &lt; 0.001). In the year prior to NFOD, 11% (21/195) of adolescents received a prescription opioid, compared to 43% of adults (P &lt; 0.001), and &lt;5% (&lt;10/195) received any MOUD compared to 23% of adults (P &lt; 0.001). In the 12 months after NFOD, only 8% (15/195) of adolescents received MOUD, compared to 29% of adults. Among individuals experiencing NFOD, adolescents were more likely to be female and less likely to have been prescribed opioids in the year prior. Few adolescents received MOUD before or after NFOD.

30471102,2019,"Effect of Age on Opioid Prescribing, Overdose, and Mortality in Massachusetts, 2011 to 2015.","To examine the effect of age on the likelihood of PIP of opioids and the effect of PIP on adverse outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Data from multiple state agencies in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2015. Adult Massachusetts residents (N=3,078,163) who received at least one prescription opioid during the study period; approximately half (1,589,365) aged 50 and older. We measured exposure to 5 types of PIP: high-dose opioids, coprescription with benzodiazepines, multiple opioid prescribers, multiple opioid pharmacies, and continuous opioid therapy without a pain diagnosis. We examined 3 adverse outcomes: nonfatal opioid overdose, fatal opioid overdose, and all-cause mortality. The rate of any PIP increased with age, from 2% of individuals age 18 to 29 to 14% of those aged 50 and older. Older adults also had higher rates of exposure to 2 or more different types of PIP (40-49, 2.5%; 50-69, 5%; ≥70, 4%). Of covariates assessed, older age was the greatest predictor of PIP. In analyses stratified according to age, any PIP and specific types of PIP were associated with nonfatal overdose, fatal overdose, and all-cause mortality in younger and older adults. Older adults are more likely to be exposed to PIP, which increases their risk of adverse events. Strategies to reduce exposure to PIP and to improve outcomes in those already exposed will be instrumental to addressing the opioid crisis in older adults.

Data are needed to inform a public health approach to the opioid epidemic. To examine the association between various levels of opioid use in the past year and physical and mental health, co-occurring substance use, and involvement in the criminal justice system. This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis used the 2015-2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to assess the independent association of intensity of opioid use with health, co-occurring substance use, and involvement in the criminal justice system among US adults aged 18 to 64 years using multivariable logistic regression. No opioid use vs prescription opioid use, misuse, or use disorder or heroin use. Self-reported physical and mental health, disability, co-occurring substance use, and past year and lifetime involvement in the criminal justice system. The sample consisted of 78 976 respondents (42 495 women and 36 481 men), representative of 196 280 447 US adults. In the weighted sample, 124 026 842 adults reported no opioid use in the past year (63.2%; 95% CI, 62.6%-63.7%), 61 462 897 reported prescription opioid use in the past year (31.3%; 95% CI, 30.8%-31.8%), 8 439 889 reported prescription opioid misuse in the past year (4.3%; 95% CI, 4.1%-4.5%), 1 475 433 reported prescription opioid use disorder in the past year (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.7%-0.8%), and 875 386 reported heroin use in the past year (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.4%-0.5%). Individuals who reported any level of opioid use were significantly more likely than individuals who reported no opioid use to be white, have a low income, and report a chronic condition, disability, severe mental illness, or co-occurring drug use. History of involvement in the criminal justice system increased as intensity of opioid use increased (no use, 15.9% [19 562 158 of 123 319 911]; 95% CI, 15.4%-16.4%; prescription opioid use, 22.4% [13 712 162 of 61 204 541]; 95% CI, 21.7%-23.1%; prescription opioid misuse, 33.2% [2 793 391 of 8 410 638]; 95% CI, 30.9%-35.6%; prescription opioid use disorder, 51.7% [762 189 of 1 473 552]; 95% CI, 45.4%-58.0%; and heroin use, 76.8% [668 453 of 870 250]; 95% CI, 70.6%-82.1%).

30657529,2019,Association of Pharmaceutical Industry Marketing of Opioid Products With Mortality From Opioid-Related Overdoses.,"Prescription opioids are involved in 40% of all deaths from opioid overdose in the United States and are commonly the first opioids encountered by individuals with opioid use disorder. It is unclear whether the pharmaceutical industry marketing of opioids to physicians is associated with mortality from overdoses. To identify the association between direct-to-physician marketing of opioid products by pharmaceutical companies and mortality from prescription opioid overdoses across US counties. This population-based, county-level analysis of industry marketing information used data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Open Payments database linked with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on opioid prescribing and mortality from overdoses. All US counties were included, with data on overdoses from August 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, linked to marketing data from August 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, using a 1-year lag. Statistical analyses were conducted between February 1 and June 1, 2018. County-level mortality from prescription opioid overdoses, total cost of marketing of opioid products to physicians, number of marketing interactions, opioid prescribing rates, and sociodemographic factors. Between August 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, there were 434 754 payments totaling $39.7 million in nonresearch-based opioid marketing distributed to 67 507 physicians across 2208 US counties. After adjustment for county-level sociodemographic factors, mortality from opioid overdoses increased with each 1-SD increase in marketing value in dollars per capita (adjusted relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12), number of payments to physicians per capita (adjusted relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.14-1.21, and number of physicians receiving marketing per capita (adjusted relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16). Opioid prescribing rates also increased with marketing and partially mediated the association between marketing and mortality. In this study, across US counties, marketing of opioid products to physicians was associated with increased opioid prescribing and, subsequently, with elevated mortality from overdoses. Amid a national opioid overdose crisis, reexamining the influence of the pharmaceutical industry may be warranted.","Adjustment;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.;Correlation of Data;Cost;Database;Death;Drug Industry;Drug Overdose;Female;Humans;Industry;Male;Marketing;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Relative Risk;Risk Assessment;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
30875477,2019,Development and evaluation of a standardized research definition for opioid overdose outcomes.,"Background: Increasing epidemiologic and intervention research is being conducted on opioid overdose, a serious and potentially fatal outcome. However, there is little consensus on how to verify opioid overdose outcomes for research purposes. To ensure reproducibility, minimize misclassification, and permit data harmonization across studies, standardized and consistent overdose definitions are needed. The aims were to develop a case criteria classification scheme based on information commonly available in medical records and to compare it with reviewing physician clinical impression and simple encounter documentation. Methods: In 2 large health systems, we developed a case criteria classification scheme for opioid overdose based on prior literature, expert opinion, and pilot testing with sample medical records. We then identified emergency department and hospital encounters (n = 259) with at least 1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code representing a broad range of opioid and non-opioid related poisonings. Physicians conducted structured medical record reviews to identify the proposed case criteria and generate a clinical impression, and trained abstractors verified documentation. We then compared the case criteria classification scheme with clinical impression and encounter documentation. Results: We developed a quantitative opioid overdose case criteria classification scheme that included 3 sets of major criteria and 9 minor criteria (supporting documentation). For the encounters identified using poisoning codes, the proportion verified as opioid overdoses using the case criteria classification scheme, clinical impression, and encounter documentation ranged from 50.4% to 52.7% at one site and 55.5% to 67.2% at the second site. Discrepancies across approaches and sites related to differences in available records and documentation of clinical signs of overdose. Conclusions: We propose a novel case criteria classification scheme for opioid overdose that could be used to rigorously and consistently define overdose across multiple research settings. However, prior to widespread use, further refinement and validation are needed.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Classification;Consensus;Documentation;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Epidemiology;Expert Opinion;Fatal Outcome;Female;Health;Heroin;Hospitals;Humans;ICD-9-CM;International Classification of Diseases;Literature;Male;Medical Records;Methods;Middle Aged;Minors;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Permits;Physicians;Pilots;Poisoning;Records;Reproducibility of Results;Research;Retrospective Studies;Review;Terminology as Topic",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Poisoning,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31082666,2019,Overdose following initiation of naltrexone and buprenorphine medication treatment for opioid use disorder in a United States commercially insured cohort.,"Despite the growing opioid overdose crisis, medication treatment for opioid use disorder remains uncommon. The comparative effectiveness of buprenorphine and naltrexone treatment in reducing overdose and the comparative risks of discontinuing treatment in the real world, remain uncertain. Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of medications for opioid use disorder in preventing opioid-related overdose. Retrospective cohort study SETTING: United States. 46,846 commercially insured individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder and initiating medication treatment between 2010 and 2016. Opioid-related overdose identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions. In our sample, 1386 individuals were prescribed extended-release injectable naltrexone (median filled prescriptions = 9 months), 7782 were prescribed oral naltrexone (5 months), and 40,441 were prescribed buprenorphine (19 months) at least once during follow-up. Individuals receiving buprenorphine therapy were at significantly reduced risk of opioid-related overdose compared to no treatment (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI 0.35-0.46), while a significant association was not observed in extended-release injectable (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.31) or oral (HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.71-1.22) naltrexone. We found no association with opioid overdose within four weeks of discontinuation of any medication. Among commercially-insured patients who initiate medications for opioid use disorder, buprenorphine, but not naltrexone, was associated with lower risk of overdose during active treatment compared to post-discontinuation. More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks unique to each treatment option to better tailor therapies to patients with opioid use disorder.","Adult;Association;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Delayed-Action Preparations;Drug Overdose;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Injectables;Insurance, Health;International Classification of Diseases;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Prescriptions;Research;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risks and Benefits;Therapeutics;United States;Young Adult",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31200278,2019,"Sexual minority disparities in opioid misuse, perceived heroin risk and heroin access among a national sample of US adults.","Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults have elevated use of many substances compared to heterosexual adults, yet LGB disparities in specific types of opioid misuse and perceived opioid risk have not been fully characterized. Data on 126,463 adults (including 8241 LGB adults) were from the 2015-2017 National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression was used to estimate lesbian/gay (L/G) and bisexual disparities (relative to same-gender heterosexuals) for: lifetime prescription pain reliever misuse, heroin use and injection heroin use; past-year opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD); and perceived risk of and access to heroin. All LGB subgroups had elevated lifetime pain reliever misuse rates relative to same-gender heterosexuals. Lifetime heroin use was elevated among LGB women and bisexual men; bisexual women had 4 times the odds of injection heroin use. LGB women and gay men had 1.4-2.4 times the odds of past-year opioid misuse; bisexual women had 2.5 times the odds of OUD. LGB women reported both lower perceived risk of trying heroin and greater perceived heroin access. Lifetime and past-year opioid misuse is elevated among LGB adults. Bisexual women are particularly at-risk, uniquely exhibiting disparities on high-risk injection use and OUD. Lower perceived risk of and greater access to heroin among LGB women may play a role in the onset or continuation of opioid misuse. Opioid misuse disparities among LGB adults are of substantial concern given the resultant elevated risk for fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Bisexuality;Bisexuals;Female;Gays;Gender;Health;Heroin;Heroin Dependence;Heterosexuals;Homosexuality, Female;Homosexuality, Male;Humans;Injections;Lesbians;Logistic Regression;Male;Men;Middle Aged;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Prescription Drug Diversion;Prescriptions;Relatives;Risk;Role;Sexual and Gender Minorities;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Surveys;Time;United States;Women;Young Adult","Heroin Dependence;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Pain;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31361589,2020,Who receives naloxone from emergency medical services? Characteristics of calls and recent trends.,"Background: With the rapid rise in opioid overdose-related deaths, state policy makers have expanded policies to increase the use of naloxone by emergency medical services (EMS). However, little is known about changes in EMS naloxone administration in the context of continued worsening of the opioid crisis and efforts to increase use of naloxone. This study examines trends in patient demographics and EMS response characteristics over time and by county urbanicity. Methods: We used data from the 2013-2016 National EMS Information System to examine trends in patient demographics and EMS response characteristics for 911-initiated incidents that resulted in EMS naloxone administration. We also assessed temporal, regional, and urban-rural variation in per capita rates of EMS naloxone administrations compared with per capita rates of opioid-related overdose deaths. Results: From 2013 to 2016, naloxone administrations increasingly involved young adults and occurred in public settings. Particularly in urban counties, there were modest but significant increases in the percentage of individuals who refused subsequent treatment, were treated and released, and received multiple administrations of naloxone before and after arrival of EMS personnel. Over the 4-year period, EMS naloxone administrations per capita increased at a faster rate than opioid-related overdose deaths across urban, suburban, and rural counties. Although national rates of naloxone administration were consistently higher in suburban counties, these trends varied across U.S. Census Regions, with the highest rates of suburban administration occurring in the South. Conclusions: Naloxone administration rates increased more quickly than opioid deaths across all levels of county urbanicity, but increases in the percentage of individuals requiring multiple doses and refusing subsequent care require further attention.",Administration;Adult;Attention;Censuses;Death;Demography;Drug Overdose;Emergency Medical Services;Female;Humans;Information Systems;Male;Methods;Middle Aged;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Occupational Groups;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Patient Transfer;Patients;Policy;Policy Makers;Rural Population;Suburban Population;Therapeutics;Time;Transportation of Patients;Treatment Refusal;Urban Population;Young Adult,Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31372990,2019,"Prescription drug monitoring programs: Assessing the association between ""best practices"" and opioid use in Medicare.","To estimate the impact of implementing prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) best practices on prescription opioid use. 2007-2012 Medicare claims for noncancer pain patients, and PDMP attributes from the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System. We derived PDMP composite scores using the number of best practices adopted by states (range: 0-14), classifying states as either no PDMP, low strength (0 &lt; score &lt; median), or high strength (score ≥ median). Using generalized linear models, we quantified the association between the PDMP score category and opioid use measures-overall and stratified by disability/age. Sensitivity analyses assessed the general Medicare sample regardless of pain diagnoses, individual PDMP characteristics, and compared GEE model findings to models with state fixed effects. Compared to non-PDMP states, strong PDMP states had lower opioid cumulative doses (-296 mg; 95% CI: -512, -132), days supplied (-7.84; 95% CI: -10.6, -5.04), prescription fill rates (0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.98), and mean daily doses (-2.31 mg; 95% CI: -3.14, -1.48) but greater prevalence of high opioid doses in disabled adults, whereas there was little or no change in older adults. Findings in states with weak PDMPs were substantively similar to those of strong PDMPs. Results from sensitivity analyses were mostly consistent with main findings except there was a null relationship with mean daily doses and high doses in models with state fixed effects. Comprehensive or minimal adoption of PDMP best practices was associated with mostly comparable effects on Medicare beneficiaries' opioid use; however, these effects were concentrated among nonelderly disabled adults.","Adoption;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Best Practices;Diagnosis;Drug Utilization;Female;Health Policy;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Measures;Medicare;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain;Patients;Policy;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Prescription Drug Abuse;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Sensitivity;United States",Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Prescription Drug Abuse,Health Serv Res,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31627159,2019,Prescription drug monitoring programs operational characteristics and fatal heroin poisoning.,"Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), by reducing access to prescribed opioids (POs), may contribute to a policy environment in which some people with opioid dependence are at increased risk for transitioning from POs to heroin/other illegal opioids. This study examines how PDMP adoption and changes in the characteristics of PDMPs over time contribute to changes in fatal heroin poisoning in counties within states from 2002 to 2016. Latent transition analysis to classify PDMPs into latent classes (Cooperative, Proactive, and Weak) for each state and year, across three intervals (1999-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2016). We examined the association between probability of PDMP latent class membership and the rate of county-level heroin poisoning death. After adjustment for potential county-level confounders and co-occurring policy changes, adoption of a PDMP was significantly associated with increased heroin poisoning rates (22% increase by third year post-adoption). Findings varied by PDMP type. From 2010-2016, states with Cooperative PDMPs (those more likely to share data with other states, to require more frequent reporting, and include more drug schedules) had 19% higher heroin poisoning rates than states with Weak PDMPs (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.14, 1.25). States with Proactive PDMPs (those more likely to report outlying prescribing and dispensing and provide broader access to law enforcement) had 6% lower heroin poisoning rates than states with No/Weak PDMPs (ARR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90, 0.98). There is a consistent, positive association between state PDMP adoption and heroin poisoning mortality. However, this varies by PDMP type, with Proactive PDMPs associated with a small reduction in heroin poisoning deaths. This raises questions about the potential for PDMPs to support efforts to decrease heroin overdose risk, particularly by using proactive alerts to identify patients in need of treatment for opioid use disorder. Future research on mechanisms explaining the reduction in heroin poisonings after enactment of Proactive PDMPs is merited.","Adjustment;Adoption;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Death;Drug Overdose;Environment;Female;Future;Heroin;Heroin Dependence;Humans;Law Enforcement;Male;Mortality;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Poisoning;Policy;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Probability;Report;Research;Risk;Schedules;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Heroin Dependence;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Poisoning,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31637652,2020,An Observational Study of Retail Pharmacy Naloxone Prescriptions: Differences Across Provider Specialties and Patient Populations.,"Despite exponential growth in pharmacy-dispensed naloxone, little information is available regarding variation in naloxone prescribing pattern across specialty groups, regions, and patient populations. Explore variation in pharmacy-dispensed naloxone by prescriber specialty and patient characteristics. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2016 national retail pharmacy naloxone prescription claims from the IQVIA Real Longitudinal Prescriptions database. Naloxone prescribers and individuals filling naloxone prescriptions. Descriptive statistics assess differences across prescriber specialty groups in number of naloxone prescribers, patient and prescription characteristics, and geographic variation in naloxone dispensation and naloxone market share across prescriber specialty groups or formulation. In 2016, 100,958 naloxone prescriptions written by 14,026 prescribers were filled by 88,735 patients. Primary care physicians accounted for the largest share of naloxone prescribers (45.9%); pain and anesthesia physicians and non-physicians prescribed to significantly greater numbers of patients (means of 10 and 8, respectively). While responsible for a relatively small share of naloxone dispensed (6.1%), psychiatrists and addiction specialists disproportionately served younger individuals, accounting for 49.5% of all prescriptions for individuals aged 35 and younger. Naloxone fill rates differed greatly across geographic regions, with the highest per capita rates in New England and the most concentrated prescribing in the West South Central and South Atlantic regions, where naloxone prescribers had the highest average numbers of patients (9.7 and 7.9, respectively). The South Atlantic and West South Central also had naloxone markets dominated by the Evzio® auto-injector, responsible for 50.3% and 43.8% of all naloxone dispensed in the regions; in contrast, New England's naloxone market was predominantly comprised of generic formulations (48.8%) and Narcan® nasal spray (45.4%). Our findings reflect a need to better understand barriers to uptake of naloxone prescribing behavior among physicians and other prescribers to ensure individuals have adequate opportunity to receive naloxone from their treating clinicians.","Accounting;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Anesthesia;Behavior;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Drug Prescriptions;Growth;Humans;Naloxone;Narcan;Nasal Sprays;Needs;New England;Observational Study;Pain;Patients;Pharmacy;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Psychiatrists;Specialists;Statistics",Pain,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
31792871,2020,Heterogeneity in Prescription Opioid Pain Reliever Misuse Across Age Groups: 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.,"Prescription opioid misuse among older adults has received little attention to date. Potential age variation in characteristics of and motivations for prescription opioid misuse has not been fully characterized yet has important implications for preventing diversion and misuse. To examine (1) age-specific patterns of source of misused prescription opioid pain relievers and motives for misuse and (2) age-specific and source-specific associations with opioid use disorder (OUD), heroin use, benzodiazepine misuse, and OUD treatment utilization. Cross-sectional study using 3 waves (2015-2017) of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (68% average response rate) PARTICIPANTS: Respondents aged 12 and older with past-year prescription opioid pain reliever misuse (n = 8228) MAIN MEASURES: Source for the most-recently misused prescription pain reliever (categorized as medical, social, or illicit/other), motive for last episode of misuse, OUD, heroin use, benzodiazepine misuse, and OUD treatment. Adults 50 and older comprised approximately 25% of all individuals reporting past-year prescription opioid misuse. A social source was most common for individuals under age 50 while a medical source was most common for individuals 50 and older. The most commonly reported motive for misuse was to ""relieve physical pain""; the frequency of this response increased across age groups (47% aged 12-17 to 87% aged 65+). Among adults age 50 and older with prescription opioid misuse, 17% met criteria for OUD, 15% reported past-year benzodiazepine misuse, and 3% reported past-year heroin use. Physicians continue to be a direct source of prescription opioids for misuse, particularly for older adults. Ongoing clinical initiatives regarding optimal opioid prescribing practices are needed in addition to effective non-opioid strategies for pain management. Clinical initiatives should also include screening adult and adolescent patients for non-medical use of prescription opioids as well as improving access to OUD treatment for individuals of all ages.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Attention;Benzodiazepine;Child;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dates;Health;Heroin;Humans;Middle Aged;Motivation;Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Prescriptions;Respondents;Screening;Surveys;Therapeutics",Opioid Misuse;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Prescription Opioid Misuse,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

31905233,2020,Receipt of Addiction Treatment After Opioid Overdose Among Medicaid-Enrolled Adolescents and Young Adults.,"Nonfatal opioid overdose may be a critical touch point when youths who have never received a diagnosis of opioid use disorder can be engaged in treatment. However, the extent to which youths (adolescents and young adults) receive timely evidence-based treatment following opioid overdose is unknown. To identify characteristics of youths who experience nonfatal overdose with heroin or other opioids and to assess the percentage of youths receiving timely evidence-based treatment. This retrospective cohort study used the 2009-2015 Truven-IBM Watson Health MarketScan Medicaid claims database from 16 deidentified states representing all US census regions. Data from 4 039 216 Medicaid-enrolled youths aged 13 to 22 years were included and were analyzed from April 20, 2018, to March 21, 2019. Nonfatal incident and recurrent opioid overdoses involving heroin or other opioids. Receipt of timely addiction treatment (defined as a claim for behavioral health services, for buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone prescription or administration, or for both behavioral health services and pharmacotherapy within 30 days of incident overdose). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with receipt of timely treatment as well as with incident and recurrent overdoses were also identified. Among 3791 youths with nonfatal opioid overdose, 2234 (58.9%) were female, and 2491 (65.7%) were non-Hispanic white. The median age was 18 years (interquartile range, 16-20 years). The crude incident opioid overdose rate was 44.1 per 100 000 person-years. Of these 3791 youths, 1001 (26.4%) experienced a heroin overdose; the 2790 (73.6%) remaining youths experienced an overdose involving other opioids. The risk of recurrent overdose among youths with incident heroin involvement was significantly higher than that among youths with other opioid overdose (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.14-3.22), and youths with incident heroin overdose experienced recurrent overdose at a crude rate of 20 700 per 100 000 person-years. Of 3606 youths with opioid-related overdose and continuous enrollment for at least 30 days after overdose, 2483 (68.9%) received no addiction treatment within 30 days after incident opioid overdose, whereas only 1056 youths (29.3%) received behavioral health services alone, and 67 youths (1.9%) received pharmacotherapy. Youths with heroin overdose were significantly less likely than youths with other opioid overdose to receive any treatment after their overdose (adjusted odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.83). After opioid overdose, less than one-third of youths received timely addiction treatment, and only 1 in 54 youths received recommended evidence-based pharmacotherapy.

31960025,2021,Outcomes Associated With Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Among Persons Hospitalized for Infective Endocarditis.,"Endocarditis, once predominately found in older adults, is increasingly common among younger persons who inject drugs. Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) complicates endocarditis management. We aimed to determine if rates of overdose and rehospitalization differ between persons with OUD with endocarditis who are initiated on medications for OUD (MOUDs) within 30 days of hospital discharge and those who are not. We performed a retrospective cohort study using a large commercial health insurance claims database of persons ≥18 years between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2016. Primary outcomes included opioid-related overdoses and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization. We calculated incidence rates for the primary outcomes and developed Cox hazards models to predict time from discharge to each primary outcome as a function of receipt of MOUDs. The cohort included 768 individuals (mean age 39 years, 51% male). Only 5.7% of people received MOUDs in the 30 days following hospitalization. The opioid-related overdose rate among those who did receive MOUDs in the 30 days following hospitalization was lower than among those who did not (5.8 per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1-6.4] vs 7.3 per 100-person years [95% CI, 7.1-7.5], respectively). The rate of 1-year rehospitalization among those who received MOUDs was also lower than those who did not (162.0 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 157.4-166.6] vs 255.4 per 100 person-years [95% CI, 254.0-256.8], respectively). In the Cox hazards models, the receipt of MOUDs was not associated with either of the outcomes.

To determine HCV testing proportion and factors associated with treatment initiation, and treatment outcomes in a large sample of FQHCs around the U.S. Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records of three hundred and forty-one FQHC clinical sites participating in the OCHIN network in 19 U.S. states. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) seen between January 01, 2012, and June 30, 2017. HCV testing proportion, stratified by diagnosis of opioid use disorder (OUD); treatment initiation rates; and sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 6 months after treatment initiation. Of the 1,508,525 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 88,384 (5.9%) were tested for HCV, and 8694 (9.8%) of individuals tested had reactive results. Of the 6357 with HCV RNA testing, 4092 (64.4%) had detectable RNA. Twelve percent of individuals with chronic HCV and evaluable data initiated treatment. Of those, 87% reached SVR. Having commercial insurance (aOR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.46-3.05), older age (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09), and being Hispanic/Latino (aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.38-2.53) or Asian/Pacific Islander (aOR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.46-4.19) were independently associated with higher odds of treatment initiation after multivariable adjustment. In contrast, women (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97) and the uninsured (aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.25) were less likely to initiate treatment. Only 8% of individuals with chronic HCV were tested for HIV, and 15% of individuals with identified OUD were tested for HCV. Fewer than 20% of individuals with identified OUD were tested for HCV. SVR was lower than findings in other real-world cohorts. Measures to improve outcomes should be considered with the expansion of HCV management into community clinics.","Adjustment;Adult;Aftercare;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Antiviral Agents;Asians;Cohort Studies;Community;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Female;HIV;Health;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Hepatitis C, Chronic;Hispanics;Humans;Infections;Insurance;Latinos;Measures;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Patients;RNA;Retrospective Studies;Sustained Virologic Response;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Uninsured;United States;Women","Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C, Chronic;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder",J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32219404,2020,Association of Opioids Prescribed to Family Members With Opioid Overdose Among Adolescents and Young Adults.,"Family members are cited as a common source of prescription opioids used for nonmedical reasons. However, the overdose risk associated with exposure to opioids prescribed to family members among adolescents and young adults is not well established. To assess the association of opioids prescribed to family members with pharmaceutical opioid overdose among youth. This cohort study included 45 145 family units with a total of 72 040 adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 26 years enrolled in a Kaiser Permanente Colorado health plan in 2006 and observed through June 2018. Opioid prescriptions and dosage dispensed to family members and youth in the past month. Fatal pharmaceutical opioid overdoses identified in vital records and nonfatal pharmaceutical opioid overdoses identified in emergency department and inpatient settings. Time to first overdose was modeled using Cox regression. The study population consisted of 72 040 adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age across follow-up, 19.3 [3.7] years; 36 646 [50.9%] girls and women) nested in 45 145 family units. Youth were more commonly exposed to prescription opioids dispensed to a family member than through their own prescriptions. During follow-up, 26 284 youth (36.5%) filled at least 1 opioid prescription, and 47 461 youth (65.9%) had at least 1 family member with a prescription. Exposure to family members with opioid prescriptions in the past month was associated with increased risk of pharmaceutical opioid overdose (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.24-3.79) independent of opioids prescribed to youth (aHR, 6.62; 95% CI, 3.39-12.91). Concurrent exposure to opioid prescriptions from youth and family members was associated with substantially increased overdose risk (aHR, 12.99; 95% CI, 5.08-33.25). High dosage of total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed to family members in the past month was associated with youth overdose (0 MME vs &gt;0 to &lt;200 MME: aHR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.51-3.81; 0 MME vs 200 to &lt;600 MME: aHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.59-3.77; 0 MME vs ≥600 MME: aHR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.55-5.56). In this study of youth linked to family members, exposure to family members' prescribed opioids was associated with increased risk of pharmaceutical opioid overdose, independent of opioids prescribed to youth. Further interventions targeting youth and families are needed, including counseling patients about the risks of opioids to youth in their families.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Child;Cohort Studies;Colorado;Counseling;Drug Overdose;Emergency Service, Hospital;Family;Family Members;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Health;Humans;Incidence;Inpatients;Male;Morphine;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Records;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Substance-Related Disorders;Time;Women;Young Adult;Youth",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Substance-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32267585,2020,The association of criminal justice supervision setting with overdose mortality: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Despite the high prevalence of substance use among people in the US criminal justice system, little is known about the incidence of overdose mortality by use patterns, drug convictions and supervision setting. We examined the associations between these characteristics and overdose mortality. Retrospective cohort study. Individuals sentenced to prison, jail, probation or jail plus probation for a felony conviction in Michigan, USA from 2003 to 2006. Using the National Death Index, we assessed overdose mortality to December 2012. We calculated overdose mortality rates by pre-sentence opioid use, drug convictions and supervision setting. Multivariable analyses were conducted using competing risks regression with time-varying covariates. Among 140 266 individuals followed over a mean of 7.84 years [standard deviation (SD) = 1.52], 14.9% of the 1131 deaths were due to overdose (102.8 per 100 000 person-years). Over the follow-up, more than half of overdose deaths occurred in the community (57.7%), nearly a third (28.8%) on probation and 12.8% on parole. The adjusted risk of overdose death was lower on probation [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60, 0.85] than in the community without probation or parole (HR = 1.00) but not significantly different on parole (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.87, 1.47). Pre-sentence daily opioid use (HR = 3.54, 95% CI = 3.24, 3.87) was associated with an increased risk. Drug possession (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.93, 1.31) and delivery convictions (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.77, 1.09) were not significantly associated with overdose mortality. Based on the absolute or relative risk, parole, probation and community settings are appropriate settings for enhanced overdose prevention interventions. Ensuring that individuals with pre-sentence opioid use have access to harm reduction and drug treatment services may help to prevent overdose among people involved with the criminal justice system.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Association;Cohort Studies;Community;Confidence Intervals;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Death;Death Rate;Drug Overdose;Epidemiology;Female;Harm Reduction;Humans;Incidence;Index;Jails;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Michigan;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevalence;Prisoners;Prisons;Relative Risk;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Standards;Substance Use;Supervision;Therapeutics;Time;Young Adult",Death;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32320038,2020,Association of Racial/Ethnic Segregation With Treatment Capacity for Opioid Use Disorder in Counties in the United States.,"Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is the current standard of care for opioid use disorder. Given the paucity of research identifying which patients will respond best to which medication, both medications should be accessible to all patients so that patients can determine which works best for them. However, given differences in the historical contexts of their initial implementation, access to each of these medications may vary along racial/ethnic lines. To examine the extent to which capacity to provide methadone and buprenorphine vary with measures of racial/ethnic segregation. This cross-sectional study included all counties and county-equivalent divisions in the US in 2016. Data on racial/ethnic population distribution were derived from the American Community Survey, and data on locations of facilities providing methadone and buprenorphine were obtained from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration databases. Data were analyzed from August 22, 2018, to September 11, 2019. Two county-level measures of racial/ethnic segregation, including dissimilarity (representing the proportion of African American or Hispanic/Latino residents who would need to move census tracts to achieve a uniform spatial distribution of the population by race/ethnicity) and interaction (representing the probability that an African American or Hispanic/Latino resident will interact with a white resident and vice versa, assuming random mixing across census tracts). County-level capacity to provide methadone or buprenorphine, defined as the number of facilities providing a medication per 100 000 population. Among 3142 US counties, there were 1698 facilities providing methadone (0.6 facilities per 100 000 population) and 18 868 facilities providing buprenorphine (5.9 facilities per 100 000 population). Each 1% decrease in probability of interaction of an African American resident with a white resident was associated with 0.6 more facilities providing methadone per 100 000 population. Similarly, each 1% decrease in probability of interaction of a Hispanic/Latino resident with a white resident was associated with 0.3 more facilities providing methadone per 100 000 population. Each 1% decrease in the probability of interaction of a white resident with an African American resident was associated with 8.17 more facilities providing buprenorphine per 100 000 population. Similarly, each 1% decrease in the probability of interaction of a white resident with a Hispanic/Latino resident was associated with 1.61 more facilities providing buprenorphine per 100 000 population. These findings suggest that the racial/ethnic composition of a community was associated with which medications residents would likely be able to access when seeking treatment for opioid use disorder. Reforms to existing regulations governing the provisions of these medications are needed to ensure that both medications are equally accessible to all.",Administration;Adult;African Americans;Association;Buprenorphine;Censuses;Community;Community Surveys;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Ethnic Groups;Health Services Accessibility;Hispanics;Humans;Latinos;Male;Measures;Mental Health Services;Methadone;Narcotic Antagonists;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Population;Population Distribution;Probability;Race Factors;Racial Stocks;Regulation;Research;Social Segregation;Spatial Analysis;Standard of Care;Substance Abuse;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Uniforms;United States;Whites;Work,Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32336560,2020,Adolescent-Serving Addiction Treatment Facilities in the United States and the Availability of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.,"Adolescents with opioid use disorder are less likely than adults to receive medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), yet we know little about facilities that provide addiction treatment for adolescents. We sought to describe adolescent-serving addiction treatment facilities in the U.S. and examine associations between facility characteristics and offering MOUD, leading to informed recommendations to improve treatment access. This cross-sectional study used the 2017 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. Facilities were classified by whether they offered a specialized adolescent program. Covariates included facility ownership, hospital affiliation, insurance/payments, government grants, accreditation/licensure, location, levels of care, and provision of MOUD. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression compared adolescent-serving versus adult-focused facilities and identified characteristics associated with offering maintenance MOUD. Among 13,585 addiction treatment facilities in the U.S., 3,537 (26.0%) offered adolescent programs. Adolescent-serving facilities were half as likely to offer maintenance MOUD as adult-focused facilities (odds ratio, .53; 95% confidence interval, .49-.58), which was offered at 23.1% (816) of adolescent-serving versus 35.9% (3,612) of adult-focused facilities. Among adolescent-serving facilities, characteristics associated with increased unadjusted odds of offering maintenance MOUD were nonprofit status, hospital affiliation, accepting insurance (particularly, private insurance), accreditation, Northeastern location, or offering inpatient services. The one-quarter of U.S. addiction treatment facilities that serve adolescents are half as likely to provide MOUD as adult-focused facilities, which may explain why adolescents are less likely than adults to receive MOUD. Strategies to increase adolescent access to MOUD may consider insurance reforms/incentives, facility accreditation, and geographically targeted funding.","Accreditation;Adolescent;Adolescent Health Services;Adult;Association;Behavior, Addictive;Buprenorphine;Confidence Intervals;Cross-Sectional Studies;Government;Grants;Health Facilities;Hospitals;Humans;Incentives;Inpatients;Insurance;Licensure;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Odds Ratio;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Ownership;Program;Statistics;Substance Abuse;Substance Abuse Treatment Centers;Surveys;Therapeutics;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse,J Adolesc Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32448551,2020,Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Facilities With Programs for Special Populations.,"Special populations, including veterans, pregnant and postpartum women, and adolescents, benefit from opioid use disorder treatment tailored to their specific needs, but access to such services is poorly described. This study identifies the availability of opioid use disorder treatment facilities that use medications and have special programming and contextualizes facilities amid counties' opioid-related overdose mortality. Data were compiled on 15,945 U.S. treatment facilities using medications for opioid use disorder listed in the Behavioral Health Services Treatment Locator in 2018. Facilities with programs tailored to special populations (veterans, pregnant and postpartum women, and adolescents) were identified and geocoded. Counties with such facilities were characterized. Cold spots (county clusters with poor treatment availability) were identified using Getis-Ord Gi* statistics. Data were extracted in October 2018 and analyzed from October 2018 to May 2019. Of all 3,142 U.S. counties, 1,889 (60.1%) had opioid use disorder treatment facilities. Facilities with tailored programs for veterans, pregnant and postpartum women, and adolescents were located in 701 (22.3%), 918 (29.2%), and 1,062 (33.8%) of the counties, respectively. Specific medications provided for opioid use disorder varied, with only a minority of facilities offering methadone (among facilities with tailored programs for veterans, 6.0%; pregnant and postpartum women, 13.2%; adolescents, 1.3%). Many counties reporting opioid-related overdose deaths lacked programs for special populations (veterans, 72.6%; pregnant and postpartum women, 54.8%; adolescents, 30.6%). Cold spots were located throughout the Midwest, U.S. Southeast, and portions of Texas. Facilities using medications for opioid use disorder with tailored programs for veterans, pregnant and postpartum women, and adolescents are limited. There is a need for improved access to evidence-based programs that address the unique treatment needs of special populations.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Cold Temperature;Death;Depression, Postpartum;Female;Health Services;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Male;Methadone;Middle Aged;Midwestern United States;Mortality;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Population;Postpartum Period;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Program;Statistics;Texas;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Veterans;Vulnerable Populations;Young Adult","Death;Depression, Postpartum;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders",Am J Prev Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32533570,2021,Systematic review of the emerging literature on the effectiveness of naloxone access laws in the United States.,"Naloxone access laws (NALs) have been suggested to be an important strategy to reduce opioid-related harm. We describe the evolution of NALs across states and over time and review existing evidence of their overall association with naloxone distribution and opioid overdose as well as the potential effects of specific NAL components. Descriptive analysis of temporal variation in US regional adoption of NAL components, accompanied by a systematic search of 13 databases for studies (published between 2005 and 20 December 2019) assessing the effects of NALs on naloxone distribution or opioid-related health outcomes. Eleven studies, all published since 2018, met inclusion criteria. Study time-frames spanned 1999-2017. Opioid-related overdose mortality, emergency department episodes and naloxone distribution were correlated with the presence of a NAL and, where data were available, NAL components. Existing evidence suggests mixed, but generally beneficial, effects for NALs. Nearly all studies show that NALs, particularly those that permit naloxone distribution without patient-specific prescriptions, are associated with increased naloxone access [incidence rate ratios (IRR) range from 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-1.66 to 7.75, 95% CI = 1.22-49.35] and increased opioid-related emergency department visits (IRR range from 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.20 to 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.29). Most studies show NALs are associated with reduced overdose mortality, although findings vary depending on the specific NAL components and time-period analyzed (IRR range from 0.66, 95% CI = 0.42-0.90 to 1.27, 95% CI = 1.27-1.27). Few studies account for the variation in opioid environments (i.e. illicit versus prescription) or other policy dimensions that may be correlated with outcomes. The existing literature on naloxone access laws in the United States supports beneficial effects for increased naloxone distribution, but provides inconclusive evidence for reduced fatal opioid overdose. Mixed findings may reflect variation in the laws' design and implementation, confounding effects of concurrent policy adoption, or differential effectiveness in light of changing opioid environments.","Adoption;Association;Classification;Confidence Intervals;Database;Drug and Narcotic Control;Emergency Service, Hospital;Environment;Harm Reduction;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Incidence Rate;Law;Light;Literature;Mortality;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Overall;Patients;Permits;Pharmacy;Policy;Prescriptions;Review;Systematic Review;Time;Time Studies;United States",Opiate Overdose,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32557132,2020,Antenatal Admissions Among Women with Opioid-Affected and Non-Opioid-Affected Deliveries.,"(1) To compare the prevalence of antenatal admissions and mean length of stay among women with opioid-affected and non-opioid-affected deliveries; (2) examine predictors of admission; and (3) describe the most common discharge diagnoses in each group. Using data from seven states in the State Inpatient Databases for varying years between 2009 and 2014, delivery hospitalizations among women 18 years of age and older were identified and classified as opioid-affected or non-opioid-affected. Antenatal admissions were linked to deliveries. The antenatal admission ratio and mean length of stay for each group were calculated; the percentage of deliveries in each group with no, any, one, two, or three or more antenatal admissions were compared with t-tests. Logistic regression models estimated odds of any antenatal admission, stratified by opioid-affected and non-opioid-affected deliveries. Frequencies were tabulated for the ten most common discharge diagnoses in each group. Of 2,684,970 deliveries, 14,765 were opioid-affected. Admissions among women with opioid-affected deliveries were more prevalent (26.4 per 100 deliveries) compared to 6.7 among women with non-opioid-affected deliveries and were associated with a 1.5-day longer mean length of stay. The presence of a behavioral health condition was associated with higher odds of antenatal admission in both groups, with a particularly strong association among women with opioid-affected deliveries. Six of the ten most common diagnoses for admissions prior to opioid-affected deliveries were behavioral health-related. These results highlight the importance of addressing the large burden of behavioral health conditions among pregnant women, especially those with opioid dependence and abuse.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Cross-Sectional Studies;Database;Diagnosis;Female;Health;Hospitalization;Humans;Inpatients;Length of Stay;Logistic Regression;Maternal Age;Mental Health;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnant Women;Prenatal Care;Prevalence;Retrospective Studies;Substance Use Disorders;United States;Women",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Use Disorders,Matern Child Health J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32740284,2020,Maternal Consistency in Recalling Prenatal Experiences at 6 Months and 8 Years Postnatal.,"Mothers are known to be reliable reporters of smoking during pregnancy, type of delivery, and birth weight when compared with medical records. Few studies have considered whether the timing of retrospective collection affects the mother's retrospective self-report. We examined the consistency of maternal retrospective recall of prenatal experiences, behaviors, and basic birth outcomes between 6 months and 8 years postpartum. We examined 117 mothers (62% White, 44% living in a committed relationship, median high school education) from the Early Growth and Development Study (EGDS). EGDS is a longitudinal adoption study that includes birth mothers of children born between 2003 and 2009 who were involved in a domestic adoption. Using the modified life history calendar and a pregnancy screener, mothers reported on their prenatal health behaviors, prenatal substance use, and labor and delivery at 6 months and 8 years postpartum. Cohen κ was calculated to examine consistency, and χ tests were used to test differences by parity and maternal education. Mothers' recall was very good for recall of the type of delivery and good for smoking during pregnancy, medicine used for labor induction, and specific medical problems (i.e., pre-eclampsia, sexually transmitted infections, and kidney infections). Recall consistency was poor for illicit drug use, specific prenatal tests performed (i.e., amniocentesis and emergency room visits), and using drugs other than an epidural during delivery. This study provides support for using retrospective collection of maternal self-report on some prenatal experiences up to 8 years postpartum and offers a potential way to more accurately collect self-reported prenatal experiences.","Adoption;Affect;Amniocentesis;Behavior;Birth Weight;Calendar;Child;Collection;Education;Educational Status;Emergency Service, Hospital;Female;Growth and Development;Health Behavior;History;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Infections;Kidney;Labor, Induced;Life;Medical Records;Medicine;Mothers;Parity;Parturition;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Postpartum Period;Pre-Eclampsia;Pregnancy;Retrospective Studies;Schools;Self;Self Report;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Smoking;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders;Whites",Infections;Pre-Eclampsia;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Substance Use;Substance-Related Disorders,J Dev Behav Pediatr,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

32795883,2020,Impact of medications for opioid use disorder among persons hospitalized for drug use-associated skin and soft tissue infections.,"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are common complications of injection drug use. We aimed to determine if rehospitalization and recurrent SSTI differ among persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) hospitalized for SSTI who are initiated on MOUD within 30 days of discharge and those who are not. We performed a retrospective analysis of commercially insured adults aged 18 years and older in the U.S. with OUD and hospitalization for injection-related SSTI from 2010-2017. The primary exposure was initiation of MOUD in the 30 days following hospitalization for SSTI. The primary outcomes included 30-day and 1-year 1) all-cause rehospitalization and 2) recurrent SSTI. We calculated the incidence rates for the two groups: MOUD group and no MOUD group for the primary outcomes. We developed Cox models to determine if rehospitalization and recurrent SSTI differ between the two groups. Only 5.5 % (357/6538) of people received MOUD in the month following their index SSTI hospitalization. 30-day rehospitalization incidence was higher in the MOUD group compared to no MOUD (35.9 vs 27.5 per 100 person-30 days) and one-year SSTI recurrence was lower (10.3 vs 18.7 per 100 person-years). In multivariable modeling, the MOUD group remained at significantly higher risk of 30-day rehospitalization compared to the no MOUD group and at lower risk for one-year SSTI recurrence. MOUD receipt following SSTI hospitalization decreases risk of recurrent SSTI among persons with OUD. Further expansion of these in-hospital services could provide an effective tool in the U.S. response to the opioid epidemic.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cox Models;Female;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Incidence;Incidence Rate;Index;Infections;Injections;Male;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Proportional Hazards Models;Recurrence;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Skin;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous","Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Recurrence;Soft Tissue Infections;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32827044,2020,Modifying and Evaluating the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale for Prescription Opioids: A Pilot Study of the Rx-OOKS.,"To develop a validated instrument that measures knowledge about prescription opioid overdose. Within an integrated health care system, we adapted, piloted, and tested the reliability and predictive validity of a modified Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) instrument specific to prescription opioids (Rx-OOKS) with a patient population prescribed long-term opioid therapy and potentially at risk of opioid overdose. We used an interdisciplinary team approach and patient interviews to adapt the instrument. We then piloted the survey on a patient sample and assessed it using Cronbach's alpha and logistic regression. Rx-OOKS (N = 56) resulted in a three-construct, 25-item instrument. Internal consistency was acceptable for the following constructs: ""signs of an overdose"" (10 items) at α = 0.851, ""action to take with opioid overdose"" (seven items) at α = 0.692, and ""naloxone use knowledge"" (eight items) at α = 0.729. One construct, ""risks of an overdose"" (three items), had an α of 0.365 and was subsequently eliminated from analysis due to poor performance. We conducted logistic regression to determine if any of the constructs was strongly associated with future naloxone receipt. Higher scores on ""actions to take in an overdose"" had nine times the odds of receiving naloxone (odds ratio [OR] = 9.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-57.12); higher ""naloxone use knowledge"" scores were 15.8 times more likely to receive naloxone than those with lower scores (OR = 15.83, 95% CI = 1.68-149.17). The Rx-OOKS survey instrument can reliably measure knowledge about prescription opioid overdose recognition and naloxone use. Further, knowledge about actions to take during an opioid overdose and naloxone use were associated with future receipt of naloxone.","Analgesics, Opioid;Confidence Intervals;Drug Overdose;Future;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Integrated Health Care Systems;Interview;Knowledge;Logistic Regression;Measures;Naloxone;Narcotic Antagonists;Odds Ratio;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Patients;Pilot Projects;Population;Prescriptions;Psychometrics;Reproducibility of Results;Risk;Scales;Surveys;Therapeutics;Time",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders,Pain Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32901815,2021,Long-term Infective Endocarditis Mortality Associated With Injection Opioid Use in the United States: A Modeling Study.,"The expansion of the US opioid epidemic has led to significant increases in infections, such as infective endocarditis (IE), which is tied to injection behaviors. We aimed to estimate the population-level IE mortality rate among people who inject opioids and compare the risk of IE death against the risks of death from other causes. We developed a microsimulation model of the natural history of injection opioid use. We defined injection behavior profiles by both injection frequency and injection techniques. We accounted for competing risks of death and populated the model with primary and published data. We modeled cohorts of 1 million individuals with different injection behavior profiles until age 60 years. We combined model-generated estimates with published data to project the total expected number of IE deaths in the United States by 2030. The probabilities of death from IE by age 60 years for 20-, 30-, and 40-year-old men with high-frequency use with higher infection risk techniques compared to lower risk techniques for IE were 53.8% versus 3.7%, 51.4% versus 3.1%, and 44.5% versus 2.2%, respectively. The predicted population-level attributable fraction of 10-year mortality from IE among all risk groups was 20%. We estimated that approximately 257 800 people are expected to die from IE by 2030. The expected burden of IE among people who inject opioids in the United States is large. Adopting a harm reduction approach, including through expansion of syringe service programs, to address injection behaviors could have a major impact on decreasing the mortality rate associated with the opioid epidemic.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Death;Death Rate;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Harm Reduction;Humans;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Injections;Male;Men;Middle Aged;Mortality;Natural History;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Probability;Program;Risk;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Syringes;United States","Death;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Infections;Infective Endocarditis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",Clin Infect Dis,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32976539,2020,"State-level prescription drug monitoring program mandates and adolescent injection drug use in the United States, 1995-2017: A difference-in-differences analysis.","Prescription opioid misuse is an ongoing crisis and a risk factor for injection drug use (IDU). Few studies have evaluated strategies for preventing opioid or IDU initiation among adolescents. We evaluated changes in the proportion of adolescents reporting IDU before and after prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) mandates were implemented in 18 states compared to 29 states without such mandates. This difference-in-differences analysis used biannual Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) data representative of adolescents 17 to 18 years old across 47 states from 1995 to 2017. We compared changes in adolescent IDU in 18 states with and 29 states without PDMP mandates. Among 331,025 adolescents, 51.7% identified as male, 62.1% as non-Hispanic white, 17.4% as non-Hispanic black, and 14.6% as Hispanic. Overall, 3.5% reported IDU during the 2 years prior to PDMP mandates. In the final multivariable difference-in-differences model, we included individual age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as well as state and year as covariates from the YRBSS. We also included state- and year-specific poverty rates based on US Census Bureau data. Additionally, we controlled for state implementation of (non-mandated) PDMPs before states subsequently implemented mandates and pill mill laws. We conducted several sensitivity analyses, including repeating our main analysis using a logistic, rather than linear, model, and with a lead indicator on PDMP mandate implementation, a lag indicator, and alternative policy implementation dates. PDMP mandates were associated with a 1.5 percentage point reduction (95% CI -2.3 to -0.6 percentage points; p = 0.001) in adolescent IDU, on average over the years following mandate implementation, a relative reduction of 42.9% (95% CI -65.7% to -17.1%). The association of PDMP mandates with this reduction persisted at least 4 years beyond implementation. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main results. Limitations include the multi-stepped causal pathway from PDMP mandate implementation to changes in IDU and the potential for omitted state-level time-varying confounders. Our analysis indicated that PDMP mandates were associated with a reduction in adolescent IDU, providing empirical evidence that such mandates may prevent adolescents from initiating IDU. Policymakers might consider PDMP mandates as a potential strategy for preventing adolescent IDU.","Adolescent;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Blacks;Censuses;Data Analysis;Dates;Ethnic Groups;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Indicators;Injections;Law;Lead;Linear Models;Logistics;Male;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Poverty;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Racial Stocks;Relatives;Risk;Risk Factors;Sensitivity;Sex;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Time;United States;Whites;Youth","Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescription Opioid Misuse;Substance Abuse, Intravenous",PLoS Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33002963,2021,Predicting the Future Course of Opioid Overdose Mortality: An Example From Two US States.,"The rapid growth of opioid abuse and the related mortality across the United States has spurred the development of predictive models for the allocation of public health resources. These models should characterize heterogeneous growth across states using a drug epidemic framework that enables assessments of epidemic onset, rates of growth, and limited capacities for epidemic growth. We used opioid overdose mortality data for 146 North and South Carolina counties from 2001 through 2014 to compare the retrodictive and predictive performance of a logistic growth model that parameterizes onsets, growth, and carrying capacity within a traditional Bayesian Poisson space-time model. In fitting the models to past data, the performance of the logistic growth model was superior to the standard Bayesian Poisson space-time model (deviance information criterion: 8,088 vs. 8,256), with reduced spatial and independent errors. Predictively, the logistic model more accurately estimated fatality rates 1, 2, and 3 years in the future (root mean squared error medians were lower for 95.7% of counties from 2012 to 2014). Capacity limits were higher in counties with greater population size, percent population age 45-64, and percent white population. Epidemic onset was associated with greater same-year and past-year incidence of overdose hospitalizations. Growth in annual rates of opioid fatalities was capacity limited, heterogeneous across counties, and spatially correlated, requiring spatial epidemic models for the accurate and reliable prediction of future outcomes related to opioid abuse. Indicators of risk are identifiable and can be used to predict future mortality outcomes.","Analgesics, Opioid;Bayes Theorem;Carrying Capacity;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Future;Growth;Hospitalization;Humans;Incidence;Indicators;Logistic Models;Logistics;Middle Aged;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Abuse;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Population Size;Public Health;Resources;Risk;South Carolina;Standards;Time;United States;Whites",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Abuse;Opioid-Related Disorders,Epidemiology,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33052402,2020,Association of Treatment With Medications for Opioid Use Disorder With Mortality After Hospitalization for Injection Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis.,"Although hospitalizations for injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) have increased during the opioid crisis, utilization of and mortality associated with receipt of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) after discharge from the hospital among patients with IDU-IE are unknown. To assess the proportion of patients receiving MOUD after hospitalization for IDU-IE and the association of MOUD receipt with mortality. This retrospective cohort study used a population registry with person-level medical claims, prescription monitoring program, mortality, and substance use treatment data from Massachusetts between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015; IDU-IE-related discharges between July 1, 2011, and June, 30, 2015, were analyzed. All Massachusetts residents aged 18 to 64 years with a first hospitalization for IDU-IE were included; IDU-IE was defined as any hospitalization with a diagnosis of endocarditis and at least 1 claim in the prior 6 months for OUD, drug use, or hepatitis C and with 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from November 11, 2018, to June 23, 2020. Receipt of MOUD, defined as any treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, within 3 months after hospital discharge excluding discharge month for IDU-IE. The main outcome was all-cause mortality. The proportion of patients who received MOUD in the 3 months after hospital discharge was calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of MOUD receipt with mortality, adjusting for sex, age, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and homelessness. In the secondary analysis, receipt of MOUD was considered as a monthly time-varying exposure. Of 679 individuals with IDU-IE, 413 (60.8%) were male, the mean (SD) age was 39.2 (12.1) years, 298 (43.9%) were aged 18 to 34 years, 419 (72.3) had mental illness, and 209 (30.8) experienced homelessness. A total of 134 individuals (19.7%) received MOUD in the 3 months before hospitalization and 165 (24.3%) in the 3 months after hospital discharge. Of those who received MOUD after discharge, 112 (67.9%) received buprenorphine. The crude mortality rate was 9.2 deaths per 100 person-years. MOUD receipt within 3 months after discharge was not associated with reduced mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.61-2.72); however, MOUD receipt was associated with reduced mortality in the month that MOUD was received (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.89). In this cohort study, receipt of MOUD was associated with reduced mortality after hospitalization for injection drug use-associated endocarditis only in the month it was received. Efforts to improve MOUD initiation and retention after IDU-IE hospitalization may be beneficial.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Association;Buprenorphine;Cause of Death;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Crude Death Rate;Death;Diagnosis;Drug Users;Endocarditis;Female;Hepatitis C;Homelessness;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Humans;Infective Endocarditis;Injections;Male;Massachusetts;Mental Disorders;Methadone;Middle Aged;Mortality;Naltrexone;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opium Dependence;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs;Program;Proportional Hazards Models;Registries;Retrospective Studies;Sex;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Survival;Therapeutics;Time;Young Adult","Death;Endocarditis;Hepatitis C;Infective Endocarditis;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opium Dependence;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use",JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33127195,2021,A commentary on the impact of COVID-19 on engagement of youth with substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.,"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with substance use disorders (SUD) have low rates of engagement and retention in SUD treatment (Mericle et al., 2015). Engagement and retention refers to treatment attendance and regular communication with providers. The reason for this low rate is multifactorial and includes the stigma surrounding SUD and treatment (Bagley, Hadland, Carney, &amp; Saitz, 2017), and challenges accessing developmentally appropriate treatment (Mericle et al., 2015; Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, &amp; Parthasarathy, 2010). Yet engaging AYA early in their trajectory of substance use offers an invaluable opportunity to minimize the short-term and long-term consequences of use (Compton et al., 2019; Levy, Williams, &amp; Prevention, C. on S. U. A., 2016). As specialists in pediatric addiction, we made significant changes in how we provide care for youth in treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following commentary, we discuss the potential positive and negative impacts of those changes and suggestions for future research.",Adolescent;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Comment;Communication;Comorbidity;Future;Humans;Mental Disorders;Pediatrics;Research;Specialists;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Suggestion;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;Young Adult;Youth,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Mental Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

33320266,2020,Comparison of Rates of Overdose and Hospitalization After Initiation of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder in the Inpatient vs Outpatient Setting.,"Whereas outpatient treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is evidence based, there is a large network of inpatient facilities in the US that are reimbursed by commercial insurers and do not typically offer MOUD. To compare the rates of opioid-related overdose and all-cause hospitalization after outpatient MOUD treatment vs inpatient care. This comparative effectiveness research study used deidentified claims of commercially insured individuals in the US from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, to obtain a sample of 37 090 individuals with opioid use disorder who initiated treatment with inpatient care and/or MOUD. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. To address nonrandom treatment assignment, individuals with opioid use disorder who initiated MOUD or who entered inpatient care were matched 1:1 based on propensity scores. The independent variable of interest was the type of treatment initiated. Individuals could initiate 1 of 5 potential treatments: (1) outpatient MOUD, (2) short-term inpatient care, (3) short-term inpatient care followed by outpatient MOUD within 30 days, (4) long-term inpatient care, or (5) long-term inpatient care followed by outpatient MOUD within 30 days. Opioid-related overdose and all-cause hospitalization at any point within the 12 months after treatment of opioid use disorder. The hazard for each outcome was estimated using a time-to-event Cox proportional hazards regression model. The cohort included 37 090 individuals matched 1:1 between inpatient and outpatient treatment (20 723 [56%] were younger than 30 years; 23 250 [63%] were male). After propensity score matching, compared with the inpatient treatments, initiation of outpatient MOUD alone was followed by the lowest 1-year overdose rate (2.2 [95% CI, 2.0-2.5] per 100 person-years vs 3.5 [95% CI, 2.7-4.4] to 7.0 [95% CI, 4.6-10.7] per 100 person-years) and hospitalization rate (39 [95% CI, 38-40] per 100 person-years vs 57 [95% CI, 54-61] to 74 [95% CI, 73-76] per 100 person-years). Outpatient MOUD was also associated with the lowest hazard of these events compared with inpatient care, which had hazard ratios ranging from 1.71 (95% CI, 1.35-2.17) to 2.67 (95% CI, 1.68-4.23) for overdose and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.23-1.44) to 1.90 (95% CI, 1.83-1.97) for hospitalizations. The results of this comparative effectiveness research study suggest that lower rates of subsequent overdose and hospitalization are associated with outpatient MOUD compared with short- or long-term inpatient care. When patients and clinicians have a choice of treatment, outpatient MOUD treatment may be associated with lower overdose and hospitalization on balance. Future research should assess which patients benefit most from inpatient care and how best to leverage existing inpatient treatment infrastructure.","Address;Adult;Aftercare;Buprenorphine;Comparative Effectiveness Research;Database;Drug Overdose;Female;Future;Hospitalization;Humans;Inpatients;Insurance Carriers;Male;Narcotic Antagonists;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;Outpatients;Patients;Persons;Propensity Score;Research;Therapeutics;Time",Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33386322,2021,Principles of Care for Young Adults With Substance Use Disorders.,"Despite the disproportionate impact of substance use on young adults, as well as their unique developmental circumstances, there has historically been little attention given to the substance use care needs of this population. As a result, there are currently few evidence-based recommendations to guide clinicians in caring for young adults with substance use disorders. The Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center convened an interdisciplinary meeting of experts to establish principles of care to guide the management of young adults with substance use disorders, to help health care organizations establish effective care systems for these patients, and to help guide policy. In this article, we review the care principles and introduce a series of linked articles that go into further details of principles in the domains of evidence-based substance use treatment, family engagement in care, recovery support services, comorbid psychiatric illness, harm reduction, and criminal justice system reform.","Addiction Medicine;Age Factors;Attention;Boston;Caring;Consensus;Criminal Justice;Criminal Law;Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry);Evidence-Based Medicine;Family;Harm Reduction;Health Care;Health Services Accessibility;Human Development;Humans;Mental Disorders;Mental Health Recovery;Needs;Organizations;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patient-Centered Care;Patients;Policy;Population;Review;Standard of Care;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult",Mental Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Pediatrics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33386323,2021,Evidence-Based Treatment of Young Adults With Substance Use Disorders.,"In summarizing the proceedings of a longitudinal meeting of experts in substance use disorders (SUDs) among adolescents and young adults, in this special article, we review principles of care related to SUD treatment of young adults. SUDs are most commonly diagnosed during young adulthood, but most of the evidence guiding the treatment of this population has been obtained from older adult study participants. Extrapolating evidence from older populations, the expert group asserted the following principles for SUD treatment: It is important that clinicians who work with young adults effectively identify and address SUD to avert long-term addiction and its associated adverse health outcomes. Young adults receiving addiction treatment should have access to a broad range of evidence-based assessment, psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments, harm reduction interventions, and recovery services. These evidence-based approaches should be tailored to young adults' needs and provided in the least restrictive environment possible. Young adults should enter care voluntarily; civil commitment to treatment should be a last resort. In many settings, compulsory treatment does not use evidence-based approaches; thus, when treatment is involuntary, it should reflect recognized standards of care. Continuous engagement with young adults, particularly during periods of relapse, should be considered a goal of treatment and can be supported by care that is patient-centered and focused on the young adult's goals. Lastly, substance use treatments for young adults should be held to the same evidence and quality standards as those for other chronic health conditions.",Address;Adolescent;Adult;Consensus Development Conferences as Topic;Continuity of Patient Care;Environment;Evidence-Based Medicine;Goals;Harm Reduction;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Institutionalization;Needs;Needs Assessment;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Patients;Population;Quality Improvement;Quality of Health Care;Recurrence;Relapse;Retention in Care;Review;Standard of Care;Standards;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Work;Young Adult,Recurrence;Relapse;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Pediatrics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

The first is that harm reduction services are critical to keeping young adults alive and healthy and can offer opportunities for future engagement in treatment. Such services therefore should be offered at every opportunity, regardless of an individual's interest or ability to minimize use of substances. The second is that all evidence-based harm reduction strategies available to older adults should be available to young adults and that whenever possible, harm reduction programs should be tailored to young adults and be developmentally appropriate.",Ability;Adolescent;Adult;Consensus Development Conferences as Topic;Evidence-Based Medicine;Future;Harm Reduction;Health Services Accessibility;Health Services Needs and Demand;Humans;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Review;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult,Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Pediatrics,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

33423916,2021,Restrictive opioid prescribing policies and evolving risk environments: A qualitative study of the perspectives of patients who experienced an accidental opioid overdose.,"Despite policy efforts to prevent overdose, accidental overdoses among individuals prescribed opioids continue to occur. Guided by Rhodes' Risk Environment Framework, we examined the unintended consequences of restrictive policies by identifying macro policy and micro-level contextual factors that patients prescribed opioids for pain identified as contributing to overdose events. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 patients prescribed opioids who experienced an accidental opioid overdose between April 2017 and June 2019 in two health systems. We identified three interrelated factors that emerged within an evolving risk environment and may have increased patients' vulnerability for an accidental opioid overdose: desperation from persistent pain and comorbidities; limited knowledge about opioid medication safety and effectiveness; and restrictive opioid prescribing policies that exacerbated stigma, fear and mistrust and prevented open patient-clinician communication. When experiencing persistent pain, patients took matters into their own hands by taking more medications or in different intervals than prescribed, mixing them with other substances, or using illicitly obtained opioids. For some patients, macro-level policies and guidelines designed to reduce opioid overdoses by restricting opioid supply may have paradoxically created a micro-level risk environment that contributed to overdose events in a subset of patients.","Analgesics, Opioid;Communication;Comorbidity;Drug Overdose;Environment;Fear;Guideline;Hand;Health;Humans;Interview;Knowledge;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Policy;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Risk;Safety;Supplies",Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Pain,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33465604,2021,Patients at a drug detoxification center share perspectives on how to increase hepatitis C treatment uptake: A qualitative study.,"The US opioid crisis is associated with a surge in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID), and yet the uptake of HCV curative therapy among PWID is low. To explore potential solutions to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake among individuals at a drug detoxification center. Qualitative study with in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of coded data. Patients (N = 24) had the following characteristics: mean age 37 years; 67 % White, 13 % Black, 8 % Latinx, 4 % Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 8 % other; 71 % with a history of injecting drugs. Most patients with a positive HCV test had not pursued treatment due to few perceived immediate consequences from a positive test and possible complications arising in a distant poorly imagined future. Active substance use was a major barrier to HCV treatment uptake because of disruptions to routine activities. In addition, re-infection after treatment was perceived as inevitable. Patients had suggestions to improve HCV treatment uptake: high-intensity wraparound care characterized by frequent interactions with supportive services; same-day/walk-in options; low-barrier access to substance use treatment; assistance with navigating the health care system; attention to immediate needs, such as housing; and the opportunity to select an approach that best fits individual circumstances. Active substance use was a major barrier to treatment initiation. To improve uptake, affected individuals recommended that HCV treatment be integrated within substance use treatment programs. Such a model should incorporate patient education within low-barrier, high-intensity wraparound care, tailored to patients' needs and priorities.","Adult;Aftercare;Antiviral Agents;Attention;Blacks;Delivery of Health Care;Drug Users;Female;Future;Hawaii;Health Care Systems;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;History;Housing;Humans;Infections;Interview;Male;Middle Aged;Native Hawaiians;Needs;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Use Disorder;Patient Education as Topic;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Program;Qualitative Research;Reinfection;Solutions;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use;Suggestion;Therapeutics;Whites","Hepatitis C;Infections;Opioid Use Disorder;Reinfection;Substance Abuse, Intravenous;Substance Use",Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33485735,2021,Medication for Adolescents and Young Adults With Opioid Use Disorder.,"Opioid-related morbidity and mortality have risen in many settings globally. It is critical that practitioners who work with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) provide timely, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Such treatment should include medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. Medication treatment is associated with reduced mortality, fewer relapses to opioid use, and enhanced recovery and retention in addiction care, among other positive health outcomes. Unfortunately, the vast majority of AYAs with OUD do not receive medication. The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine recommends that AYAs be offered MOUD as a critical component of an integrated treatment approach. Barriers to receipt of medications are widespread; many are common to high-, middle-, and low-income countries alike, whereas others differ. Such barriers should be minimized to ensure equitable access to youth-friendly, affirming, and confidential addiction treatment that includes MOUD. Robust education on OUD and medication treatment should be provided to all practitioners who work with AYAs. Strategies to reduce stigma surrounding medication-and stigma experienced by individuals with substance use disorders more generally-should be widely implemented. A broad research agenda is proposed with the goal of expanding the evidence base for the use and delivery of MOUD for AYAs.","Adolescent;Adolescent Health;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Education;Goals;Health;Humans;Income;Medicine;Methadone;Morbidity;Mortality;Naltrexone;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Relapse;Research;Societies;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Work;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Relapse;Substance Use Disorders,J Adolesc Health,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33524644,2021,Is the rise in illicit opioids affecting labor supply and disability claiming rates?,"This paper examines how the recent transition of the opioid crisis from prescription opioids to more prevalent misuse of illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, altered labor supply behavior and disability insurance claiming rates. We exploit differential geographic exposure to the reformulation of OxyContin, the largest reduction in access to abusable prescription opioids to date, to study the effects of substitution to illicit markets. We observe meaningful reductions in labor supply measured in terms of employment-to-population ratios, hours worked, and earnings in states more exposed to reformulation relative to those less exposed. We also find evidence of increases in disability applications and beneficiaries.","Analgesics, Opioid;Behavior;Dates;Employment;Fentanyl;Health;Heroin;Humans;Incidence;Insurance, Disability;Occupational Groups;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Oxycodone;Paper;Population;Prescriptions;Relatives;United States;Workforce",Opioid-Related Disorders,J Health Econ,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

This retrospective cross-sectional study used de-identified pharmacy claims representing 90% of all prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies in 50 states and the District of Columbia. We performed a multivariable logistic regression to examine filled naloxone prescriptions among patients receiving buprenorphine treatment and assessed how filled naloxone prescriptions vary by patient, prescriber, and community characteristics. Filled naloxone prescriptions occurred among 4.5% of buprenorphine treatment episodes. Episodes paid through Medicaid (aOR 2.40, 95%CI 2.33-2.47) and Medicare (aOR 1.53, 95%CI 1.46-1.60) had higher odds of filled naloxone prescriptions than commercial insurance episodes. Compared to episodes where the primary prescriber was an adult primary care physician, odds of filling a naloxone prescription were higher among episodes prescribed by addiction specialists (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.37) and physician assistants/nurse practitioners (aOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.53-1.61). Prescribing naloxone to patients receiving buprenorphine represents a tangible clinical action that can be taken to help prevent opioid overdose deaths. However, despite recommendations to co-prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk for opioid overdose, rates of filling naloxone prescriptions remain low among patients dispensed buprenorphine.

33598891,2021,Individual and Community Factors Associated with Naloxone Co-prescribing Among Long-term Opioid Patients: a Retrospective Analysis.,"Naloxone co-prescribing to individuals at increased opioid overdose risk is a key component of opioid overdose prevention efforts. Examine naloxone co-prescribing in the general population and assess how co-prescribing varies by individual and community characteristics. Retrospective cross-sectional study. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression of 2017-2018 de-identified pharmacy claims representing 90% of all prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Individuals with opioid analgesic treatment episodes &gt; 90 days MAIN MEASURES: Outcome was co-prescribed naloxone. Predictor variables included insurance type, primary prescriber specialty, receipt of concomitant benzodiazepines, high-dose opioid episode, county urbanicity, fatal overdose rates, poverty rates, and primary care health professional shortage areas. Naloxone co-prescribing occurred in 2.3% of long-term opioid therapy episodes. Medicaid (aOR 1.87, 95%CI 1.84 to 1.90) and Medicare (aOR 1.48, 95%CI 1.46 to 1.51) episodes had higher odds of naloxone co-prescribing than commercial insurance episodes, while cash pay (aOR 0.77, 95%CI 0.74 to 0.80) and other insurance episodes (aOR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79 to 0.83) had lower odds. Odds of naloxone co-prescribing were higher among high-dose opioid episodes (aOR 3.19, 95%CI 3.15 to 3.23), when concomitant benzodiazepines were prescribed (aOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.10 to 1.14), and in counties with higher fatal overdose rates. Co-prescription of naloxone represents a tangible clinical action that can be taken to help prevent opioid overdose deaths. However, despite recommendations to co-prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk for opioid overdose, we found that co-prescribing rates remain low overall.

33845029,2021,Methadone and buprenorphine discontinuation among postpartum women with opioid use disorder.,"The postpartum year is a vulnerable period for women with opioid use disorder, with increased rates of fatal and nonfatal overdose; however, data on the continuation of medications for opioid use disorder on a population level are limited. This study aimed to examine the effect of discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine in women with opioid use disorder in the year following delivery and determine the extent to which maternal and infant characteristics are associated with time to discontinuation of medications for opioid use disorder. This population-based retrospective cohort study used linked administrative data of 211,096 deliveries in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2014 to examine the adherence to medications for opioid use disorder. Individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder after delivery were included in the study. Here, demographic, psychosocial, prenatal, and delivery characteristics are described. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modeling were used to examine factors associated with medication discontinuation. A total of 2314 women who received medications for opioid use disorder at delivery were included in our study. Overall, 1484 women (64.1%) continued receiving medications for opioid use disorder for a full 12 months following delivery. The rate of continued medication use varied from 34% if women started on medications for opioid use disorder the month before delivery to 80% if the medications were used throughout pregnancy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves differed by maternal race and ethnicity (the 12-month continuation probability was .65 for White non-Hispanic women and .51 for non-White women; P&lt;.001) and duration of use of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder (12-month continuation probability was .78 for women with full prenatal engagement and .60 and .44 for those receiving medications for opioid use disorder ≥5 months [but not throughout pregnancy] and ≤4 months prenatally, respectively; P&lt;.001). In all multivariable models, duration of receipt of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder (≤4 months vs throughout pregnancy: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.72-3.91) and incarceration (incarceration during pregnancy or after delivery vs none: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.12) were most strongly associated with the discontinuation of medications for opioid use disorder. Almost two-thirds of women with opioid use disorder continued using medications for opioid use disorder for a full year after delivery; however, the rates of medication continuation varied significantly by race and ethnicity, degree of use of prenatal medications for opioid use disorder, and incarceration status. Prioritizing medication continuation across the perinatal continuum, enhancing sex-specific and family-friendly recovery supports, and expanding access to medications for opioid use disorder despite being incarcerated can help improve postpartum medication adherence.","Access To Medicines;Adult;African Americans;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Correctional Facilities;Demography;Drug Use Disorders;Ethnic Groups;Family;Female;Hispanics;Humans;Infant;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves;Latinos;Massachusetts;Medication Adherence;Methadone;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Overall;Population;Postpartum Period;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Probability;Proportional Hazards Models;Racial Stocks;Sex;Substance Use Disorders;Survival Analysis;Time;Whites;Women;Young Adult",Drug Use Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pregnancy Complications;Substance Use Disorders,Am J Obstet Gynecol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
33873027,2021,"Growing racial/ethnic disparities in buprenorphine distribution in the United States, 2007-2017.","To assess whether per capita buprenorphine distribution varies by regional racial/ethnic composition, Medicaid expansion status, and time period. Our unit of analysis -- three-digit ZIP codes (""ZIP3s"") -- was classified into quintiles based on percentage of White residents. A weighted linear regression model of buprenorphine distribution -- including White resident quintile, waivered prescriber rate, overdose rate, sociodemographic factors, and year fixed effects -- was estimated using national buprenorphine distribution data from 2007 to 2017. We report predictive margins of the buprenorphine distribution rate by quintile, as well as average marginal effects of waivered prescriber rate on buprenorphine distribution rate for each quintile. Analyses were stratified by Medicaid expansion status and time period (2007-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2017). Buprenorphine distribution increased nationally during 2007-2017, yet growth was disproportionately greater for ZIP3s with higher percentages of White residents. Medicaid expansion states exhibited significant differences in buprenorphine distribution across ZIP3 quintiles during 2007-2010, the magnitude of which increased across time periods. Non-expansion states exhibited significant quintile differences during 2011-2014 and 2015-2017. The average marginal effect of increasing the waivered prescriber rate on the distribution rate was consistently smaller in ZIP3s with lower percentages of White residents, particularly in expansion states. We find ecological evidence consistent with racial/ethnic disparities in buprenorphine distribution. Our finding that increasing the waivered prescriber rate had differential effects by ZIP3 racial/ethnic composition suggest that broad initiatives to increase the number of waivered prescribers are likely insufficient to achieve equitable buprenorphine access.

33883971,2021,Methodological Challenges and Proposed Solutions for Evaluating Opioid Policy Effectiveness.,"Opioid-related mortality increased by nearly 400% between 2000 and 2018. In response, federal, state, and local governments have enacted a heterogeneous collection of opioid-related policies in an effort to reverse the opioid crisis, producing a policy landscape that is both complex and dynamic. Correspondingly, there has been a rise in opioid-policy related evaluation studies, as policymakers and other stakeholders seek to understand which policies are most effective. In this paper, we provide an overview of methodological challenges facing opioid policy researchers when evaluating the effects of opioid policies using observational data, as well as some potential solutions to those challenges. In particular, we discuss the following key challenges: (1) Obtaining high-quality opioid policy data; (2) Appropriately operationalizing and specifying opioid policies; (3) Obtaining high-quality opioid outcome data; (4) Addressing confounding due to systematic differences between policy and non-policy states; (5) Identifying heterogeneous policy effects across states, population subgroups, and time; (6) Disentangling effects of concurrent policies; and (7) Overcoming limited statistical power to detect policy effects afforded by commonly-used methods. We discuss each of these challenges and propose some ways forward to address them. Increasing the methodological rigor of opioid evaluation studies is imperative to identifying and implementing opioid policies that are most effective at reducing opioid-related harms.","Address;Classification;Collection;Data Quality;Evaluation Study;Local Government;Methods;Mortality;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Paper;Policy;Population;Power, Psychological;Research Personnel;Selection Bias;Solutions;Therapeutics;Time",,Health Serv Outcomes Res Methodol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

United States PARTICIPANTS: Commercially insured individuals initiating one of four FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in 2018: extended-release buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, mucosal buprenorphine (mono- or co-formulated with naloxone), or methadone. Our primary outcome was medication discontinuation, defined as a gap of more than 14 days between the end of one prescription or administration and the subsequent dose. We identified 14,358 individuals initiating MOUD in 2018, including 204 (1%) extended-release buprenorphine, 1,173 (8%) extended-release naltrexone, 12,171 (85%) mucosal buprenorphine, and 810 (6%) methadone initiations. Three months after initiation, 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40%-60%) of extended-release buprenorphine, 64% (95% CI 61%-69%) of extended-release naltrexone, 34% (95% CI 33%-35%) of mucosal buprenorphine, and 58% (95% CI 54%-62%) of methadone initiators had discontinued treatment. Across all treatment groups, medication discontinuation was high, and in this sample of early adopters with limited follow-up time, we found no evidence that extended-release buprenorphine offered a retention advantage compared to other MOUD in real-world settings. Retention continues to represent a major obstacle to treatment effectiveness, and interventions are needed to address this challenge even as new MOUD formulations become available.","Address;Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Clinical Effectiveness;Confidence Intervals;Delayed-Action Preparations;Epidemics;Humans;Methadone;Naloxone;Naltrexone;News;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Prescriptions;Sustained-Release Preparations;Therapeutics;Time;United States",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34091394,2021,Good Samaritan laws and overdose mortality in the United States in the fentanyl era.,"As of July 2018, 45 United States (US) states and the District of Columbia have enacted an overdose Good Samaritan law (GSL). These laws, which provide limited criminal immunity to individuals who request assistance during an overdose, may be of importance in the current wave of the overdose epidemic, which is driven primarily by illicit opioids including heroin and fentanyl. There are substantial differences in the structures of states' GSL laws which may impact their effectiveness. This study compared GSLs which have legal provisions protecting from arrest and laws which have more limited protections. Using national county-level overdose mortality data from 3109 US counties, we examined the association of enactment of GSLs with protection from arrest and GSLs with more limited protections with subsequent overdose mortality between 2013 and 2018. Since GSLs are often enacted in conjunction with Naloxone Access Laws (NAL), we examined the effect of GSLs separately and in conjunction with NAL. We conducted these analyses using hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal Poisson models. GSLs with protections against arrest enactment in conjunction with a NAL were associated with 7% lower rates of all overdose deaths (rate ratio (RR): 0.93% Credible Interval (CI): 0.89-0.97), 10% lower rates in opioid overdose deaths (RR: 0.90; CI: 0.85-0.95) and 11% lower rates of heroin/synthetic overdose mortality (RR: 0.89; CI: 0.82-0.96) two years after enactment, compared to rates in states without these laws. Significant reductions in overdose mortality were not seen for GSLs with protections for charge or prosecution. GSLs with more expansive legal protections combined with a NAL, were associated with lower rates of overdose deaths, although these risk reductions take time to manifest. Policy makers should consider enacting and implementing more expansive GSLs with arrest protections to increase the likelihood people will contact emergency services in the event of an overdose.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Bayes Theorem;Charges;Criminals;Death;Death Rate;District of Columbia;Drug Overdose;Emergencies;Epidemics;Fentanyl;Heroin;Humans;Immunity;Law;Mortality;Naloxone;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Persons;Policy Makers;Risk Reduction;Time;United States",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34100229,2022,"""My Life Isn't Defined by Substance Use"": Recovery Perspectives Among Young Adults with Substance Use Disorder.","While substance use disorder remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for young adults, low rates of treatment engagement and retention persist. One explanation is that substance use disorder treatment approaches do not match young adults' expectations for recovery. While the concept of recovery has been explored among adult populations, less is known about how young adults think about recovery. To describe perspectives of recovery among young adults with substance use disorder. Qualitative, in-depth interviews exploring young adults' definitions of recovery. Twenty English-speaking young adults (7 women; 21-29 years old) diagnosed with substance use disorder recruited from an urban safety net hospital in Massachusetts. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. An iterative categorization analytic approach was used to identify and interpret themes. Four themes related to recovery were identified. First, young adults described recovery as a way to grow up and live a normal life not defined by the substance use. A second theme was recovery had to include multiple components, such as mental health treatment, to be successful. Third, young adults described recovery as a self-motivated process, and it was important that young adults had agency in recovery decision-making. Fourth, recovery was described as a lifelong pursuit that required vigilance and commitment. In this qualitative study of young adults with substance use disorder, participants identified themes that have implications for treatment models. Participants recognized recovery as a complex and individually motivated process that includes multiple components such as mental health treatment and re-engagement in regular daily activities. Models of care for young adults should consider incorporating these treatment elements to improve engagement and retention.",Adult;Decision Making;Elements;Expectations;Female;Humans;Interview;Life;Massachusetts;Mental Health;Morbidity;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Population;Qualitative Research;Safety-net Hospitals;Safety-net Providers;Self;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Women;Young Adult,Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34180978,2021,"Temporal Trends in Opioid Prescribing Practices in Children, Adolescents, and Younger Adults in the US From 2006 to 2018.","Prescription opioids are involved in more than half of opioid overdoses among younger persons. Understanding opioid prescribing practices is essential for developing appropriate interventions for this population. To examine temporal trends in opioid prescribing practices in children, adolescents, and younger adults in the US from 2006 to 2018. A population-based, cross-sectional analysis of opioid prescription data was conducted from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2018. Longitudinal data on retail pharmacy-dispensed opioids for patients younger than 25 years were used in the analysis. Data analysis was performed from December 26, 2019, to July 8, 2020. Opioid dispensing rate, mean amount of opioid dispensed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day (individuals aged 15-24 years) or MME per kilogram per day (age &lt;15 years), duration of prescription (mean, short [≤3 days], and long [≥30 days] duration), high-dosage prescriptions, and extended-release or long-acting (ER/LA) formulation prescriptions. Outcomes were calculated for age groups: 0 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19, and 20 to 24 years. Joinpoint regression was used to examine opioid prescribing trends. From 2006 to 2018, the opioid dispensing rate for patients younger than 25 years decreased from 14.28 to 6.45, with an annual decrease of 15.15% (95% CI, -17.26% to -12.99%) from 2013 to 2018. The mean amount of opioids dispensed and rates of short-duration and high-dosage prescriptions decreased for all age groups older than 5 years, with the largest decreases in individuals aged 15 to 24 years. Mean duration per prescription increased initially for all ages, but then decreased for individuals aged 10 years or older. The duration remained longer than 5 days across all ages. The rate of long-duration prescriptions increased for all age groups younger than 15 years and initially increased, but then decreased after 2014 for individuals aged 15 to 24 years. For children aged 0 to 5 years dispensed an opioid, annual increases from 2011 to 2014 were noted for the mean amount of opioids dispensed (annual percent change [APC], 10.58%; 95% CI, 1.77% to 20.16%) and rates of long-duration (APC, 30.42%; 95% CI, 14.13% to 49.03%), high-dosage (APC, 31.27%; 95% CI, 16.81% to 47.53%), and ER/LA formulation (APC, 27.86%; 95% CI, 12.04% to 45.91%) prescriptions, although the mean amount dispensed and rate of high-dosage prescriptions decreased from 2014 to 2018. These findings suggest that opioid dispensing rates decreased for patients younger than 25 years, with decreasing rates of high-dosage and long-duration prescriptions for adolescents and younger adults. However, opioids remain readily dispensed, and possible high-risk prescribing practices appear to be common, especially in younger children.","Adolescent;Adult;Age Groups;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Child;Comprehension;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data Analysis;Humans;Morphine;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Patients;Persons;Pharmacy;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Risk;United States;Young Adult",Opiate Overdose,JAMA Pediatr,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34216209,2021,Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Association Between Pain Management Clinic Laws and Opioid Prescribing and Overdose Deaths.,"Pain management clinic (PMC) laws were enacted by 12 states to promote appropriate opioid prescribing, but their impact is inadequately understood. We analyzed county-level opioid overdose deaths (National Vital Statistics System) and patients filling long-duration (≥30 day) or high-dose (≥90 morphine milligram equivalents per day) opioid prescriptions (IQVIA, Inc.) in the United States in 2010-2018. We fitted Besag-York-Mollié spatiotemporal models to estimate annual relative rates (RRs) of overdose and prevalence ratios (PRs) of high-risk prescribing associated with any PMC law and 3 provisions: payment restrictions, site inspections, and criminal penalties. Laws with criminal penalties were significantly associated with reduced PRs of long-duration and high-dose opioid prescriptions (adjusted PR = 0.82, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.82, 0.82, and adjusted PR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.74 respectively) and reduced RRs of total and natural/semisynthetic opioid overdoses (adjusted RR = 0.86, 95% CrI: 0.80, 0.92, and adjusted RR = 0.84, and 95% CrI: 0.77, 0.92, respectively). Conversely, PMC laws were associated with increased relative rates of synthetic opioid and heroin overdose deaths, especially criminal penalties (adjusted RR = 1.83, 95% CrI: 1.59, 2.11, and adjusted RR = 2.59, 95% CrI: 2.22, 3.02, respectively). Findings suggest that laws with criminal penalties were associated with intended reductions in high-risk opioid prescribing and some opioid overdoses but raise concerns regarding unintended consequences on heroin/synthetic overdoses.","Adolescent;Adult;Analgesics;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Child;Criminals;Death;Drug Overdose;Female;Heroin;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Law;Male;Middle Aged;Morphine;Opiate Overdose;Opioids;Pain Clinics;Pain Management;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Prevalence;Relatives;Risk;Socioeconomic Factors;Spatio-Temporal Analysis;United States;Vital Statistics;Young Adult",Death;Drug Overdose;Opiate Overdose;Pain,Am J Epidemiol,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34283709,2022,Polysubstance use in a Brazilian national sample: Correlates of co-use of alcohol and prescription drugs.,"Background: Responses to problem substance use have largely focused on illicit drugs, but reports on rising prescription drug misuse worldwide raise questions about their combined use with alcohol and potential consequences. The current study assessed prevalence of alcohol in conjunction with nonmedical opioid and benzodiazepine use across a nationally representative sample of adults in Brazil. Methods: Cross-sectional data on prevalence were estimated from the 2015 Brazilian Household Survey on Substance Use. We estimated past month nonmedical use of benzodiazepines and alcohol and past month nonmedical use of opioids and alcohol among adults who reported any past-year alcohol use. Zero-inflated Poisson models assessed independent correlates of alcohol and nonmedical opioid use, and alcohol and nonmedical benzodiazepine use. Results: Among adults who reported past year alcohol use, 0.4% (N = 257,051) reported past month alcohol and non-medical benzodiazepine use, and 0.5% (N = 337,333) reported past month alcohol and non-medical opioid use. Factors independently associated with co-use of alcohol and benzodiazepines included having depression (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR):4.61 (95%CI 1.76-12.08)), anxiety (aPR:4.21 (95%CI 1.59-11.16)) and tobacco use (aPR: 5.48 (95%CI 2.26-13.27)). Factors associated with past-month alcohol and opioid use included having experienced physical or a threat of violence (aPR: 4.59 (95%CI 1.89-11.14)), and tobacco use (aPR:2.81(95%CI:1.29-6.12)). Conclusions: Co-use of prescription drugs with alcohol remains relatively rare among Brazilians, but findings point to a unique profile of persons at risk. Results of this study are important in light of changing dynamics and international markets of prescription drugs and the need for more research on use of these substances on a global scale.","Adult;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Anxiety;Benzodiazepine;Brazil;Cross-Sectional Studies;Depression;Ethanol;Households;Humans;Illicit Drugs;Latin America;Light;Methods;Needs;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Prescription Drug Misuse;Prescription Drugs;Prevalence;Report;Research;Risk;Scales;Substance Use;Surveys;Tobacco Use;United States;Violence",Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Subst Abus,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34310445,2021,Prescription Opioid Laws and Opioid Dispensing in US Counties: Identifying Salient Law Provisions With Machine Learning.,"Hundreds of laws aimed at reducing inappropriate prescription opioid dispensing have been implemented in the United States, yet heterogeneity in provisions and their simultaneous implementation have complicated evaluation of impacts. We apply a hypothesis-generating, multistage, machine-learning approach to identify salient law provisions and combinations associated with dispensing rates to test in future research. Using 162 prescription opioid law provisions capturing prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) access, reporting and administration features, pain management clinic provisions, and prescription opioid limits, we used regularization approaches and random forest models to identify laws most predictive of county-level and high-dose dispensing. We stratified analyses by overdose epidemic phases-the prescription opioid phase (2006-2009), heroin phase (2010-2012), and fentanyl phase (2013-2016)-to further explore pattern shifts over time. PDMP patient data access provisions most consistently predicted high-dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties. Pain management clinic-related provisions did not generally predict dispensing measures in the prescription opioid phase but became more discriminant of high dispensing and high-dose dispensing counties over time, especially in the fentanyl period. Predictive performance across models was poor, suggesting prescription opioid laws alone do not strongly predict dispensing. Our systematic analysis of 162 law provisions identified patient data access and several pain management clinic provisions as predictive of county prescription opioid dispensing patterns. Future research employing other types of study designs is needed to test these provisions' causal relationships with inappropriate dispensing and to examine potential interactions between PDMP access and pain management clinic provisions.

34482048,2021,Development and validation of a prediction model for opioid use disorder among youth.,"Youth are vulnerable to opioid use initiation and its complications. With growing rates of opioid overdose, strategies to identify youth at risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) to efficiently focus prevention interventions are needed. This study developed and validated a prediction model of OUD in youth aged 14-18 years. The model was developed in a Colorado healthcare system (derivation site) using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Model predictors and outcomes were identified using electronic health record data. The model was externally validated in a separate Denver safety net health system (validation site). Youth were followed for up to 3.5 years. We evaluated internal and external validity using discrimination and calibration. The derivation cohort included 76,603 youth, of whom 108 developed an OUD diagnosis. The model contained 3 predictors (smoking status, mental health diagnosis, and non-opioid substance use or disorder) and demonstrated good calibration (p = 0.90) and discrimination (bootstrap-corrected C-statistic = 0.76: 95 % CI = 0.70, 0.82). Sensitivity and specificity were 57 % and 84 % respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.49 %. The validation cohort included 45,790 youth of whom, 74 developed an OUD diagnoses. The model demonstrated poorer calibration (p &lt; 0.001) but good discrimination (C-statistic = 0.89; 95 % CI = 0.84, 0.95), sensitivity of 87.8 % specificity of 68.6 %, and PPV of 0.45 %. In two Colorado healthcare systems, the prediction model identified 57-88 % of subsequent OUD diagnoses in youth. However, PPV &lt; 1% suggests universal prevention strategies for opioid use in youth may be the best health system approach.",Adolescent;Aged;Calibration;Cohort Studies;Colorado;Diagnosis;Electronic Health Records;Health;Health Care Systems;Humans;Mental Health;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Positive Predictive Value;Predictive Value of Tests;Regression Analysis;Risk;Safety;Sensitivity;Sensitivity and Specificity;Smoking;Specificity;Statistics;Substance Use;Systems Analysis;Youth,Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34568515,2021,THE EVOLVING CONSEQUENCES OF OXYCONTIN REFORMULATION ON DRUG OVERDOSES.,"Recent evidence suggests that the short-term transition of the opioid crisis from prescription opioids to heroin can be attributed to the reformulation of OxyContin, which substantially reduced access to abusable prescription opioids. In this paper, we find that over a longer time horizon, reformulation stimulated illicit drug markets to grow and evolve. We compare overdose trajectories in areas more exposed to reformulation, defined as states with higher rates of nonmedical OxyContin use before reformulation, to less exposed areas. More exposed areas experienced disproportionate increases in fatal overdoses involving synthetic opioids (fentanyl) and nonopioid substances like cocaine, suggesting that these new epidemics are related to the same factors driving the rise in heroin deaths. Instead of just short-term substitution from prescription opioid to heroin overdoses, the transition to illicit markets spurred by reformulation led to growth in the overall overdose rate to unprecedented levels.",Cocaine;Death;Epidemics;Fentanyl;Growth;Heroin;Illicit Drugs;News;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Overall;Oxycontin;Paper;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prescriptions;Time,Death,Am J Health Econ,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34598101,2021,Claims-based measures of prescription opioid utilization: A practical guide for researchers.,"Given the increased attention to the opioid epidemic and the role of inappropriate prescribing, there has been a marked increase in the number of studies using claims data to study opioid use and policies designed to curb misuse. Our objective is to review the medical literature for recent studies that use claims data to construct opioid use measures and to develop a guide for researchers using these measures. We searched for articles relating to opioid use measured in health insurance claims data using a defined set of search terms for the years 2014-2020. Original research articles based in the United States that used claims-based measures of opioid utilization were included and information on the study population and measures of any opioid use, quantity of opioid use, new opioid use, chronic opioid use, multiple providers, and overlapping prescriptions was abstracted. A total of 164 articles met inclusion criteria. Any opioid use was the most commonly included measure, defined by 85 studies. This was followed by quantity of opioids (68 studies), chronic opioid use (53 studies), overlapping prescriptions (28 studies), and multiple providers (8 studies). Each measure contained multiple, distinct definitions with considerable variation in how each was operationalized. Claims-based opioid utilization measures are commonly used in research, but definitions vary significantly from study to study. Researchers should carefully consider which opioid utilization measures and definitions are most appropriate for their study and recognize how different definitions may influence study results.","Analgesics, Opioid;Attention;Humans;Inappropriate Prescribing;Insurance, Health;Literature;Measures;News;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Policy;Population;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Research;Research Personnel;Review;Role;United States",Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34600259,2021,Buprenorphine prescriber monthly patient caseloads: An examination of 6-year trajectories.,"Many active buprenorphine prescribers treat few patients monthly, but little information is available regarding how prescribers' buprenorphine caseload fluctuates over time or how long it takes new prescribers to reach higher patient caseloads. We examine buprenorphine-prescribing clinicians' patient caseloads over time and explore prescriber characteristics associated with different caseload trajectories. Using 2006-2018 national buprenorphine pharmacy claims, we calculate monthly patient caseloads for buprenorphine prescribers for 6 years following a clinician's first filled buprenorphine prescription. We use K-means clustering to identify clusters of clinician caseload trajectories and bivariate analyses to examine prescriber and county characteristics associated with different trajectory classes. We identified 42,067 buprenorphine prescribers with 3 trajectory classes. High-volume (1.4%;n = 571) whose mean monthly patient caseload increased to approximately 40 patients through the initial 20 months and stabilized at 40 or more patients; moderate-volume (9.2%;n = 3891) whose mean patient caseload increased during the initial 20 months, stabilizing at 15-20 patients; and low-volume (89.4%;n = 37,605), who typically had fewer than 5 patients monthly. Most low-volume prescribers (n = 31,470; 83.7% of all prescribers) initially treated 1-2 patients for several months, followed by no subsequent prescribing. Almost three-quarters of buprenorphine prescribers treated no more than a few patients for several months before ceasing buprenorphine prescribing; only 10% of prescribers averaged more than 10 patients per month over the next 6 years. Efforts are needed to identify factors contributing to prescribers being willing to continue prescribing buprenorphine over time and to prescribe to more patients in order to increase access to buprenorphine treatment.","Buprenorphine;Cluster Analysis;Humans;News;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pharmacies;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Prescriptions;Therapeutics;Time",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Depend,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34608565,2022,"Rapid Discontinuation of Chronic, High-Dose Opioid Treatment for Pain: Prevalence and Associated Factors.","To examine the prevalence of rapid discontinuation of chronic, high-dose opioid analgesic treatment, and identify associated patient, clinician, and community factors. Using 2017-2018 retail pharmacy claims data from IQVIA, we identified chronic, high-dose opioid analgesic treatment episodes discontinued during these years and determined the percent of episodes meeting criteria for rapid discontinuation. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the probability of rapid discontinuation, conditional on having a discontinued chronic, high-dose opioid treatment episode, as a function of patient, provider, and county characteristics. We identified 810,120 new, chronic, high-dose opioid treatment episodes discontinued in 2017 or 2018, of which 72.0% (n=583,415) were rapidly discontinued. Rapid discontinuation was significantly more likely among Medicare (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.15) and Medicaid enrollees (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05) compared to the commercially insured; in counties with higher fatal overdose rates (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04) compared to counties with the lowest fatal overdose rates; and in counties with a higher percentage of non-white residents (aOR 1.21 for counties in the highest quartile relative to the lowest, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.24). Likelihood of rapid discontinuation also varied by prescriber specialty. Most chronic, high-dose opioid treatment episodes that ended in 2017 or 2018 were discontinued more rapidly than recommended by clinical guidelines, raising concerns about adverse patient outcomes. Our findings highlight the need to understand what drives discontinuation and to inform safer opioid tapering and discontinuation practices.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Clinical Practice Guideline;Community;Drive;Drug Overdose;Humans;Logistic Regression;Medicaid;Medicare;Needs;News;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacy;Policy;Prevalence;Probability;Relatives;Safety;Therapeutics;United States;Whites",Chronic Pain;Drug Overdose;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34714505,2022,Differential Impact of a Universal Prevention Program on Academic Self-Efficacy: the Moderating Role of Baseline Self-Control.,"Self-control (SC) plays a critical role in development across the life course; poor SC is a common antecedent of outcomes with high public health and societal burden including lower educational and occupational attainment, problem substance use, depression, obesity, and antisocial behavior. Further, SC is associated with academic self-efficacy and academic success; therefore, optimizing SC in early childhood could have long-term health and educational implications. However, it remains unknown whether the impact of early childhood prevention programs varies by baseline levels of SC, and whether better SC in early childhood leads to better self-efficacy in adolescence. This study leverages a sample of predominately low-/middle-income Black participants (n = 678) who were part of a randomized universal preventive trial in first grade (1993-1995). Teacher-reported SC was measured at baseline. Utilizing a three-step latent transition analysis, transitions between SC classes and academic self-efficacy trajectories were explored. Intervention status was explored as a predictor of the transition. Results suggest that teacher-rated SC in early childhood predicts academic self-efficacy up to 11 years later. Moderation analyses suggest that there are individual differences in prevention program effectiveness by baseline behavioral regulation skills. Implications for school-based universal prevention programming having an impact on low risk children and methods for exploring moderation within a prevention context are discussed.","Academic Success;Adolescence;Adolescent;Antisocial Behavior;Blacks;Child;Child, Preschool;Depression;Educational Status;Health;Humans;Income;Individuality;Lead;Life;Methods;Obesity;Play;Poverty;Program;Program Effectiveness;Program Evaluation;Public Health;Regulation;Risk;Role;School Health Services;Schools;Self Efficacy;Self-Control;Substance Use",Antisocial Behavior;Obesity;Substance Use,Prev Sci,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34873783,2022,The estimated impact of state-level support for expanded delivery of substance use disorder treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To prevent COVID-19 transmission, some United States (US) federal regulations on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment were suspended in March 2020. This study aimed to quantify the extent of state-level policy uptake and the potential number of people with SUD affected by these policy changes across the US, as well as to assess if policy uptake correlated with rates of people with SUD already in treatment or needing treatment. Cross-sectional analysis of policies implemented as of April 13, 2020. A total of 50 US states and the District of Columbia MEASUREMENTS: State-level implementation of: oral schedule II controlled substances emergency prescription, extended take-home doses for medication for opioid use disorders (MOUD), home-delivery of take-home medications, telemedicine for schedule II-IV prescriptions, telemedicine for buprenorphine prescribing initiation, and waiver of out-of-state Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration. Rates per 100 000 population of: adults in treatment for SUD, MOUD treatment at facilities with opioid treatment programs, SUD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria, and needing, but not receiving treatment. Half of the states (n = 24) enacted no policies, leaving ~460 955 people in treatment and 114 370 people on MOUD pre-pandemic uncovered by any policy expansion. Only telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation was marginally associated with pre-pandemic rate of SUD treatment (OR = 1.003, 95% CI = [1.001, 1.006]) and rate of MOUD therapy (OR = 1.006, 95% CI = [1.002, 1.011]) in univariable analysis, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for state-level demographics. No policies were associated with state-wide SUD prevalence or rate of unmet treatment need (P &gt; 0.05). Twenty-four United States states did not implement at least one federal policy for substance use disorder treatment expansion as of April 2020, leaving approximately half a million people in treatment pre-pandemic potentially without access to treatment or risking exposure to COVID-19 to continue in-person therapies.",Access to Therapy;Administration;Adult;Association;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Controlled Substances;Cross-Sectional Studies;DSM-IV;Demography;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;District of Columbia;Emergencies;Humans;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pandemics;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Population;Prescriptions;Prevalence;Program;Regulation;Schedules;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Telemedicine;Therapeutics;United States,COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,Addiction,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
34981359,2022,Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Initiation and Continuation: a Qualitative Study of Patients Who Received Addiction Consultation and Hospital-Based Providers.,"Hospitalizations related to opioid use disorder (OUD) are rising. Addiction consultation services (ACS) increasingly provide OUD treatment to hospitalized patients, but barriers to initiating and continuing medications for OUD remain. We examined facilitators and barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers in the context of an ACS. In this qualitative study, we sought input using key informant interviews and focus groups from patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization and from hospitalists, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses who work in the hospital setting. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed transcripts using a directed content analysis. We conducted 20 key informant interviews with patients, nine of whom were interviewed following hospital discharge and 12 of whom were interviewed during a rehospitalization. We completed six focus groups and eight key informant interviews with hospitalists and hospital-based medical staff (n = 62). Emergent themes related to hospital-based OUD treatment included the following: the benefit of an ACS to facilitate OUD treatment engagement; expanded use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid withdrawal; the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and easily accessible, patient-centered treatment motivates change in opioid use; adequate pain control and stabilization of mental health conditions among patients with OUD contributed to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) continuation; and stable housing and social support are prerequisites for OAT uptake and continuation. Modifiable factors which facilitate hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation include availability of in-hospital addiction expertise to offer easily accessible, patient-centered treatment and the use of methadone or buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal. Further research and public policy efforts are urgently needed to address reported barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation which include unstable housing, poorly controlled chronic medical and mental illness, and lack of social support.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Avena;Buprenorphine;Consultation;Focus Groups;Health Personnel;Hospitalists;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Housing;Humans;Interview;Medical Staff;Mental Disorders;Mental Health;Methadone;Nurses;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Patients;Pharmacists;Public Policy;Referral and Consultation;Research;Self Efficacy;Social Support;Social Workers;Therapeutics;Work",Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain,J Gen Intern Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35026792,2022,"Variation in Initiation, Engagement, and Retention on Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Based on Health Insurance Plan Design.","The association between cost-sharing and receipt of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is unknown. We constructed a cohort of 10,513 commercially insured individuals with a new diagnosis of opioid use disorder and information on insurance cost-sharing in a large national deidentified claims database. We examined 4 cost-sharing measures: (1) pharmacy deductible; (2) medical service deductible; (3) pharmacy medication copay; and (4) medical office copay. We measured MOUD (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) initiation (within 14 d of diagnosis), engagement (second receipt within 34 d of first), and 6-month retention (continuous receipt without 14-d gap). We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between cost-sharing and MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention. We calculated total out-of-pocket costs in the 30 days following MOUD initiation for each type of MOUD. Of 10,513 individuals with incident opioid use disorder, 1202 (11%) initiated MOUD, 742 (7%) engaged, and 253 (2%) were retained in MOUD at 6 months. A high ($1000+) medical deductible was associated with a lower odds of initiation compared with no deductible (odds ratio: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.98). We found no significant associations between other cost-sharing measures for initiation, engagement, or retention. Median initial 30-day out-of-pocket costs ranged from $100 for methadone to $710 for extended-release naltrexone. Among insurance plan cost-sharing measures, only medical services deductible showed an association with decreased MOUD initiation. Policy and benefit design should consider ways to reduce cost barriers to initiation and retention in MOUD.","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Buprenorphine;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Cost;Cost Sharing;Cost-Sharing Insurance;Database;Deductibles;Diagnosis;Expenditures, Out-of-Pocket;Female;Health Expenditures;Humans;Insurance;Insurance, Health;Logistic Regression;Male;Measures;Medication Adherence;Methadone;Middle Aged;Naltrexone;News;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pharmacy;Policy;United States;Young Adult",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Med Care,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35226078,2022,Simulated Cost-effectiveness and Long-term Clinical Outcomes of Addiction Care and Antibiotic Therapy Strategies for Patients With Injection Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis.,"Emerging evidence supports the use of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) and, in many cases, partial oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis (IDU-IE); however, long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness remain unknown. To compare the added value of inpatient addiction care services and the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of alternative antibiotic treatment strategies for patients with IDU-IE. This decision analytical modeling study used a validated microsimulation model to compare antibiotic treatment strategies for patients with IDU-IE. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials and observational cohort studies. The model included all patients with injection opioid drug use (N = 5 million) in the US who were eligible to receive OPAT either in the home or at a postacute care facility. Costs were annually discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care sector perspective over a lifetime starting in 2020. Probabilistic sensitivity, scenario, and threshold analyses were performed to address uncertainty. The model simulated 4 treatment strategies: (1) 4 to 6 weeks of inpatient intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy along with opioid detoxification (usual care strategy), (2) 4 to 6 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with inpatient addiction care services that offered medication for opioid use disorder (usual care/addiction care strategy), (3) 3 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with addiction care services followed by OPAT (OPAT strategy), and (4) 3 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with addiction care services followed by partial oral antibiotic therapy (partial oral antibiotic strategy). Mean percentage of patients completing treatment for IDU-IE, deaths associated with IDU-IE, life expectancy (measured in life-years [LYs]), mean cost per person, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). All modeled scenarios were initialized with 5 million individuals (mean age, 42 years; range, 18-64 years; 70% male) who had a history of injection opioid drug use. The usual care strategy resulted in 18.63 LYs at a cost of $416 570 per person, with 77.6% of hospitalized patients completing treatment. Life expectancy was extended by each alternative strategy. The partial oral antibiotic strategy yielded the highest treatment completion rate (80.3%) compared with the OPAT strategy (78.8%) and the usual care/addiction care strategy (77.6%). The OPAT strategy was the least expensive at $412 150 per person. Compared with the OPAT strategy, the partial oral antibiotic strategy had an ICER of $163 370 per LY. Increasing IDU-IE treatment uptake and decreasing treatment discontinuation made the partial oral antibiotic strategy more cost-effective compared with the OPAT strategy. When assuming that all patients with IDU-IE were eligible to receive partial oral antibiotic therapy, the strategy was cost-saving and resulted in 0.0247 additional discounted LYs. When treatment discontinuation was decreased from 3.30% to 2.65% per week, the partial oral antibiotic strategy was cost-effective compared with OPAT at the $100 000 per LY threshold. In this decision analytical modeling study, incorporation of OPAT or partial oral antibiotic approaches along with addiction care services for the treatment of patients with IDU-IE was associated with increases in the number of people completing treatment, decreases in mortality, and savings in cost compared with the usual care strategy of providing inpatient IV antibiotic therapy alone.","Address;Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Anti-Infective Agents;Antibiotics;Clinical Trial;Cohort Studies;Cost;Cost Effectiveness;Cost Savings;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Death;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Female;Health Care Sector;History;Humans;Infective Endocarditis;Injections;Inpatients;Life;Life Expectancy;Male;Mortality;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioids;Outpatients;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Savings;Sensitivity;Subacute Care;Therapeutics;Uncertainty","Death;Endocarditis;Endocarditis, Bacterial;Infective Endocarditis;Opioid Use Disorder",JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35305851,2022,Subsequent Buprenorphine Treatment Following Emergency Physician Buprenorphine Prescription Fills: A National Assessment 2019 to 2020.,"Buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder provided in the emergency department with subsequent buprenorphine treatment by community prescribers is associated with improved outcomes, but the frequency with which this occurs is unknown. We examined the rates of subsequent buprenorphine treatment for buprenorphine-naïve individuals filling buprenorphine prescriptions from emergency physicians and initiated buprenorphine treatment and how such rates varied before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using pharmacy claims capturing an estimated 92% of prescriptions filled at US retail pharmacies, we identified buprenorphine prescriptions filled between February 1, 2019, and November 30, 2020, written by emergency physicians. In this observational study, we calculated the rate at which patients subsequently filled buprenorphine prescriptions from other nonemergency clinicians, the frequency with which subsequent filled prescriptions were from different types of prescribers, and the changes in the rates of subsequent prescriptions following the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. We identified 22,846 prescriptions written by emergency physicians and filled by buprenorphine-naïve patients. They were most commonly paid for by Medicaid and were in metropolitan counties; 28.5% of patients subsequently filled buprenorphine prescriptions written by other clinicians. Adult primary care physicians and advanced practice providers (eg, physician assistants and nurse practitioners) were responsible for most of the subsequent prescriptions. The rates of subsequent prescriptions were 3.5% lower after the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. The majority of patients filling buprenorphine prescriptions written by emergency physicians do not subsequently fill prescriptions written by other clinicians, and the rates of subsequent prescriptions were lower after the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. These findings highlight the need for a system of care that improves buprenorphine treatment continuity of care for patients with opioid use disorder from emergency settings to community treatment providers.","Adult;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Community;Continuity of Patient Care;Emergencies;Emergency Service, Hospital;Humans;Medicaid;Needs;Nurse Practitioners;Observational Study;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Pharmacy;Physician Assistants;Physicians;Physicians, Primary Care;Prescriptions;Public Health;Therapeutics;United States",COVID-19;COVID-19 Pandemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Ann Emerg Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35341614,2022,"""You have to take this medication, but then you get punished for taking it:"" lack of agency, choice, and fear of medications to treat opioid use disorder across the perinatal period.","Medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy and in the postpartum period remain underutilized. A need exists to enhance our understanding of modifiable factors, facilitators, and barriers to MOUD utilization and adherence in the perinatal period to improve maternal and child outcomes. The study conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with recently pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) to explore experiences as a pregnant and/or parenting person with OUD, perceptions of enabling factors and barriers to treatment utilization, incentivizing factors for maintaining adherence, and acceptability of ongoing supports to sustain treatment adherence. The study team used constant comparative methods to analyze transcripts and develop the codebook. The team double coded the transcripts, with an overall kappa coefficient of 0.88. The study team interviewed twenty-six women on average 10.1 months after delivery. All women had some prior experience using MOUD. Four unique themes emerged as barriers to medication utilization and adherence in the perinatal period: 1) Lack of agency and autonomy surrounding medication decisions because pregnancy or parenting status affected treatment adherence; 2) Hesitancy to use MOUD to minimize risk of newborn withdrawal; 3) Concern about increased scrutiny and potential loss of custody due to mandated child protective services reporting for opioid-exposure at delivery in Massachusetts; and 4) Perception that treatment environments, particularly methadone clinics, did not provide gender-responsive or equitable care, and standardized, inflexible visit regulations were particularly difficult to comply with in the early postpartum period. Women with OUD experienced a double bind when making perinatal treatment decisions, describing pressure to use MOUD with negative consequences after delivery. Key areas for possible intervention emerged from interviews. These areas include improving uptake of shared decision-making to increase patient autonomy and agency, particularly among those in the earliest stages of recovery during pregnancy; ongoing education around perinatal MOUD safety and efficacy; detangling MOUD and neonatal withdrawal signs from mandated child protective services reporting; and improving gender-responsive and equitable care in substance use disorder treatment programs, including incorporating the utilization of home visiting services for dosing assessments and administration in the early postpartum period.","Administration;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Child;Child Protective Services;Comprehension;Decision Making, Shared;Education;Enabling Factors;Environment;Fear;Female;Gender;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Interview;Massachusetts;Methadone;Methods;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Parenting;Patients;Perception;Persons;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Pressure;Program;Regulation;Risk;Safety;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Treatment Adherence;Women",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention

35437841,2022,Health harms of non-medical prescription opioid use: A systematic review.,"Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) contributes substantially to the global burden of morbidity. However, no systematic assessment of the scientific literature on the associations between NMPOU and health outcomes has yet been undertaken. We undertook a systematic review evaluating health outcomes related to NMPOU based on ICD-10 clinical domains. We searched 13 electronic databases for original research articles until 1 July 2021. We employed an adaptation of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 'Levels of Evidence' scale to assess study quality. Overall, 182 studies were included. The evidence base was largest on the association between NMPOU and mental and behavioural disorders; 71% (129) studies reported on these outcomes. Less evidence exists on the association of NMPOU with infectious disease outcomes (26; 14%), and on external causes of morbidity and mortality, with 13 (7%) studies assessing its association with intentional self-harm and 1 study assessing its association with assault (&lt;1%). A large body of evidence has identified associations between NMPOU and opioid use disorder as well as on fatal and non-fatal overdose. We found equivocal evidence on the association between NMPOU and the acquisition of HIV, hepatitis C and other infectious diseases. We identified weak evidence regarding the potential association between NMPOU and intentional self-harm, suicidal ideation and assault. Findings may inform the prevention of harms associated with NMPOU, although higher-quality research is needed to characterise the association between NMPOU and the full spectrum of physical and mental health disorders.","Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Classification;Communicable Diseases;Database;Electronics;Evidence-Based Medicine;HIV;Health;Hepatitis C;Humans;ICD-10;Literature;Mental Health;Morbidity;Mortality;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Prescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Research;Scales;Self-Injurious Behavior;Suicidal Ideation;Systematic Review",Communicable Diseases;Hepatitis C;Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Drug Alcohol Rev,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35577664,2022,Impact of prenatal substance use policies on commercially insured pregnant females with opioid use disorder.,"States' approaches to addressing prenatal substance use are widely heterogeneous, ranging from supportive policies that enhance access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment to punitive policies that criminalize prenatal substance use. We studied the effect of these prenatal substance use policies (PSUPs) on medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, including buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone, psychosocial services for SUD treatment, opioid prescriptions, and opioid overdoses among commercially insured pregnant females with OUD. We evaluated: (1) punitive PSUPs criminalizing prenatal substance use or defining it as child maltreatment; (2) supportive PSUPs granting pregnant females priority access to SUD treatment; and (3) supportive PSUPs funding targeted SUD treatment programs for pregnant females. We analyzed 2006-2019 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data. The longitudinal sample comprised females aged 15-45 with an OUD diagnosis at least once during the study period. We estimated fixed effects models that compared changes in outcomes between pregnant and nonpregnant females, in states with and without a PSUP, before and after PSUP implementation. Our analytical sample comprised 2,438,875 person-quarters from 164,538 unique females, of which 13% were pregnant at least once during the study period. We found that following the implementation of PSUPs funding targeted SUD treatment programs, the proportion of opioid overdoses decreased 45% and of any OUD medication increased 11%, with buprenorphine driving this increase (13%). The implementation of SUD treatment priority PSUPs was not associated with significant changes in outcomes. Following punitive PSUP implementation, the proportion receiving psychosocial services for SUD (12%) and methadone (30%) services decreased. In specifications that estimated the impact of criminalizing policies only, the strongest type of punitive PSUP, opioid overdoses increased 45%. Our findings suggest that supportive approaches that enhance access to SUD treatment may effectively reduce adverse maternal outcomes associated with prenatal opioid use. In contrast, punitive approaches may have harmful effects. These findings support leading medical organizations' stance on PSUPs, which advocate for supportive policies that are centered on increased access to SUD treatment and safeguard against discrimination and stigmatization. Our findings also oppose punitive policies, as they may intensify marginalization of pregnant females with OUD seeking treatment.","Aged;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine;Child Abuse;Diagnosis;Female;Humans;Maternal Health;Methadone;Naltrexone;Opiate Overdose;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Organizations;Persons;Policy;Pregnancy;Prescriptions;Program;Stigmatization;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics",Opiate Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders,J Subst Abuse Treat,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35725599,2022,Medicaid Hepatitis C Virus Treatment Policies: Impact on Testing and Treatment in the Commercially Insured.,"A total of 23 state Medicaid programs continue to restrict hepatitis C virus (HCV) medication access by liver disease or substance-use criteria, creating obstacles to HCV elimination and significant care disparities. Because public insurers often set precedents for private insurer coverage and clinician practice patterns, this study sought to analyze whether spillover occurs from state Medicaid HCV treatment restrictions to HCV screening and treatment rates in commercially insured individuals. Investigators analyzed 2014‒2017 commercial claims data across 48 U.S. states (721,961,965 person-months) and used an interrupted times series design to compare hepatitis C virus screening and treatment rates before and after state Medicaid HCV treatment policy changes, adjusting for state-level random effects, Medicaid expansion status, and state drug overdose incidence rates, in states that relaxed Medicaid policy over the study period. Analysis occurred during 2019‒2021. Hepatitis C virus screening rates among commercially insured individuals increased after the corresponding state Medicaid program relaxed HCV treatment policy. Among states that changed Medicaid policy, those that reduced fibrosis or both fibrosis and abstinence restrictions experienced increased HCV screening rates by the study end compared with states that changed only abstinence restrictions (rate ratio=1.29; 95% CI=1.15, 1.44; and rate ratio=1.32; 95% CI=1.17, 1.50, respectively). Similar patterns did not occur in HCV treatment rates, which declined after 2015 across groups. These data show that HCV screening rates increased among commercially insured individuals after the removal of Medicaid HCV treatment restrictions in the same state. This suggests that Medicaid treatment policies can spill over to affect health outcomes among commercially insured populations.",Access To Medicines;Affect;Drug Overdose;Fibrosis;Health;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Humans;Incidence Rate;Insurance Carriers;Interrupted Time Series Analysis;Liver Diseases;Medicaid;Period Analysis;Persons;Policy;Population;Program;Research Personnel;Screening;Substance Use;Therapeutics;United States,Drug Overdose;Fibrosis;Hepatitis C;Liver Diseases;Substance Use,Am J Prev Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35749777,2022,An Exploration of Young Adults With Opioid Use Disorder and How Their Perceptions of Family Members' Beliefs Affects Medication Treatment.,"Young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) have low engagement and retention in medication treatment. Families are uniquely situated to play an important role in treatment decisions. This qualitative study explored how young adults with OUD perceive their families' beliefs about OUD and medication treatment, and how those beliefs impacted young adults' beliefs about their own treatment decisions. We conducted a qualitative study of a convenience sample of 20 English-speaking young adults with OUD receiving care from an urban safety net hospital in Massachusetts. We explored young adults' perceptions of how families viewed medication treatment. We conducted semi-structured interviews that were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed interviews using hybrid inductive and deductive categorization to support thematic analysis. We identified 3 themes. First, family history of substance use disorder and treatment negatively impacted how young adults perceive their OUD and medication treatment. Second, young adults shared that many families held negative or stigmatizing views of medication treatment. Finally, acceptance by family was important but young adults acknowledged that keeping treatment decisions from family was sometimes necessary. In this qualitative exploration of young adults with OUD, we found that young adults felt that their families held important beliefs about the kind of treatment family members found most appropriate, and these perceived family beliefs impacted their treatment choices. Future research to improve engagement and retention of youth adults with OUD could target the beliefs of family members.","Adult;Affect;Beliefs;Family;Family Members;Future;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;History;Hospitals, Urban;Humans;Hybrids;Interview;Massachusetts;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Perception;Play;Qualitative Research;Research;Role;Safety-net Hospitals;Safety-net Providers;Social Perception;Substance Use Disorders;Therapeutics;Young Adult;Youth",Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Substance Use Disorders,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35832727,2022,ORIGINS OF THE OPIOID CRISIS AND ITS ENDURING IMPACTS.,"Overdose deaths involving opioids have increased dramatically since the 1990s, leading to the worst drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history, but there is limited empirical evidence about the initial causes. In this article, we examine the role of the 1996 introduction and marketing of OxyContin as a potential leading cause of the opioid crisis. We leverage cross-state variation in exposure to OxyContin's introduction due to a state policy that substantially limited the drug's early entry and marketing in select states. Recently unsealed court documents involving Purdue Pharma show that state-based triplicate prescription programs posed a major obstacle to sales of OxyContin and suggest that less marketing was targeted to states with these programs. We find that OxyContin distribution was more than 50% lower in ""triplicate states"" in the years after the drug's launch. Although triplicate states had higher rates of overdose deaths prior to 1996, this relationship flipped shortly after the launch and triplicate states saw substantially slower growth in overdose deaths, continuing even 20 years after OxyContin's introduction. Our results show that the introduction and marketing of OxyContin explain a substantial share of overdose deaths over the past two decades.",Death;Drug Overdose;Epidemics;Growth;History;Marketing;Opioid Crisis;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Prescriptions;Program;Role;Sales,Death;Drug Overdose,Q J Econ,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35908313,2022,A modified Delphi process to identify experts' perceptions of the most beneficial and harmful laws to reduce opioid-related harm.,"States have enacted multiple types of laws, with a variety of constituent provisions, in response to the opioid epidemic, often simultaneously. This temporal proximity and variation in state-to-state operationalization has resulted in significant challenges for empirical research on their effects. Thus, expert consensus can be helpful to classify laws and their provisions by their degree of helpfulness and impact. We conducted a four-stage modified policy Delphi process to identify the top 10 most helpful and 5 most harmful provisions from eight opioid-related laws. This iterative consultation with six types of opioid experts included a preliminary focus group (n=12), two consecutive surveys (n=56 and n=40, respectively), and a final focus group feedback session (n=5). On a scale of very harmful (0) to very helpful (4), overdose Good Samaritan laws received the highest average helpfulness rating (3.62, 95% CI: 3.48-3.75), followed by naloxone access laws (3.37, 95% CI: 3.22-3.51), and pain management clinic laws (3.08, 95% CI: 2.89-3.26). Drug-induced homicide (DIH) laws were rated the most harmful (0.88, 95% CI: 0.66-1.11). Impact ratings aligned similarly, although Medicaid laws received the second highest overall impact rating (3.71, 95% CI: 3.45, 3.97). The two most helpful provisions were naloxone standing orders (3.94, 95% CI: 3.86-4.02) and Medicaid coverage of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (3.89, 95% CI: 3.82). Mandatory minimum DIH laws were the most harmful provision (0.73, 95% CI 0.53-0.93); followed by requiring prior authorization for Medicaid coverage of MOUD (1.00 95% CI: 0.72-1.27). Overall, experts rated laws and provisions that facilitated harm reduction efforts and access to MOUD as most helpful. Laws and provisions rated as most harmful criminalized substance use and placed restrictions on access to MOUD. These ratings provide a foundation for evaluating the overall overdose policy environment for each state.","Analgesics, Opioid;Consensus;Consultation;Drug Overdose;Empirical Research;Environment;Feedback;Focus Groups;Foundations;Harm Reduction;Homicide;Humans;Law;Legislation;Legislation, Drug;Medicaid;Methods;Naloxone;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Overall;Pain Management;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy;Prior Authorization;Public Health;Scales;Standing Orders;Substance Use;Surveys;United States",Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use,Int J Drug Policy,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
35977167,2021,Association of Individual and Community Factors With Hepatitis C Infections Among Pregnant People and Newborns.,"The opioid crisis has increasingly affected pregnant people and infants. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, a known complication of opioid use, grew in parallel with opioid-related complications; however, the literature informing individual and community risks associated with maternal HCV infection is sparse. To determine (1) individual and county-level factors associated with HCV among pregnant people and their newborn infants, and (2) how county-level factors influence individual risk among the highest risk individuals. This time-series analysis of retrospective, repeated cross-sectional data included pregnant people in all US counties from 2009 to 2019. We constructed mixed-effects logistic regression models to explore the association between HCV infection and individual and county-level covariates. Analyses were conducted between June 2019 and September 2021. Individual-level: race and ethnicity, education, marital status, insurance type; county-level: rurality, employment, density of obstetricians. Hepatitis C virus as indicated on the newborn's birth certificate. Between 2009 and 2019, there were 39 380 122 pregnant people who met inclusion criteria, among whom 138 343 (0.4%) were diagnosed with HCV. People with HCV were more likely to be White (79.9% vs 53.5%), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (2.9% vs 0.9%), be without a 4-year degree (93.2% vs 68.6%), and be unmarried (73.7% vs 38.8%). The rate (per 1000 live births) of HCV among pregnant people increased from 1.8 to 5.1. In adjusted analyses, the following factors were associated with higher rates of HCV: individuals identified as White (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.37; 95% CI, 7.20-7.55) and AI/AN (aOR, 7.94; 95% CI, 7.58-8.31) compared with Black individuals, those without a 4-year degree (aOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 3.11-3.28), those with Medicaid vs private insurance (aOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 3.21-3.33), and those who were unmarried (aOR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.76-2.84); whereas, rural residence, higher rates of employment, and greater density of obstetricians was associated with lower risk of HCV. Among individuals at the highest risk of HCV, higher levels of county employment, accounting for other factors, were associated with less of a rise in HCV infections over time. In this cross-sectional study, maternal and newborn HCV infections increased substantially between 2009 and 2019, disproportionately among White and AI/AN people without a 4-year degree. County-level factors, including higher levels of employment, were associated with lower individual risks of acquiring the virus.","Accounting;Alaskan Natives;American Natives;Analgesics, Opioid;Association;Birth Certificates;Blacks;Community;Cross-Sectional Studies;Education;Employment;Ethnic Groups;Female;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Infections;Insurance;Literature;Live Birth;Logistic Regression;Marital Status;Medicaid;Odds Ratio;Opioid Crisis;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Persons;Pregnancy;Racial Stocks;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Time;United States;Unmarried;Viruses;Whites",Hepatitis C;Infections;Opioid-Related Disorders,JAMA Health Forum,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
36084559,2022,Barriers to accessing treatment for substance use after inpatient managed withdrawal (Detox): A qualitative study.,"Access to and uptake of evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder, specifically opioid use disorder (OUD), are limited despite the high death toll from drug overdose in the United States in recent years. Patient perceived barriers to evidence-based treatment after completion of short-term inpatient medically managed withdrawal programs (detox) have not been well studied. The purpose of the current study is to elicit patients' perspectives on challenges to transition to treatment, including medications for OUD (MOUD), after detox and potential solutions. We conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 24) at a detox center (2018-2019) to explore patients' perspectives on obstacles to treatment. The study managed the data in NVivo and we used content analysis to identify themes. Patients' characteristics included the following: 54 % male; mean age 37 years; self-identified as White 67 %, Black 13 %, Latinx 8 %, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 4 %, and other 8 %; heroin use in the past 3 months 67 %; and ever injecting drugs 71 %. Patients identified the following barriers: 1) lack of continuity of care; 2) limited number of detox and residential treatment program beds; 3) unstable housing; and 4) lack of options when choosing a treatment pathway. Solutions proposed by participants included: 1) increase low-barrier access to community MOUD; 2) add case managers at the detox center to establish continuity of care after discharge; 3) increase assistance with housing; and 4) encourage patient participation in treatment decisions. Patients identified lack of continuity of care, especially care coordination, as a major barrier to substance use treatment.

36128667,2023,A systematic review of virtual reality therapies for substance use disorders: Impact on secondary treatment outcomes.,"Virtual reality (VR) therapy may be an effective tool in treating urges and cravings in substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high co-occurrence of difficulties with mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation with SUD, this review sought to examine the extant literature on the efficacy of VR for SUD in improving these secondary treatment outcomes. A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase. Studies were included if they utilized immersive VR, were conducted with individuals with substance use disorder/dependence/misuse, and included measures of mood, anxiety, depression, emotional dysregulation, or retention in treatment. Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Five studies were conducted on patients using nicotine and utilized a cue-exposure intervention. VR was effective at reducing substance use and cravings in the majority of studies. Results on the efficacy of VR for improving mood, anxiety, and emotional regulation were mixed. Work examining retention in treatment was limited. VR for SUD has the potential to improve mood and anxiety symptoms as well as retention in treatment for patients with SUD, particularly if the therapy targets these psychological symptoms. Future studies examining components of VR for SUD in individuals with drug use disorders, as well as examinations of targeted interventions for associated mood, emotional dysregulation, and retention in treatment, are necessary. This is the first systematic review of the impact of VR on mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation for individuals with substance use.",Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Classification;Craving;Cues;Depressive Symptoms;Drug Use Disorders;Emotional Regulation;Future;Guideline;Humans;Literature;Measures;Mood;Nicotine;Patients;PubMed;Review;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Systematic Review;Therapeutics;Treatment Outcome;Virtual Reality;Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy;Work,Anxiety Disorders;Drug Use Disorders;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,Am J Addict,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
36367729,2022,Patterns in Geographic Distribution of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities in the US and Accepted Forms of Payment From 2010 to 2021.,"The drug overdose crisis is a continuing public health problem and is expected to grow substantially in older adults. Understanding the geographic accessibility to a substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facility that accepts Medicare can inform efforts to address this crisis in older adults. To assess whether geographic accessibility of services was limited for older adults despite the increasing need for SUD and opioid use disorder treatments in this population. This longitudinal cross-sectional study obtained data on all licensed SUD treatment facilities for all US counties and Census tracts listed in the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs from 2010 to 2021. Measures included the national proportion of treatment facilities accepting Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or cash as a form of payment; the proportion of counties with a treatment facility accepting each form of payment; and the proportion of the national population with Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or cash payment residing within a 15-, 30-, or 60-minute driving time from an SUD treatment facility accepting their form of payment in 2021. A total of 11 709 SUD treatment facilities operated across the US per year between 2010 and 2021 (140 507 facility-year observations). Cash was the most commonly accepted form of payment (increasing slightly from 91.0% in 2010 to 91.6% by 2021), followed by private insurance (increasing from 63.5% to 75.3%), Medicaid (increasing from 54.0% to 71.8%), and Medicare (increasing from 32.1% to 41.9%). The proportion of counties with a treatment facility that accepted Medicare as a form of payment also increased over the same study period from 41.2% to 53.8%, whereas the proportion of counties with a facility that accepted Medicaid as a form of payment increased from 53.5% to 67.1%. The proportion of Medicare beneficiaries with a treatment facility that accepted Medicare as a form of payment within a 15-minute driving time increased from 53.3% to 57.0%. The proportion of individuals with a treatment facility within a 15-minute driving time that accepted their respective form of payment was 73.2% for those with Medicaid, 69.8% for those with private insurance, and 71.4% for those with cash payment in 2021. Results of this study suggest that Medicare beneficiaries have less geographic accessibility to SUD treatment facilities given that acceptance of Medicare is low compared with other forms of payment. Policy makers need to consider increasing reimbursement rates and using additional incentives to encourage the acceptance of Medicare.",Address;Adult;Aged;Alcohol Abuse;Censuses;Comprehension;Cross-Sectional Studies;Directory;Drug Overdose;Form;Health Facilities;Humans;Incentives;Insurance;Measures;Medicaid;Medicare;Needs;Observation;Opioid Use Disorder;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Policy Makers;Population;Program;Public Health;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Therapeutics;Time;United States,Alcohol Abuse;Drug Overdose;Opioid Use Disorder;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,JAMA Netw Open,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Prevention
32702182,2021,Roles of dopamine and glutamate co-release in the nucleus accumbens in mediating the actions of drugs of abuse.,"Projections of ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) neurons to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens have been increasingly implicated as integral to the behavioral and physiological changes involved in the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). Recently, many of these nucleus accumbens-projecting DA neurons were found to also release the neurotransmitter glutamate. This glutamate co-release from DA neurons is critical in mediating the effect of drugs of abuse on addiction-related behaviors. Potential mechanisms underlying the role(s) of dopamine/glutamate co-release in contributing to SUDs are unclear. Nevertheless, an important clue may relate to glutamate's ability to potentiate loading of DA into synaptic vesicles within terminals in the nucleus accumbens in response to drug-induced elevations in neuronal activity, enabling a more robust release of DA after stimulation. Here, we summarize how drugs of abuse, particularly cocaine, opioids, and alcohol, alter DA release in the nucleus accumbens medial shell, examine the potential role of DA/glutamate co-release in mediating these effects, and discuss future directions for further investigating these mechanisms.","Ability;Alcohols;Analgesics, Opioid;Animals;Behavior;Biological Transport;Cocaine;Dopamine;Dopaminergic Neurons;Ethanol;Future;Glutamates;Glutamic Acid;Humans;Mediating;Nerve Net;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioids;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Projection;Rodentia;Role;Species Specificity;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles;Ventral Tegmental Area;Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2",Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,FEBS J,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
32925463,2020,Correlates of Homelessness Among Patients in Methadone Maintenance Treatment.,"Although homelessness and opioid use disorder (OUD) are important public health issues, few studies have examined their cooccurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlates of homelessness among patients enrolled in low-barrier-to-treatment-access methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs for OUD. Demographic, diagnosis-related, and treatment-related correlates were assessed by self-report for 164 patients in MMT. Correlates of past-month homelessness were investigated with logistic regression. Twenty-four percent of patients reported homelessness in the past month. Bivariate analyses initially identified 7 statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) correlates of homelessness: gender; Latinx ethnicity; symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization; self-criticism; and duration of MMT. In the final logistic regression model, which included significant independent variables from the bivariate logistic regressions, patients in MMT who were homeless (vs. domiciled) were more likely to be male (odds ratio 2.54; confidence interval, 1.01-6.36) and report higher symptoms of depression (odds ratio 1.07; confidence interval, 1.01-1.15). Low-barrier-to-treatment-access programs can attract people who are homeless with OUD into MMT. These programs also have an important public health role in addressing both depression and OUD among people who are homeless.",Adult;Age Factors;Anxiety;Confidence Intervals;Demography;Depression;Diagnosis;Ethnic Groups;Female;Gender;Homeless Persons;Homelessness;Humans;Logistic Models;Logistic Regression;Maintenance;Male;Mental Disorders;Methadone;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Patients;Persons;Program;Public Health;Report;Role;Self Report;Self-Criticism;Sex Factors;Socioeconomic Factors;Therapeutics,Mental Disorders;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders,Med Care,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
34145187,2022,A Pilot Investigation of Nonpharmacological Pain Management Intervention Groups in Methadone Maintenance Treatment.,"We examined the feasibility (i.e., single-session attendance) of conducting 3 counselor-delivered nonpharmacological pain management intervention (NPMI) groups in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT): (1) Coping with Pain, an intervention based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, (2) Wii-Covery, an exergame intervention to facilitate exercise, and (3) Juggling Group, an intervention to promote social inclusion and reduce stress. We examined pre-post session changes in pain and mood associated with group attendance. Over 1 month at an MMT clinic with 1800 patients, each NPMI group was offered daily Monday-Friday and 1 was offered on Saturdays. A standardized but unvalidated measure was administered before and after sessions to assess acute changes in current pain intensity and mood states. Paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections were performed for each NPMI group (P &lt; 0.0007 [.05/7]). About 452 patients (67% male, 84% White, mean age, 40) attended at least 1 NPMI group. About 57% reported current chronic pain. Attendance at any NPMI group (for the whole sample and the subset with chronic pain) was significantly associated with acute reductions in current pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and stress, and acute increases in current energy and happiness. Attendance at Coping with Pain and Juggling Group was also associated with acute increases in compassion. Coping with Pain, Wii-Covery, and Juggling Group are feasible to conduct in MMT, and acute improvements in current pain intensity and specific mood states associated with a single session attendance point to the importance of examining systematically the efficacy of these and other NPMIs in MMT.",Adult;Anxiety;Chronic Pain;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Compassion;Counselors;Depression;Exercise;Female;Happiness;Humans;Maintenance;Male;Measures;Methadone;Mood;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Pilot Projects;Pilots;Social Inclusion;Therapeutics;Whites,Chronic Pain;Pain,J Addict Med,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
34555260,2021,Comprehensive pain management as a frontline treatment to address the opioid crisis.,"The opioid crisis continues to devastate individuals and communities in the United States and abroad. While there have been several measures to address the over-prescription of opioid analgesics, the number of overdose deaths related to prescription opioids has not changed appreciably in the last 10 years. Comprehensive (or multidisciplinary) pain recovery programs consist of providers from multiple backgrounds that treat pain on an individual level through a combination of approaches including physical therapy, emotional and spiritual support, cognitive behavioral therapy, and non-opioid pharmacotherapies. Because there is a dynamic interplay between a given chronic pain patient and multiple providers, comprehensive pain programs are not as ""standardized"" as other medical treatments because they are meant to meet the individual needs of each patient and their specific pain diagnoses Methods: Review of the literature. There is evidence that comprehensive pain treatment can reduce pain severity and improve functioning; comprehensive pain treatment can be used to treat those with post-surgical pain, thus preventing the onset of non-medical opioid use and opioid use disorder, and in persons with chronic pain who are on long-term opioid therapy, as a method to reduce or eliminate opioid medication use. Comprehensive pain recovery programs were abundant for a period from the 1960s through the 1980s, but for a variety of reasons, they became financially unsustainable as the national reimbursement environment evolved. In the context of the protracted and deadly opioid crisis, revitalizing and expanding comprehensive pain treatment should be considered as a frontline approach to treat chronic pain.","Address;Analgesics, Opioid;Chronic Pain;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Community;Death;Diagnosis;Drug Therapy;Environment;Humans;Literature;Measures;Methods;Needs;Opioid Crisis;Opioid Epidemic;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Pain, Postoperative;Patients;Persons;Physical Therapy;Prescriptions;Program;Psychiatry;Psychology;Review;Therapeutics;United States","Chronic Pain;Death;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Pain, Postoperative",Brain Behav,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
34561027,2022,Does Traumatic Brain Injury Cause Risky Substance Use or Substance Use Disorder?,"There is a high co-occurrence of risky substance use among adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), although it is unknown if the neurologic sequelae of TBI can promote this behavior. We propose that to conclude that TBI can cause risky substance use, it must be determined that TBI precedes risky substance use, that confounders with the potential to increase the likelihood of both TBI and risky substance use must be ruled out, and that there must be a plausible mechanism of action. In this review, we address these factors by providing an overview of key clinical and preclinical studies and list plausible mechanisms by which TBI could increase risky substance use. Human and animal studies have identified an association between TBI and risky substance use, although the strength of this association varies. Factors that may limit detection of this relationship include differential variability due to substance, sex, age of injury, and confounders that may influence the likelihood of both TBI and risky substance use. We propose possible mechanisms by which TBI could increase substance use that include damage-associated neuroplasticity, chronic changes in neuroimmune signaling, and TBI-associated alterations in brain networks.","Address;Adult;Alcohols;Animals;Association;Behavior;Brain;Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Cocaine;Humans;Injuries;Neuronal Plasticity;Opioids;Review;Sex;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders","Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Injuries;Substance Use;Substance Use Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders",Biol Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
34893825,2022,Primary care and medication management characteristics among patients receiving office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine.,"Office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) is an evidence-based treatment model for opioid use disorder (OUD) offered by both addiction and general primary care providers (PCPs). Calls exist for more PCPs to offer OBOT. Few studies have been conducted on the primary care characteristics of OBOT patients. To characterize medical conditions, medications, and treatment outcomes among patients receiving OBOT with buprenorphine for OUD, and to describe differences among patients by age and by time in care. This study is a retrospective review of medical records on or before 4/29/2019 at an outpatient primary care clinic within a nonprofit addiction treatment setting. Inclusion criterion was all clinic patients actively enrolled in the OBOT program. Patients not prescribed buprenorphine or with no OBOT visits were excluded. Of 355 patients, 42.0% had another PCP. Common comorbid conditions included chronic pain and psychiatric diagnosis. Few patients had chronic viral hepatitis or HIV. Patients reported a median of 4 medications. Common medications were cardiovascular, antidepressant, and nonopioid pain agents. Older patients had a higher median number of medications. There was no significant difference in positive opioid urine toxicology (UT) based on age, chronic pain status, or psychoactive medications. Patients retained &gt;1 year were less likely to have positive opioid UT. Clinical needs of many patients receiving OBOT are similar to those of the general population, supporting calls for PCPs to provide OBOT.","Analgesics, Opioid;Antidepressive Agents;Buprenorphine;Chronic Pain;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;HIV;Hepatitis;Humans;Medical Records;Medication Therapy Management;Needs;Opiate Substitution Treatment;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Opioids;Outpatients;Pain;Patients;Polypharmacy;Population;Primary Health Care;Program;Review;Therapeutics;Time;Toxicology;Treatment Outcome;Urine","Chronic Pain;Diagnosis, Psychiatric;Hepatitis;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain",Fam Pract,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
35366844,2022,Characterizing the social support and functioning of a low-threshold medication for opioid use disorder treatment cohort at intake.,"Despite the growing morbidity and mortality rates associated with opioid use disorder, a large gap still exists between treatment need and capacity. Low-threshold clinics utilizing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment can increase treatment access but are understudied, and little is known about how patient demographic characteristics are associated with their social support and functioning in these settings. We used multivariate regression to estimate associations between demographic characteristics and self-reported social support or functioning indicators among patients receiving MOUD in a low-threshold clinic using several validated instruments administered at intake: Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and Life Events Checklist for DSM-5. Patients initiating MOUD treatment between April 1 and December 31, 2017, with complete surveys were included (N=582). Patients were primarily male (62%), aged 34 or older (53%), non-Hispanic White (79%), separated or not married (86%), and unemployed (64%). Over 20% did not live in a house or apartment in the past month. Women were more likely to ""get along"" with people outside their family or in social situations and to identify their partner as their source of support. Women, non-White, and older patients were at higher risk of social functioning-disrupting events (physical/sexual assaults or experiencing chronic pain), while employment and housing were protective against exposure to these trauma-related events. However, employment and housing also decreased the odds of talking with others about substance use. The aforementioned results were obtained from multivariate logistic regression models and were significant to p&lt;0.05. Variation in support and functioning by demographic characteristics suggests that treatment facilities may benefit from adopting strategies that take baseline disparities in support and functioning into account.",Adult;Aged;Association;Behavior;Checklist;Chronic Pain;Cohort Studies;Death Rate;Demography;Employment;Family;Female;Hispanics;Housing;Humans;Indicators;Inventories;Life;Logistic Regression;Male;Morbidity;Needs;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Patients;Persons;Risk;Scales;Self;Separated;Social Functioning;Social Support;Substance Use;Surveys;Surveys and Questionnaires;Therapeutics;Whites;Women;Wounds and Injuries,Chronic Pain;Opioid Use Disorder;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain;Substance Use;Wounds and Injuries,BMC Psychiatry,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
35439798,2022,Association of affective state with the assimilation of daily pain expectancy and pain experience.,"Expectancies for pain and pain relief are central to experimental models of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia and are a promising target for clinical intervention in patients with chronic pain. Affective states may play an important role in modulating the degree to which expectancies influence pain, broadening the opportunities for intervention targets. However, findings to date have been mixed and mostly limited to laboratory designs. Few studies have examined the interplay of naturally occurring affective states, pain expectancies, and pain experiences in the course of daily life with chronic pain. In this study, patients with temporomandibular disorder reported their daily pain expectancies and affective states each morning and their daily pain experience each evening, over a 2-week period. Multilevel modeling analyses revealed the association of morning pain expectancies with subsequent pain experiences was moderated by morning positive affective state ( B = 0.04, SE = 0.02, t = 2.00, P = 0.046) such that the congruent assimilation of a low pain expectancy with a low pain experience was starkest when morning positive affect was higher than usual. Relatedly, higher morning positive affect predicted greater odds of experiencing a match between pain expectancies and pain experience when the expectation was for low, but not high, pain levels (odds ratio = 1.19, confidence interval: 1.01-1.41, P = 0.03). Negative affect, in contrast, did not significantly influence the assimilation of high pain expectancies with high pain experiences. These findings extend previous experimental studies by showing that the association of daily pain expectancies with pain experience varies as a function of affective state.",Affect;Analgesia;Association;Chronic Pain;Confidence Intervals;Dates;Emotions;Expectations;Experimental Model;Humans;Hyperalgesia;Laboratories;Life;Nocebo Effect;Odds Ratio;Pain;Patients;Placebos;Play;Role;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,Chronic Pain;Hyperalgesia;Pain;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,Pain,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Not,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery
32425793,2020,A Balanced Approach for Cannabidiol Use in Chronic Pain.,"Cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa L., has gained traction as a potential treatment for intractable chronic pain in many conditions. Clinical evidence suggests that CBD provides therapeutic benefit in certain forms of epilepsy and imparts analgesia in certain conditions, and improves quality of life. CBD continues to be Schedule I or V on the list of controlled substances of the Drug Enforcement Agency of the United States. However, preparations labeled CBD are available publicly in stores and on the streets. However, use of CBD does not always resolve pain. CBD purchased freely entails the risk of adulteration by potentially hazardous chemicals. As well, CBD use by pregnant women is rising and poses a major health-hazard for future generations. In this mini-review, we present balanced and unbiased pre-clinical and clinical findings for the beneficial effects of CBD treatment on chronic pain and its deleterious effects on prenatal development.",Analgesia;Cannabidiol;Cannabis;Cannabis sativa;Chronic Pain;Controlled Substances;Epilepsy;Form;Future Generations;Hazardous Chemicals;Health;Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pregnant Women;Quality of Life;Review;Risk;Schedules;Therapeutics;Traction;United States,Chronic Pain;Epilepsy;Pain,Front Pharmacol,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment
33271850,2020,Considerations for Cannabis Use to Treat Pain in Sickle Cell Disease.,"Pain in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a major comorbidity and unique with acute pain due to recurrent and episodic vaso-occlusive crises as well as chronic pain, which can span an individual's entire life. Opioids are the mainstay treatment for pain in SCD. Due to recent health crises raised by adverse effects including deaths from opioid use, pain management in SCD is adversely affected. Cannabis and its products are most widely used for pain in multiple conditions and also by patients with SCD on their own. With the availability of ""Medical Cannabis"" and approval to use cannabis as medicine across majority of States in the United States as well as over-the-counter preparations, cannabis products are being used increasingly for SCD. The reliability of many of these products remains questionable, which poses a major health risk to the vulnerable individuals seeking pain relief. Therefore, this review provides up to date insights into available categories of cannabis-based treatment strategies, their mechanism of action and pre-clinical and clinical outcomes in SCD. It provides evidence for the benefits and risks of cannabis use in SCD and cautions about the unreliable and unvalidated products that may be adulterated with life-threatening non-cannabis compounds.","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cannabinoids;Cannabis;Chronic Pain;Comorbidity;Dates;Death;Health;Life;Medical Marijuana;Medicine;Opioids;Pain;Pain Management;Patients;Review;Risk;Risks and Benefits;Therapeutics;United States","Acute Pain;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Chronic Pain;Death;Pain",J Clin Med,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment

We present a novel method for recording electrophysiological activity from the human spinal cord using implanted epidural electrodes during naturalistic movements including overground walking. Spinal electrograms (SEGs) were recorded from epidural electrodes implanted as part of a test trial for patients with chronic pain undergoing evaluation for spinal cord stimulation. Externalized ends of the epidural leads were connected to an external amplifier to capture SEGs. Electromyographic and accelerometry data from the upper and lower extremities were collected using wireless sensors and synchronized to the SEG data. Patients were instructed to perform various arm and leg movements while SEG and kinematic data were collected.

No established therapy exists to prevent and/or ameliorate CIPN. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysregulation have been proposed to underlie the pathobiology of CIPN. However, interventions to prevent and treat CIPN are largely ineffective. Additional factors and mechanism-based targets need to be identified to develop novel strategies to target CIPN. The role of oxidative stress appears to be central, but the contribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress remains under-examined in the pathobiology of CIPN. This review describes the significance of ER stress and its contribution to CIPN, the protective role of herbal agents in countering ER stress in nervous system-associated disorders, and their possible repurposing for preventing CIPN.",Cancer;Drug Therapy;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress;Herbal;Needs;Nervous System;Oxidative Stress;Pain;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phytochemicals;Reactive Oxygen Species;Review;Role;Therapeutics,Cancer;Pain;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,Antioxidants (Basel),Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Not,Translating Discoveries to Devices for Effective Pain Treatment

Despite treatment advances and improvements in clinical management to prevent bleeding, management of acute and chronic pain remains to be established. Repeated bleeding of the joints leads to arthropathy, causing pain in hemophilia. However, mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of pain in hemophilia remain underexamined. Herein, we describe the novel perspectives on the role for oxidative stress in the periphery and the central nervous system that may contribute to pain in hemophilia. Specifically, we cross examine preclinical and clinical studies that address the contribution of oxidative stress in hemophilia and related diseases that affect synovial tissue to induce acute and potentially chronic pain.
